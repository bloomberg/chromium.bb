# Introduction

This directory defines a wrapper around the LibCast implementation of Cast
Streaming (found in //third_party/openscreen/src) to allow for integration with
the Chromium Renderer pipeline.

Currently, this code is used in production //fuchsia code, with further uses in
progress.

TODO(crbug.com/1208196): Expand upon this file.
