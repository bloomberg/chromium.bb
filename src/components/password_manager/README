Password manager component is layered, see https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/design-documents/layered-components-design for what it means.

Ideal structure of the component:
- core/: Essentials, not depending on any other layers.
All other layers may depend on core:
- content/: Content-specific embedding.
- sync/: Sync-specific embedding.
