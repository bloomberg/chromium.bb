// Abstract interface to track whether a change password flow leads to a
// successful update of a credential.
// Usage notes:
// - The type of a change password flow is defined by three enums, a
//   |StartEvent| defining how the flow was started, an |EndEvent| defining
//   how the flow terminated and an |EntryPoint| defining from where in the
//   browser the flow was started. See the enum definitions for details.
// - URL parameters in the passed to the tracker are the URLs of the current
//   page. The tracker normalizes these to eTLD+1 for matching.
