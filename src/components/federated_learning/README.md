# Federated Learning Component
The FLoC (Federated Learning of Cohorts) project aims to group users based on
their browsing habits in a privacy preserving way, that would allow
interest-based advertising without exposing a userâ€™s browsing history.

This component contains data types (e.g. FlocID) that other layers could access
(e.g. chrome/browser, services/network).
