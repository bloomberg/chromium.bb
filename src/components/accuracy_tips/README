This directory stores files related to Chrome's accuracy tips.

If Chrome believes a site a user is visiting is low accuracy, Chrome may
show a pop-up while visiting the page. This popup won't block users from
entering a site and it will be strictly rate-limited to avoid being annoying.

Currently this code is only used for Chrome on desktop but in the long term
we have plans for Android and iOS and potentially Weblayer as well.
