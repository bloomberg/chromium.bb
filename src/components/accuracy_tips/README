This directory stores files related to Chrome's accuracy tips.

When users visit news-related sites, Chrome may show a pop-up while visiting the
page. This popup won't block users from entering a site and it will be strictly
rate-limited to avoid being annoying.

Currently this code is only used for Chrome on desktop but in the long term
we have plans for Android and iOS and potentially Weblayer as well.
