    <description summary="surface composition delegation">
      The global interface exposing surface delegated composition
      capabilities is used to instantiate an interface extension for a
      wl_surface object. This extended interface will then allow
      delegated compostion of the surface contents, effectively
      disconnecting the direct relationship between the buffer and the
      surface content (adding support for solid quads and rounded corner
      for instance).
