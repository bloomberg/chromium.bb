This is a layered component that allows embedders to filter urls.

Directory structure:

**content/** -
contains logic that relies on //content for
use on platforms that embed //content (e.g. Desktop, Android).


**core/** - contains logic that can be shared across
content-embedding platforms and others (e.g. Desktop, Android, iOS).
