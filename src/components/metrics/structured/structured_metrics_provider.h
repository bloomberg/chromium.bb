// StructuredMetricsProvider is responsible for filling out the
// |structured_metrics_event| section of the UMA proto. This class should not be
// instantiated except by the ChromeMetricsServiceClient. This class is not
// thread safe and should only be called on the browser UI sequence, because
// calls from the metrics service come on the UI sequence.
//
// Initialization of the StructuredMetricsProvider must wait until a profile is
// added, because state is stored within the profile directory. Initialization
// happens in several steps:
//
// 1. A StructuredMetricsProvider instance is constructed and owned by the
//    MetricsService. It registers itself as an observer of
//    metrics::structured::Recorder.
//
// 2. When a profile is added that is eligible for recording,
//    ChromeMetricsServiceClient calls Recorder::ProfileAdded, which notifies
//    this class.
//
// 3. This class then begins initialization by asynchronously reading keys and
//    unsent logs from the cryptohome.
//
// 4. If the read succeeds, initialization is complete and this class starts
//    accepting events to record.
//
// After initialization, this class accepts events to record from
// StructuredMetricsProvider::OnRecord via Recorder::Record via
// EventBase::Record. These events are not uploaded immediately, and are cached
// in ready-to-upload form.
//
// On a call to ProvideCurrentSessionData, the cache of unsent logs is added to
// a ChromeUserMetricsExtension for upload, and is then cleared.
