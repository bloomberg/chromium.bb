// - all metrics are uploaded in the main UMA upload
//
// New behaviour:
// - Projects with id type 'uma' are uploaded in the main UMA uploaded
// - Projects with id type 'project-id' or 'none' are uploaded independently.

// Once we are comfortable with this change, this parameter can be removed.
