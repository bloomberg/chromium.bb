//
// A worker is the equivalent of a thread on the web platform. To do
// asynchronous work, a frame can create a dedicated worker or a shared worker
// with Javascript. Those workers can now be used by sending an asynchronous
// message using the postMessage() method, and replies can be received by
// registering a message handler on the worker object.
//
// One notable special case is that dedicated workers can be nested. That means
// that a dedicated worker can create another dedicated worker which is then
// only accessible from the parent worker.
//
// Service workers are different. Instead of being created by the javascript
// when needed, a service worker is registered once and affects all frames and
// dedicated/shared workers whose URL matches the scope of the service worker.
// A service worker is mainly used to intercept network requests and optionally
// serve the responses from a cache, making the web site work offline.
//
// A client, from the point of view of the worker, is the frame or worker that
// caused the worker to start running, either because it explicitly created it,
// or a service worker is registered to handle their network requests.
