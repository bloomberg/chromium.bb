// The policy half of the TabLoadingFrameNavigation system. The policy engine
// is responsible for deciding which WebContents will be throttled, and within
// a WebContents, which frames. Since the decision has to be made synchronously
// on the UI thread before the PM counterparts exist, this policy exposes
// helper functions for "pulling" those decisions from the policy engine, rather
// than having them "pushed" to the mechanism. Once throttling has started the
// subsequent policy decision of when to stop throttling is pushed to the
// mechanism as is more typical. By default the policy object will connect to
// the TabLoadingFrameNavigationScheduler as its policy mechanism, but this can
// be overridden for tests.
//
// At this moment the policy is the following:
//
// - Only pages using http or https are throttled.
// - Main frames are never throttled.
// - Child frames with the same eTLD+1 as the main frame are not throttled.
// - All other frames are throttled.
// - Throttling continues until the main frame hits hits LargestContentfulPaint.
//   Unfortunately, we can't know LCP in real time, so we use
//   2 x FirstContentfulPaint as an estimate, with an upper bound of the UMA
//   measures 95th %ile of LCP.
//
// See design document:
