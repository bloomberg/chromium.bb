      The policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such
      as '*.example.com') for which security restrictions on insecure origins
      will not apply.

      The intent is to allow organisations to set whitelist origins for legacy
      applications that cannot deploy TLS, or to set up a staging server for
      internal web development so that their developers can test out features
      requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging
      server. This policy will also prevent the origin from being labelled
      'Not Secure' in the omnibox.

      Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the
      command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a
      comma-separated list of the same URLs. If the policy is set, it will
      override the command-line flag.

      This policy will override UnsafelyTreatInsecureOriginAsSecure, if present.

In order to coalesce, both the hostname of the potential new connection and the hostname of an existing connection must match one or more patterns described by this policy. The policy is a list of hosts using the URLBlacklist filter format: 'example.com' matches 'example.com' and all subdomains (e.g. 'sub.example.com'), while '.example.net' matches exactly 'example.net'.

      Coalescing requests to different hosts over connections that use client certificates can create security and privacy issues, as the ambient authority will be conveyed to all requests, even if the user did not explicitly authorise this. This policy is temporary and will be removed in a future release. See https://crbug.com/855690.

      also cause https://foo.example.com/ to be isolated as part of the
      https://example.com/ site.

If a server performs version negotiation correctly (i.e. without breaking the connection) then this setting doesn't apply. Regardless, the resulting connection must still comply with SSLVersionMin.

      If this policy is not configured or if it is set to "tls1.2" then <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" /> no longer performs this fallback. Note that this does not disable support for older TLS versions, only whether <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" /> will work around buggy servers which cannot negotiate versions correctly.

      Otherwise, if compatibility with a buggy server must be maintained, this policy may be set to "tls1.1". This is a stopgap measure and the server should be rapidly fixed.</translation>

      <ph name="PRINTER_EFFECTIVE_MODEL" /> must match one of the strings which represent a <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" />-supported printer. The string will be used to identify and install the appropriate PPD for the printer. More information can be found at https://support.google.com/chrome?p=noncloudprint.

      Printer setup is completed upon the first use of a printer. PPDs are not downloaded until the printer is used. After that time, frequently used PPDs are cached.

          The |time_usage_limit| specifies a daily screen quota, so when the user reaches it, the user's session is locked. There is a property for each day of the week, and it should be set only if there is an active quota for that day. |usage_quota_mins| is the amount of time that the managed device can be used in a day and |reset_at| is the time when the usage quota is renewed. The default value for |reset_at| is midnight ({'hour': 0, 'minute': 0}). |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time that this entry was updated; it is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

          * |UNLOCK| unlocks a user's session locked by time_window_limit or time_usage_limit.

      This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

      In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, the hash must be of a subjectPublicKeyInfo appearing in a CA certificate that is recognised as a Legacy Certificate Authority (CA). A Legacy CA is a CA that has been publicly trusted by one or more operating systems supported by <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" />, but is not trusted by the Android Open Source Project or <ph name="PRODUCT_OS_NAME" />.

      A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the '/' character and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognised hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is 'sha256'.

<translation id="3904459740090265495">This policy controls the sign-in behaviour of the browser. It allows you to specify if the user can sign in to <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" /> with their account and use account-related services such as Chrome Sync.

      If the policy is set to 'Disable browser sign-in', the user cannot sign in to the browser and use account-based services. In this case browser-level features such as Chrome Sync cannot be used and will be unavailable. If the user was signed in and the policy is set 'Disabled', they will be signed out the next time that they run Chrome but their local profile data such as bookmarks, passwords, etc. will stay preserved. The user will still be able to sign in to and use Google web services such as Gmail.

      If the policy is set to 'Enable browser sign-in', the user is allowed to sign in to the browser and is automatically signed in to the browser when signed in to Google web services such as Gmail. Being signed in to the browser means that the user's account information will be kept by the browser. However, it does not mean that Chrome Sync will be turned on per default; the user must separately opt in to use this feature. Enabling this policy will prevent the user from turning off the setting that allows browser sign-in. To control the availability of Chrome Sync, use the 'SyncDisabled' policy.

      If the policy is set to 'Force browser sign-in', the user is presented with an account selection dialogue and has to choose and sign in to an account to use the browser. This ensures that for managed accounts the policies associated with the account are applied and enforced. By default this turns on Chrome Sync for the account, except for the case when sync was disabled by the domain admin or via the 'SyncDisabled' policy. The default value of BrowserGuestModeEnabled will be set to false. Note: Existing unsigned profiles will be locked and inaccessible after enabling this policy. For more information, see help centre article: https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7572556.

      If this policy is not set then the user can decide if they want to enable the browser sign-in option and use it as they see fit.</translation>

      You might want to look at the IsolateOriginsAndroid policy setting to get the best of both worlds – isolation and limited impact for users – by using IsolateOriginsAndroid, with a list of sites that you want to isolate. This setting, SitePerProcessAndroid, isolates all sites.
      If the policy is enabled, each site will run in its own process.
      If the policy is disabled, no explicit Site Isolation will happen and field trials of IsolateOriginsAndroid and SitePerProcessAndroid will be disabled. However, users will still be able to facilitate SitePerProcess manually.
      If the policy is not configured, the user will be able to change this setting.

      NOTE: On Android, Site Isolation is experimental. Support will improve over time, but currently it may cause performance problems.

      NOTE: This policy only applies to Chrome on Android, running on devices with strictly more than 1 GB of RAM. To apply the policy on non-Android platforms, use SitePerProcess.

      This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

      In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, one of the following conditions must be met:
      1. The hash is of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo.
      2. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, that CA certificate is constrained via the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName contains an organizationName attribute.
      3. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate contains the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

      A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the '/' character and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognised hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is 'sha256'.

      If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.</translation>

<translation id="8938932171964587769">Deprecated in M69. Use
      OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin instead.

      The policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such
      as '*.example.com') for which security restrictions on insecure origins
      will not apply.

      The intent is to allow organisations to whitelist origins for legacy
      applications that cannot deploy TLS, or to set up a staging server for
      internal web development so that their developers can test out features
      requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging
      server. This policy will also prevent the origin from being labelled
      'Not Secure' in the omnibox.

      Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the
      command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a
      comma-separated list of the same URLs. If the policy is set, it will
      override the command-line flag.

      This policy is deprecated in M69 in favour of
      OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin. If both policies are
      present, OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin will override this
      policy.
