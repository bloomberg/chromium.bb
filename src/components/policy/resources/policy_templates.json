# policy_templates.json - Metafile for policy templates
#
# The content of this file is evaluated as a Python expression.
#
# This file is used as input to generate the following policy templates:
# ADM, ADMX+ADML, MCX/plist and html documentation.
#
# Policy templates are user interface definitions or documents about the
# policies that can be used to configure Chrome. Each policy is a name-value
# pair where the value has a given type. Chrome looks up the values using the
# names of the policies. In the user interface where the values can be set,
# related policies might appear together in policy groups. The grouping is not
# visible to Chrome.
#
# This file contains a list of policies and groups. Each group contains a list
# of policies under the key 'policies'. All the policies and groups must have
# unique names. Group names are not exposed to Chrome at all.
#
# Each policy has a type. The currently implemented types:
#   'group': - not a real policy, contains a list of policies
#     NOTE: Currently nesting groups inside other groups is not supported.
#   'string' - a string value
#   'int' - an integer value
#   'int-enum' - the user can select an integer value from a collection of
#     items
#   'string-enum' - the user can select a string value from a collection of
#     items
#   'string-enum-list' - the user can select a set of string values from a
#     collection of items
#   'main' - a boolean value
#   'list' - a list of string values. Using this for a list of JSON strings
#     is now discouraged, because the 'dict' is better for JSON.
#   'dict' - perhaps should be named JSON. An arbitrarily complex object or
#     array, nested objects/arrays, etc. The user defines the value with JSON.
#   'external' - a policy that references external data.
#     NOTE: This type is currently supported on Chrome OS only.
#
# NOTE to 'dict' vs 'list' - in the past, 'list' has been used for a policy
# that is an array of objects. The user supplied a list of strings, and each
# of those strings was parsed as JSON, resulting in an array of objects.
# However, there are a couple of reasons why 'dict' is better for these sorts
# of policies. Some interfaces (eg the GPO editor) only allow each list item
# to be a single-line string, which is not great for inputting a complex JSON
# object. It also means any example values shown in the documentation will
# have a hybrid syntax, with both commas and new-lines being used to delimit
# array elements - and these examples will be harder to copy and paste.
# To conclude, prefer 'dict' to 'list' if JSON is involved.
#
# Each policy is tagged with risk tags that indicate potential privacy or
# security risks. They are defined at the beginning of this file (tag
# 'risk_tag_definitions').
# Each risk tag contains the following information:
#   - name: The name of the risk tag. May not contain spaces.
#   - description: Description for developers so they know which tags apply to
#       newly added policies.
#   - user-description: A text that helps users understand what a policy with
#       this tag means for their privacy and/or security.
#
# Policy group descriptions, policy captions and similar texts are localized
# strings taken from the <message> nodes of the .grd file. Their name attributes
# are generated from the JSON keys.
# Each item (policy or group) may have the following messages:
#   - description:
#     Describes the item it applies to.
#   - caption
#     A short, one-line summary of the item it applies to. This can appear
#     both in policy or group listings or on title bars of policy-setting
#     windows. (The caption should not end with a punctuation mark.)
#   - label (Optional, defaults to caption if not specified.)
#     A short, one-line summary of the item it applies to. The difference
#     from caption is that label always appears next to the entry field
#     where the value of the policy can be entered. 'main' policies on
#     Windows ignore this. Policies on Mac are using this instead of caption.
#
# As a reference for translators, non-translatable strings must be tagged using
# <ph name="..."></ph> as described in [1]. As these tags are pruned before
# generating the comments for .proto files, paragraphs containing such tags
# should not be line-wrapped (use one long line per paragraph instead) to allow
# for correct re-flowing of the text.
# [1] https://www.chromium.org/developers/tools-we-use-in-chromium/grit/grit-users-guide.
#
# See documentation in docs/enterprise/components/policy/resources/description_guidelines.md
# for how product names should appear in <ph> tags to ensure consistency.
#
#
# Generated grd names:
#   Each name has two parts: the second part is either CAPTION, DESC or LABEL,
#   and the first part identifies the item the text applies to:
#   -For policies and groups:
#     IDS_POLICY_<NAME OF THE POLICY OR GROUP>
#     e.g. the name of the caption of policy HomepageLocation:
#       IDS_POLICY_HOMEPAGELOCATION_CAPTION
#     or other messages of the policy HomepageLocation:
#       IDS_POLICY_HOMEPAGELOCATION_LABEL
#       IDS_POLICY_HOMEPAGELOCATION_DESC
#   -For enum items:
#     IDS_POLICY_ENUM_<NAME OF THE ITEM>
#     e.g. the name of the caption of ProxyServerDisabled:
#       IDS_POLICY_ENUM_PROXYSERVERDISABLED_CAPTION
#
#   Each policy has the list of platforms where it is supported under the key
#   'supported_on' or 'future_on'. The 'supported_on' lists all released
#   platforms while the 'future_on' is used to enumerate platforms where the
#   feature is not yet ready for use in production environments. Any unreleased
#   platforms is hidden from policy templates and documentation. The policy
#   definition in the source code is generated for platforms in both lists.
#
#   The format of the 'supported_on' is '<platform>:<since_version>-<until_version>'.
#   It means the policy is officially released on the |platform| from
#   |since_version| and is removed after |until_version|. |until_version|
#   is optional.
#
#   The format of the 'future_on' list entries is '<platform>'.
#   There is no version range attached to it and the policy is available in the
#   Dev and Canary channel only unless it's listed in the
#   EnableExperimentalPolicies policy.
#
#   Currently supported platforms:
#       'chrome.win', 'chrome.win7', 'chrome.mac', 'chrome.linux', 'chrome.*'
#       'chrome_os', 'android', 'webview_android', 'ios', 'chrome_frame'
#   Note that 'chrome_frame' has been deprecated.
#
# Annotations:
#   'example_value' is used in the generated documentation and example policy
#   configuration files. Examples must cover the entire schema, i.e. use every
#   defined property at least once.
#
#   'default' is used to provide a machine readable way of indicating the
#   behavior of the controlled setting/feature when the policy is not set. For
#   example, if 'default' is set to True, it documents that when the policy is
#   not set, the feature controlled by the policy will behave in the same way
#   it would behave if the policy was set to True.
#   This field is only used for policies of type 'int', 'main', 'string-enum',
#   or 'int-enum'. Other policy types are assumed to have a default equal to
#   an empty string or empty list. If the default value can't be expressed with
#   the given type and is equivalent to unset, it should be represent with None.
#   For example, this would be used for a boolean policy where unset means the
#   user can turn the feature on and off, while a set policy will force the
#   feature to always be on or off.
#   Note that this is different from 'default_for_enterprise_users', as that
#   flag sets a policy value for managed users if the policy is not set by some
#   other policy source (such as cloud policy). It is also different from
#   'default_for_managed_devices_doc_only', which documents an explicitly
#   implemented default policy value for managed devices.
#
#   'items' is used to outline the behavior of each state the policy can take.
#   This field is only used for policies of type 'main', 'int-enum', or
#   'string-enum'. For 'main' policies, it describes how the policy behaves when
#   set to True or False, and whether the unset state is different from the
#   enabled/disabled states. For 'enum' policies, it lists all possible values
#   the policy can be set to along with a brief description.
#
#   Additional information is specified under the 'features' key:
#   'dynamic_refresh' controls if the generated documentation should state that
#   the policy supports dynamic refresh or not. Supporting dynamic refresh means
#   that Chrome respects the changes to the policy immediately, without the need
#   for restart.
#   'can_be_mandatory' Set to False to suppress the policy in the generated
#   mandatory policy templates. The generated documentation for the policy
#   will contain a suitable hint for administrators.
#   'can_be_recommended' Set to True to include the policy in the generated
#   recommended policy templates. The generated documentation for the policy
#   will contain a suitable hint for administrators.
#   Policies settings in the mandatory template override user preferences, while
#   recommended policies provide a default setting that may be overridden by the
#   user. By default, each policy is mandatory and not recommended.
#   'per_profile' controls whether a user policy applies to every user logging
#   into the browser or only one profile.
#   'cloud_only' Set to True if the policy is forced or recommended to set from
#   Admin console only. This hides the policy from policy templates and Chrome
#   documentation in policy_templates.zip. The documentation will NOT be hidden
#   from the https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/.
#   'platform_only' Set to True if the policy can only be set from platform
#   policy but do not support Admin console. This is only used as a hint for
#   Admin console.
#   'internal_only' Set to True if the policy is used for internal development
#   or testing purposes and will never be used by any external administrator.
#   'unlisted' Set to True if the policy is controlled by Admin Console
#   without any user interface for administrator. It can only be used for
#   policies with the 'cloud_only' tag. Policy with the 'unlisted' tag will be
#   hidden from all documentations, policy templates and Admin Console UI.
#   'metapolicy_type' determines the type of metapolicy a policy is. A
#   metapolicy is a policy which affects how other policies are applied.
#   Precedence metapolicies affect how policies are prioritized depending on
#   their scope, source, and other factors. Merging metapolicies determine which
#   list or dictionary policies can have their values combined into a single
#   policy. If the setting is missing, it is assumed that the policy is not a
#   metapolicy. The supported types are 'merge' (example policy is
#   PolicyListMultipleSourceMergeList) and 'precedence' (example policy is
#   CloudPolicyOverridesPlatformPolicy).
#
#   The 'max_size' key is used to specify the maximal size of the external data
#   that a policy can reference, in bytes. This annotation is compulsory for
#   policies of type 'external'. It is ignored for all other policy types.
#
# Schemas:
#   All policies have a key 'schema' which describes the schema of the policy.
#   This schema supports a subset of the JSON Schema standard
#   (https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/index.html). For more
#   information see //components/policy/tools/schema_validator.py. This
#   validator is also used during presubmit to validate all schemas,
#   validation_schemas and the example_values. On the client-side we use
#   //components/policy/core/common/schema.h to validate policy values against
#   the provided schemas in this file. This validator supports the same subset
#   of features supported by the python schema validator used during presubmit.
#
#   For many policies this is simply a type eg 'boolean' or 'string', but for
#   'dict' policies this describes the types of not only the root object, but
#   also all of its descendants. This schema data is used to validate 'dict'
#   policies, if a SchemaValidatingPolicyHandler is configured appropriately in
#   configuration_policy_handler_list_factory.cc
#
#   Some policies at first seem to have simple schema e.g. a string or a list of
#   strings, but those strings are actually JSON strings, and this JSON has
#   another schema. This type of policy is deprecated. When adding new policies,
#   make sure the entire schema is described by the 'schema' field and that
#   there are no strings which contain JSON.
#   The legacy policies which contain JSON strings have an extra field, the
#   'validation_schema' which is used to validate not only the schema of the
#   policy itself, but also the content of the JSON strings inside the policy.
#   Do not use this field when adding new policies.
#
#   In order to hide sensitive policy values from the user, you can use
#   'sensitiveValue': True (default 'False') in the associated schema. Those
#   values will be masked with '********' in the chrome://policy UI and policy
#   exports. 'sensitiveValue' can be applied to all schema types.
#
#   For some policies which have complicated schema we add either
#   'description_schema' which describes some but not necessarily all properties
#   of the policy or 'url_schema' which contains the link to the expanded
#   documentation.
#   Note that 'description_schema' is used for documentation purposes only, but
#   not for schema validation. It can be used in cases where validation is not
#   desired, e.g. if the schema does not describe all properties (see
#   ArcPolicy).
#
#   TODO(crbug.com/960274): Add translations of the schemas.
#
# IDs:
#   Since a Protocol Buffer definition is generated from this file, unique and
#   persistent IDs for all fields (but not for groups!) are needed. These are
#   specified by the 'id' keys of each policy. NEVER CHANGE EXISTING IDs,
#   because doing so would break the deployed wire format!
#   For your editing convenience:
#   The highest ID currently used is always set in the
#   'highest_id_currently_used' value at the end of this file.
#   And don't forget to also update the EnterprisePolicies enum of
#   histograms.xml (run 'python tools/metrics/histograms/update_policies.py').
#   A policy can be deleted from this file if and only if it is never launched;
#   in which case its id must be added to the 'deleted_policy_ids' list to
#   prevent reuse.
#
# Ownership:
#   Each policy has an 'owners' field. This field is a list of strings which
#   describe the group of people responsible for maintaining the policy and can
#   help answer questions or solve issues with the policy. The entries can be
#   either emails of committers or file:// references to OWNERS files in the
#   Chromium repository.
#
# Placeholders:
#   The following placeholder strings are automatically substituted:
#     $1 -> Google Chrome / Chromium
#     $2 -> Google Chrome OS / Chromium OS
#     $3 -> Google Chrome Frame / Chromium Frame
#     $6 is reserved for doc_writer
#
# Device Policy:
#   An additional flag 'device_only' (optional, defaults to False) indicates
#   that this policy is only supported as a device-level Cloud Policy. In that
#   case no entry in the UserPolicy Protobuf is generated and it is assumed that
#   it will be added to the DevicePolicy Protobuf manually. Device policy only
#   exists on Chrome OS.
#
# Management Type:
#   Chrome OS devices can either be managed through the Google cloud or through
#   Active Directory. Most policies are supported for both management types, but
#   some are not. To indicate supported management types, use
#     'supported_chrome_os_management': ['google_cloud', 'active_directory'],
#   where
#     'google_cloud' = Policy is supported for Google cloud management.
#     'active_directory' = Policy is supported for Active Directory management.
#   This setting applies to Chrome OS only. If the setting is missing, both
#   types are assumed. The array must not be empty.
#
# Enterprise defaults for user policy:
#   For managed users on Chrome OS (i.e. users receiving user policy from the
#   cloud), if the optional key 'default_for_enterprise_users' is set, its value
#   is applied as mandatory policy unless a different setting is received from
#   the cloud. This default value handling is automatically enforced by the
#   policy stack when filling the PolicyMap (specifically, by the generated
#   function SetEnterpriseUsersDefaults).
#
# Enterprise defaults for device policy:
#   The optional key 'default_for_managed_devices_doc_only' can be used to
#   document a differing default value for devices enrolled into enterprise
#   management. This is for documentation only - the enrollment-dependent
#   handling must be manually implemented.
#
# Atomic Policy Group:
#   An atomic policy group is a group of policies that logically belong together
#   and influence a certain aspect of the browser only when considered together
#   and should be treated as a single policy when merging policies from multiple
#   sources. They all have to be set in the same source to take effect. In case
#   members of a policy group are set at different sources, only the policies
#   from the source with the highest priority will be used.

      If the policy is set to "Disable browser sign-in" then the user cannot sign in to the browser and use account-based services. In this case browser-level features like <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> Sync cannot be used and will be unavailable. On <ph name="IOS_NAME">iOS</ph>, if the user was signed in and the policy is set to "Disabled" they will be signed out immediately. On other platforms, they will be signed out the next time they run <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph>. On all platforms, their local profile data like bookmarks, passwords etc. will be preserved and still usable. The user will still be able to sign into and use Google web services like Gmail.

      If the policy is set to "Enable browser sign-in," then the user is allowed to sign in to the browser. On all platforms except <ph name="IOS_NAME">iOS</ph>, the user is automatically signed in to the browser when signed in to Google web services like Gmail. Being signed in to the browser means the user's account information will be kept by the browser. However, it does not mean that <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> Sync will be turned on by default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature. Enabling this policy will prevent the user from turning off the setting that allows browser sign-in. To control the availability of <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> Sync, use the <ph name="SYNC_POLICY_NAME">SyncDisabled</ph> policy.

      If the policy is set to "Force browser sign-in" the user is presented with an account selection dialog and has to choose and sign in to an account to use the browser. This ensures that for managed accounts the policies associated with the account are applied and enforced. The default value of <ph name="GUEST_MODE_POLICY_NAME">BrowserGuestModeEnabled</ph> will be set to disabled. Note that existing unsigned profiles will be locked and inaccessible after enabling this policy. For more information, see help center article: https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7572556 . This option is not supported on <ph name="LINUX_OS_NAME">Linux</ph>, <ph name="ANDROID_NAME">Android</ph> or <ph name="IOS_NAME">iOS</ph>. It will fall back to "Enable browser sign-in" if used.

      If this policy is not set then the user can decide if they want to enable browser sign-in in the <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME">$1<ex>Google Chrome</ex></ph> settings and use it as they see fit.''',

      * Customize free-form <ph name="PRINTER_DISPLAY_NAME">display_name</ph> and <ph name="PRINTER_DESCRIPTION">description</ph> for ease of printer selection.

      * Help users identify printers using <ph name="PRINTER_MANUFACTURER">manufacturer</ph> and <ph name="PRINTER_MODEL">model</ph>.

      * <ph name="PRINTER_URI">uri</ph> should be an address reachable from a client computer, including the <ph name="URI_SCHEME">scheme</ph>, <ph name="URI_PORT">port</ph>, and <ph name="URI_QUEUE">queue</ph>.

      * Optionally provide <ph name="PRINTER_UUID">uuid</ph> to help deduplicate <ph name="ZEROCONF_DISCOVERY">zeroconf</ph> printers.

      * Either use the model name for <ph name="PRINTER_EFFECTIVE_MODEL">effective_model</ph> or set <ph name="PRINTER_AUTOCONF">autoconf</ph> to True. Printers with both or no properties get ignored.

      PPDs are downloaded after the printer is used, and frequently used PPDs are cached. This policy doesn't affect whether users can configure printers on individual devices.

      The intent is to allow organizations to allow origins for legacy applications that cannot deploy TLS, or to set up a staging server for internal web development so that their developers can test out features requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging server. This policy will also prevent the origin from being labeled "Not Secure" in the omnibox.

      Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a comma-separated list of the same URLs. If the policy is set, it will override the command-line flag.

      This policy is deprecated in M69 in favor of OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin. If both policies are present, OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin will override this policy.

          The |time_window_limit| specifies a daily window in which the user's session should be locked. We only support one rule for each day of the week, therefore the |entries| array may vary from 0-7 in size. |starts_at| and |ends_at| are the beginning and the end of the window limit, when |ends_at| is smaller than |starts_at| it means that the |time_limit_window| ends on the following day. |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time this entry was updated, it is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

          The |time_usage_limit| specifies a daily screen quota, so when the user reaches it, the user's session is locked. There is a property for each day of the week, and it should be set only if there is an active quota for that day. |usage_quota_mins| is the amount of time that the managed device can be use in a day and |reset_at| is the time when the usage quota is renewed. The default value for |reset_at| is midnight ({'hour': 0, 'minute': 0}). |last_updated_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the last time this entry was updated, it is sent as a string because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer.

          |overrides| is provided to invalidate temporarily one or more of the previous rules.
          * If neither time_window_limit nor time_usage_limit is active |LOCK| can be used to lock the device.
          * |LOCK| temporarily locks a user session until the next time_window_limit or time_usage_limit starts.
          * |UNLOCK| unlocks a user's session locked by time_window_limit or time_usage_limit.
          |created_time_millis| is the UTC timestamp for the override creation, it is sent as a String because the timestamp wouldn't fit in an integer It is used to determine whether this override should still be applied. If the current active time limit feature (time usage limit or time window limit) started after the override was created, it should not take action. Also if the override was created before the last change of the active time_window_limit or time_usage_window it should not be applied.

A tag corresponding to an 'enable' pattern will be included in the analysis request if the page URL matches a pattern associated to that tag as long as no 'disable' pattern with that same tag matches the page URL. The analysis occurs if at least 1 tag is to be included in the request.

      The <ph name="ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR_SERVICE_PROVIDER_FIELD">service_provider</ph> field identifies which analysis service provider the settings correspond to.

      The <ph name="ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR_BLOCK_UNTIL_VERDICT_FIELD">block_until_verdict</ph> field being set to 1 means Chrome will wait to get a response from the analysis service before giving the user access to the downloaded file. Any other integer value means Chrome gives the user access to the file immediately.

      The <ph name="ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR_BLOCK_PASSWORD_PROTECTED_FIELD">block_password_protected</ph> field controls whether Chrome blocks or allows files that are password protected.

      The <ph name="ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR_BLOCK_LARGE_FILES_FIELD">block_large_files</ph> fields controls whether Chrome blocks or allows files that are too large to be analyzed.

      The <ph name="ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR_REQUIRE_JUSTIFICATION_TAGS_FIELD">require_justification_tags</ph> field is used to determine for which tags the connector should require the user to enter a justification to bypass a scan that results in a bypassable warning. If the field is not set, it's assumed that a justification is not required.

      The <ph name="ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR_CUSTOM_MESSAGES_FIELD">custom_messages</ph>, <ph name="ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR_MESSAGE_FIELD">message</ph>, <ph name="ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR_LEARN_MORE_URL_FIELD">learn_more_url</ph>, <ph name="ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR_LANGUAGE_FIELD">language</ph> and <ph name="ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR_TAG_FIELD">tag</ph> fields are used to configure a message to show the user when a warning is shown after a scan had a non-clean verdict. The message field contains the text to show the user and should have at most 200 characters. The learn_more_url field contains an admin-provided URL that will be clickable by the user to get more customer-provided information about why the action was blocked. The language field is optional and contains the language of the message. An empty language field or a value of 'default' indicates a message to be used when the user's language doesn't have a message. The tag field specifies for which type of scans the message is displayed. The custom_messages list can have zero or more entries, where each entry is required to have non-empty message and tag fields.

A tag corresponding to an 'enable' pattern will be included in the analysis request if the page URL matches a pattern associated to that tag as long as no 'disable' pattern with that same tag matches the page URL. The analysis occurs if at least 1 tag is to be included in the request.

      The <ph name="ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR_SERVICE_PROVIDER_FIELD">service_provider</ph> field identifies which analysis service provider the settings correspond to.

      The <ph name="ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR_BLOCK_UNTIL_VERDICT_FIELD">block_until_verdict</ph> field being set to 1 means Chrome will wait to get a response from the analysis service before giving the page access to the file. Any other integer value means Chrome gives the page access to the file immediately.

      The <ph name="ENTERPRISE_CONNECTOR_BLOCK_PASSWORD_PROTECTED_FIELD">block_password_protected</ph> field controls whether Chrome blocks or allows files that are password protected.

The message field contains the text to show the user and should have at most 200 characters. The learn_more_url field contains an admin-provided URL that will be clickable by the user to get more customer-provided information about why the action was blocked. The language field is optional and contains the language of the message. An empty language field or a value of 'default' indicates a message to be used when the user's language doesn't have a message.

      Data leak can happen by copying and pasting data, transferring files, printing, screensharing, or taking screenshots ...etc.

      Each rule consists of the following:
      - A list of sources defined as URLs. Any data in the sources will be considered confidential data, to which the restrictions will be applied.
      - A list of destinations defined as URLs or components, to which the confidential data is either allowed or disallowed to be shared.
      - A list of restrictions to be applied on the data of the sources.

      Rules can be added to:
      - Control the clipboard data shared between the sources and the destinations.
      - Control taking screenshots of any of the sources.
      - Control printing of any of the sources.
      - Control the privacy screen when any of the sources is visible.
      - Control screen sharing of any of the sources.

      The restriction level can be set to BLOCK, ALLOW, REPORT, WARN.
      - If the restriction level is set to BLOCK, the action won't be allowed. If <ph name="DATA_LEAK_PREVENTION_REPORTING_ENABLED">DataLeakPreventionReportingEnabled</ph> is set to True, the blocked action will be reported to the admin.
      - If the restriction level is set to ALLOW, the action will be allowed.
      - If the restriction level is set to REPORT and <ph name="DATA_LEAK_PREVENTION_REPORTING_ENABLED">DataLeakPreventionReportingEnabled</ph> is set to True, the action will be reported to the admin.
      - If the restriction level is set to WARN, a user will be warned and may choose to proceed with or cancel the action. If <ph name="DATA_LEAK_PREVENTION_REPORTING_ENABLED">DataLeakPreventionReportingEnabled</ph> is set to True, showing the warning will be reported to the admin; proceeding with the action will also be reported.

      Notes:
      - PRIVACY_SCREEN restriction doesn't block the ability to turn on privacy screen, but enforces it when the restriction class is set to BLOCK.
      - Destinations cannot be empty in case one of the restrictions is CLIPBOARD, but they don't make any difference for the remaining restrictions.
      - Format the URL patterns according to this format ( https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blocklist-filter-format ).

      cluster allows isolating documents by origin. The developer-visible
      consequence of this is that the document.domain accessor can no longer
      be set.

      The default behaviour - when no Origin-Agent-Cluster: header has been set
      - changes in M106 from site-keyed to origin-keyed. If this policy

      documents without Origin-Agent-Cluster: headers will be assigned to
      site-keyed agent clusters. As a consequence, the document.domain accessor
      remains settable by default. This matches the legacy behaviour.

      'tags': ['system-security'],
      'desc': '''You can enable this policy to create a dictionary of file type extensions with a corresponding list of domains that will be exempted from file type extension-based download warnings. This lets enterprise administrators block file type extension-based download warnings for files that are associated with a listed domain. For example, if  the "jnlp" extension is associated with "website1.com", users would not see a warning when downloading "jnlp" files from "website1.com", but see a download warning when downloading "jnlp" files from "website2.com".

      Files with file type extensions specified for domains identified by this policy will still be subject to non-file type extension-based security warnings such as mixed-content download warnings and Safe Browsing warnings.

      If you disable this policy or don't configure it, file types that trigger extension-based download warnings will show warnings to the user.

      If you enable this policy:

      * The URL pattern should be formatted according to https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/url-patterns.
      * The file type extension entered must be in lower-cased ASCII. The leading separator should not be included when listing the file type extension, so list "jnlp" should be used instead of ".jnlp".

      Example:

      The following example value would prevent file type extension-based download warnings on swf, exe, and jnlp extensions for *.example.com domains. It will show the user a file type extension-based download warning on any other domain for exe and jnlp files, but not for swf files.

      [
        { "file_extension": "jnlp", "domains": ["example.com"] },
        { "file_extension": "exe", "domains": ["example.com"] },
        { "file_extension": "swf", "domains": ["*"] }
      ]

      Note that while the preceding example shows the suppression of file type extension-based download warnings for "swf" files for all domains, applying suppression of such warnings for all domains for any dangerous file type extension is not recommended due to security concerns. It is shown in the example merely to demonstrate the ability to do so.

      If this policy is enabled alongside <ph name="DOWNLOAD_RESTRICTIONS_POLICY_NAME">DownloadRestrictions</ph> and DownloadRestrictions is set to block dangerous file types, download blocks determined by DownloadRestrictions take precedence. For example, if this policy is set to enable "exe" extension downloads from "website1.com", and DownloadRestrictions is set to block malicious downloads and dangerous file types, then "exe" extension downloads will still be blocked in all domains. If DownloadRestrictions is not set to block dangerous file types, then file types specified in this policy will be exempted from file-type extension-based download warnings in the specified domains.
