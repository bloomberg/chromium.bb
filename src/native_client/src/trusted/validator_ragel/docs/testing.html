<p class="c0"><span>Basically it&rsquo;s a handful of python
functions which accept disassembly listing and say whether
it&rsquo;s correct from the sandboxing point of view.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>This executable specification is intended to be
more or less readable and automatically up-to-date.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Note that there is no goal to reflect all
validator quirks in the spec. For example, for purely technical
reason old validator (and consequently new one) rejects 16-bit
atomics. We plan to allow them eventually. Specification allows
them from the beginning.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>This specification is not a test per se, but it
is used in two sets of tests: targeted tests and exhaustive
validator tests.</span></p>
<h3 class="c0"><a name="h.exyvuj8cfycc" id=

<p class="c0"><span>These tests serve several purposes:</span></p>
<ol class="c5" start="1">
<li class="c1 c0"><span>as regression tests and convenient way to
report bugs and document behaviors</span></li>
<li class="c1 c0"><span>as positive tests for RDFA validator (other
tests only check that it rejects something that is unsafe, not that
it accepts what it&rsquo;s supposed to accept)</span></li>
<li class="c1 c0"><span>as negative tests for text-based
specification (in other places we only check that it allows what
RDFA actually accepts; here we can check that it&rsquo;s not too
forgiving)</span></li>
<li class="c0 c1"><span>as cheap, although incomplete, test suite
that can be run on bots consistently</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="c0"><span>There are about 200 manually written test files
(incorporating ~300 test cases) for 32- and 64-bit validators. They
originate from tests Karl used for old validator. Since then they
were supplemented with tests for most (hopefully, all) defects and
subtle behaviours we encountered during the work on RDFA validator.
They also include tests Mark used for his prototype DFA-based
validator. They are somewhat poorly structured, so sometimes it may
not be directly obvious where to find test case for a specific
problem, but there is a lot of stuff there.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Test format. Test files
(validator_ragel/testdata/32/*.test,
validator_ragel/testdata/64/*.test) consist of one or more test
cases separated by &lsquo;------------&rsquo;. Each test case
consists of sections. Example:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">@hex:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp; # This is the correct nop
case.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp; # nopw &nbsp;
0x0(%eax,%eax,1)</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp; 66 0f 1f 44 00 00</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">@dis:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;0:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66 0f 1f 44
00 00 &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nopw &nbsp;
0x0(%eax,%eax,1)</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">@rdfa_output:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp; return code: 0</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">@spec:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp; SAFE</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class=
"c4">----------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">@hex:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp; # This is an example where we
have incremented the nop by 1.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp; 66 0f 1f 44 00 01</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">@dis:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;0:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66 0f 1f 44
00 01 &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nopw &nbsp;
0x1(%eax,%eax,1)</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">@rdfa_output:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp; 0: [0] unrecognized
instruction</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp; return code: 1</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">@spec:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span class="c4">&nbsp; 0: unrecognized instruction
'nopw 0x1(%eax,%eax,1)'</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&lsquo;@hex&rsquo; section contains input data
as sequence of bytes. By convention, in complex cases bytes
corresponding to instruction are usually preceded with comment
specifying assembly form of the instruction. But this
correspondence is not enforced so in principle comments can lie. To
make it easier to spot errors in comments, there is a
&lsquo;@dis&rsquo; section containing output of nacl-objdump on
given input.</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&lsquo;@spec&rsquo; section contains expected
output of text-based ncval (which receives its input from @dis
section).</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&lsquo;@rdfa_output&rsquo; section contains
expected output of RDFA-based ncval (actually, it&rsquo;s processed
in a certain way, see</span> <span class="c3"><a class="c8" href=
"https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3037">https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3037</a></span><span>&nbsp;under
&lsquo;tricky part&rsquo; paragraph. In the ideal world this
simulation of error recovery won&rsquo;t be needed, as any test
would contain no more than one violation of sandboxing rules, but
for historical reasons we have tests with several errors in a
single chunk of code and we want to check them all. New tests
should exhibit only one failure per test case)</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>For each of these three sections there is a
dedicated scons target:</span></p>
<ol class="c5" start="1">
<li class="c1 c0"><span>Content of @dis is checked with ./scons
run_dis_section_test_32 (or _64).</span></li>
<li class="c1 c0"><span>Content of @spec is checked with ./scons
run_spec_val_test_32 (or _64).</span></li>
<li class="c1 c0"><span>Content of @rdfa_output is checked with
./scons run_rdfa_targeted_tests_32 (or _64).<br>
Additionally these two targets check that RDFA validator determines
valid jump targets correctly by appending jump instruction leading
to each location in input code. How @hex section is split into
lines determines which jump targets are allowed (it is expected
that bytes corresponding to a single instruction occupy one line in
hex files; for superinstructions, line continuation mark
&lsquo;\\&rsquo; is used to disallow jump to the end of the marked
instruction).</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="c0"><span>All these test targets are run on
bots.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>If &lsquo;regenerate_golden=1&rsquo; option is
passed to scons with any of these targets, the content of the
section is replaced with the actual output of the corresponding
tool. It is helpful when tests are edited. Of course, each such
change have to be manually reviewed.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>TODO: when @rdfa_output and @spec disagree and
how to check for it.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Note: there is legacy stuff in
validator_x86/testdata.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>How to</span> <span>run</span><span>&nbsp;all
these tests:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&nbsp; ./scons small_tests</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>(or, more specifically,</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&nbsp; ./scons run_dis_section_test_32
run_rdfa_targeted_tests_32 run_spec_val_test_32</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>and same for 64)</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c3"><a class="c8" href=
"https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3154">https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3154</a></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>The primary purpose of this test is to find
errors in our instruction definition files.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We enumerate all instruction sequences accepted
by decoder automaton and compare output of our decoder with
specific version of objdump.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>We do not enumerate all possible values of
immediates (there are too many of them). Transitions corresponding
to immediate bytes (as well as direct jump/call targets and
relative offsets - collectively &lsquo;anybytes&rsquo;) are marked
in the automaton, so we recognize them in our traversal and only
generate one representative instance of the immediate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Our decoder behaves differently than objdump
when it comes to fwait instruction (</span><span class=
"c3"><a class="c8" href=
"https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3251">https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3251</a></span><span>),
for example &lsquo;FWAIT; FNINIT&rsquo; sequence is decoded as
single &lsquo;FINIT&rsquo; instruction by objdump. We decide not to
reproduce this behavior and instead took precautions to ensure that
FWAIT instruction is always followed with NOP in the stream we
generate.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Also, RDFA decoder does not sign-extend
negative immediates (</span><span class="c3"><a class="c8" href=
"https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3164">https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3164</a></span><span>),
but it does not show up in this test because we use positive
numbers for &lsquo;anybytes&rsquo;.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>How to run:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&nbsp; ./scons dfacheckdecoder</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Since this test requires ragel, it can only be
run on linux. Also, it takes a while (about an hour on z620), so we
do not even attempt to run in on bots.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>There are ~250 millions 32-bit instructions and
~4 billions 64-bit instructions accepted by decoder.</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span class="c3"><a class="c8" href=
"https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3167">https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/issues/detail?id=3167</a></span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>This test is designed to catch following
problems:</span></p>
<ol class="c5" start="1">
<li class="c1 c0"><span>unexpected interactions between DFA actions
due to nondeterminism</span></li>
<li class="c1 c0"><span>mistakes in sandboxing logic in DFA
actions</span></li>
<li class="c1 c0"><span>wrong nacl-specific annotations in .def
files (for example, when one forgets to mark forbidden instruction
as nacl-forbidden)</span></li>
<li class="c1 c0"><span>typos and other errors in superinstructions
and special instructions that are manually specified in .rl files
(as opposed to .def files)</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>(requires ragel, platform=x86-64 (because of
python/validator integration) and old ncval built)</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Basically we are solving some kind of
&lsquo;</span><span>inverse kleeny star problem&rsquo;: given DFA,
we attempt to find such set of words, that any word is accepted by
this DFA iff it is a concatenation of words from this set. We do
not know how to solve this problem in general efficiently, so we
are using some algorithm which makes certain assumptions about DFA
structure (and verifies this assumption along the way).
Corresponding code lives in
validator_ragel/verify_validators_dfa.py.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>For technical reasons we subdivide all such
words into two categories: regular instructions and
superinstructions.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Superinstructions enumerated by
validator_ragel/verify_validators_dfa.py are checked in
validator_ragel/verify_superinstructions.py. For each byte sequence
we call objdump to make sure that it does not end mid-instruction.
Then we parse disassembly listing to determine whether it is indeed
valid superinstruction (since part of validation logic resides in
DFA action, some of the byte sequences accepted by automaton are
invalid from sandboxing point of view). And then we invoke
validator itself through python interface and check that it accepts
or rejects given byte sequence according to sandboxing rules. There
are less than dozen types of superinstructions and they are
relatively easy to parse (it is done in function
ValidateSuperinstruction32/64 in validator_ragel/spec.py), so we
don&rsquo;t bother to compare against the old validator for
simplicity.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Regular instructions are enumerated and checked
by validator_ragel/verify_regular_instructions.py. There are about
4M 32-bit instructions and 70M 64-bit instructions accepted by DFA,
so it is quite a costly test (about an hour on z620). For each
instruction, we call objdump to ensure that it&rsquo;s indeed a
single instruction. If text-based specification rejects this
instruction, we make sure RDFA validator rejects it as well. There
is no point for checks in other direction, because we ultimately
enumerate only byte sequences RDFA accepts (enumerating all
sequences would be impossible).</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Actually, this scheme works for 32-bit
validator. 64-bit one is additionally complicated by the fact that
information flows between instructions (in the form of current
restricted register). So we have to ensure that specification and
RDFA validator agree on instruction pre- and post-
conditions.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Also, just as in exhaustive decoder test, we
actually do not try all possible values for &lsquo;anybytes&rsquo;
(and direct jump targets fall into this category). Anyway, checking
jump targets logic is not the goal of this test (we rely on
manually written targeted tests for jumps instead).</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>How to run:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&nbsp; ./scons dfacheckvalidator
platform=x86-64</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>This test requires ragel and takes a lot of
time, so it can only be run on linux. It uses python interface to
validator (implemented as DSO), so supplied value of
&lsquo;platform&rsquo; parameter should match python bitness.
Additionally, since it uses both 32-bit and 64-bit ncvals,
following commands should be run before manually:</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&nbsp; ./scons ncval platform=x86-32</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>&nbsp; ./scons ncval platform=x86-64</span></p>
<p class="c0"><span>(this requirement can&rsquo;t be represented as
scons dependencies because these targets span across different
platform configurations)</span></p>
<h4 class="c0"><a name="h.6r4bpnhb7uz9" id=
"h.6r4bpnhb7uz9"></a><span>How do we apply text-based specification
to sequences of bytes?</span></h4>
<p class="c0"><span>Of course we could use objdump to get
disassembly, but that raises the question how reliable is objdump
in presence of invalid instructions (which is not its intended use
case)?</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Objdump is well-tested for the instructions
which make sense and which CPU accepts (each time someone adds the
instruction to gas it's added to objdump with the appropriate tests
and everything) but it's not all that good for incorrect
instructions (especially ones which are similar to other, existing,
instructions). E.g.:</span></p>

<p class="c0"><span>First three instructions are correct and
instructions after that point are minor modifications of the
existing instructions (extrq with register, not memory, vmovaps
with vex.pp changed from 00 to 10, and vcvtsi2ss with vex.pp
changed from 10 to 00). Objdump can declare instruction "(bad)", it
can detect that it's "(bad)" in the middle of instruction or can
just confuse it for different, real instruction!</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>Suppose for some reason DFA accepts completely
meaningless sequence of bytes, but objdump incorrectly decodes it
as innocent instruction, which text-based specification allows.
This situation is undesirable. That&rsquo;s why we use our own RDFA
decoder (which is tailored to mimic objdump output) instead of
objdump itself.</span></p>
<p class="c0 c2"></p>
<p class="c0"><span>RDFA decoder is designed to never accept
invalid instructions (it always produces the same
&lsquo;unrecognized instruction&rsquo; message where objdump might
try some guesswork). In order for decoding problem to go unnoticed
by exhaustive decoder test, RDFA decoder should accept invalid
sequence, objdump should accept the same invalid sequence, and they
both should produce identically incorrect output. So using RDFA
decoder in exhaustive validator test makes it extremely unlikely
that text-based specification would have to deal with incorrectly
decoded instruction.</span></p>
