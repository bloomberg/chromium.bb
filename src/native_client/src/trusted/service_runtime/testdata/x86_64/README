This directory contains two types of tests:

  1) Tests for elf file layout

  2) Tests copied from the scons staging directory.

  3) Death tests of an old ABI

The executables in this file only need to be changed when the ABI for one
of these two cases change.

The elf file layout are special (one-time) generated using
native_client/tools/generate_bad_x86_64_nexes.py, while in
this directory. If the pattern elf files change, these tests
need to be upgraded by manually editing the python file above.
Each generate specific error messages that are tested for
specific error messages.

The elf file tests are generated from

   fib_scalar_base.nexe

   TODO(karl): I don't know how this file was generated, and the contents of
   native_client/tools/generate_bad_x86_64_nexes.py depends on this executable.

The elf file tests are:

   data_not_last.nexe
   negative_hole.nexe
   rodata_data_overlap.nexe
   text_too_big.nexe
   integer_overflow_while_madvising.nexe
   text_overlaps_data.nexe
   text_overlaps_rodata.nexe

Note: The input fib_scalar_base.nexe is the input file for this
python script! DO NOT replace it!!!!

The scons staging test executables come from
   native_client/scons-out/nacl-x86-64/staging
The expectation is that there shouldn't be any validator errors etc. If this
no longer holds for an example executable, DO NOT submit until the corresponding
staging executable works. Then copy it over to this directory.

The staging tests (for sel_ldr) are:

   fib_array.nexe
   fib_scalar.nexe
   hello_world.nexe
   mandel.nexe
   nullptr.nexe

   TODO(karl): There isn't a script for copying these from the
   nacl-x86-64/staging directory. They were copied by hand. A script should
   be added.

Death tests of an old ABI are executables that no longer work, but did
in a previous API. Currently, the consist of:

   old_abi.nexe
