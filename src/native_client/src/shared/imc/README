Inter-Module Communication (IMC) Library.


The following steps are the typical way to setup a connection between
server and client processes:

1) The server creates a BoundSocket() on an address and waits for messages on
   it using ReceiveDatagram(), that expects a single handle passed in.
2) The client calls SocketPair() to create a pair of connected sockets, and
   calls SendDatagramTo() passing one end of the socket pair in the handle list
   to connect to the server.
3) The server uses the handle it received as the handle to the client
   connection.
4) Client and server can now communicate through the socket pair.
