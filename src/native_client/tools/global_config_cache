# This config file is a shell script which can be used to remap where autoconf
# stores cached information, such that even if the output directory is clobbered
# the cache can be retained. This is particularly helpful for cygwin, which
# takes a long time to generate configuration information.
#
# This file can be used by setting:
#   CONFIG_SITE=`pwd`/global_config_cache
#   GLOBAL_CONFIG_CACHE=/nacl_config_cache

# Handle /dev/null by assuming a local config.
