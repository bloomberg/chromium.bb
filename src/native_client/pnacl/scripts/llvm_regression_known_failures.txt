### Mac-only failures
###

# Failing only on the mac bot. I suspect it's just because the
# .macosx_version_min on that output has a 10 in it (i.e. it's not hermetic).
# TODO(dschuff): prove it.

### Windows-only failures

# For now we have both cygwin and msys failures in here.
# TODO(dschuff): once we switch to msys only, remove the cygwin failures.
# also run the script with --check-excludes (however some failures seem flaky on
# msys)
# These seem specific to cygwin
