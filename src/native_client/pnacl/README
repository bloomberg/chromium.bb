This file describes the directory layout of the PNaCl toolchain.

The most important thing is the user-facing toolchain programs, including
pnacl-clang, pnacl-clang++, pnacl-translate, etc. These are located in
the bin/ directory. The location (and existence) of everything else is subject
to change.

bin/
  User-facing PNaCl toolchain programs (pnacl-clang, pnacl-translate, etc;
  currently these are OS-specific wrapper scripts).
  Standard LLVM tools such as llvm-nm, opt etc**
  Nonstandard LLVM tools such as pnacl-llc**
  Standard GNU binutils ELF tools
include/
  Headers for linking against our build of LLVM**
lib/
  Host libraries used by our build of LLVM**
le32-nacl/
  Bitcode libraries and headers for building PNaCl modules
translator/
  Native NaCl object files and/or libraries linked into nexes after
  offline translation.

**These are not generally needed directly by developers of PNaCl modules
 in Chrome, but may be useful for others, e.g. those who want to build tools
 which target PNaCl as a platform

There are currently two different versions of the PNaCl toolchain: (1) the
legacy Python-based toolchain driver which uses the pnacl- prefix for the
individual tool names; and (2) the experimental native PNaCl Clang toolchain
driver which uses the le32-nacl- prefix.
