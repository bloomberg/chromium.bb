  # Modes specify a subset of packages to be used, this is a convenient way

  # Each mode has a list of packages associated with the mode. When you
  # specify "--mode mode_name" under package_version, it will only operate
  # on the list of packages specified under that mode.
  # For example, say normally "package_version sync" syncs packages 1,2,3,4 for
  # a platform. If you create a mode "evens_only" which only contains "2,4,6",
  # then "package_version --mode evens_only sync" will only sync packages "2,4".
  # (Notice 6 was not part of the original list of packages to sync so it is
  # ignored. This can happen if 6 would have been synced for another platform.)
