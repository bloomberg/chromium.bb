# These CTS tests currently fail when run with --enable-features=NetworkService,NetworkServiceInProcess
#
# Note: webview aims to support running network service in-process, so the
# tests are also running with NS IP. Multiprocess webview currently does not
# support running NS OOP, https://crbug.com/882650
#
# Note: the CTS test runner (run_cts.py) will implicitly skip "expected
# failures" (tests which are flaky or failing for the non-Network Service path
# too). These tests are listed in
# android_webview/tools/cts_config/webview_cts_gcs_path.json &
# android_webview/tools/cts_config/expected_failure_on_bot.json.

# Tests that fail with NetworkService feature enabled. https://crbug.com/923938
