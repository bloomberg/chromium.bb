# crbug.com/738611: Need to test all of WebUI with Polymer 1 while the migration
# is still ongoing.

# For practical reasons, we don't run all interactive_ui_tests with the
# WebUIPolymer2 flag disabled. Only the tests matching below are executed. It is
# possible that some tests that might be affected by the flag are not in the
# list below. If additional failures are found, add the affected tests to the
# list below, to prevent future regressions.
