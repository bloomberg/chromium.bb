# QUICHE

QUICHE (QUIC, Http/2, Etc) is Google's implementation of QUIC and related
protocols.  It powers Chromium as well as Google's QUIC servers and some other
projects.  QUICHE is only supported on little-endian platforms.

Code can be viewed in CodeSearch in Quiche and is imported into
[Chromium](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:net/third_party/quiche/src).
