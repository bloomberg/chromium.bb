# QUIC Crypto Test Data

This directory contains certificates and keys used for testing QUIC. Most of the
contents are generated by manual invocation of a script. The steps to
regnenerate everything are:

*   Build the ssl key encryptor: `blaze build
    //gfe/gfe2/ssl_cert_storage:ssl_key_encryptor`

*   Update the nonce (`nonce.txt`) to whatever stable value. If the nonce
    changes, the process of encrypting keys must be repeated.

*   Invoke the script: `go run generate.go`

Make sure to commit everything to Piper when done.
