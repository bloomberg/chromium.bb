// it doesn't read as much of the input string in the event that the string is
// not compressible by HuffmanEncode (i.e. when the encoding is longer than the
// original string, it stops reading the input string as soon as it knows that).

// Encode the plain text string |plain| with the Huffman encoding defined in
// the HPACK RFC, 7541.  |*huffman| does not have to be empty, it is cleared at
// the beginning of this function.  This allows reusing the same string object
// across multiple invocations.
