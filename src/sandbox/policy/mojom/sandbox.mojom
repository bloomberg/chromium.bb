// possible to host it in |kService|. These values are mapped to

  // On some platforms, may be slightly less locked down than |kService|.
  // For instance, it allows dynamic code and wider access to APIs on Windows.

  // Hosts the content decryption module. Allows pre-loading of CDM libraries.
  // - On Windows, when `CdmServiceBroker` is connected the CDM was not
  // sandboxed to allow CDM preloading.
  // - On Mac, the process is fully sandboxed when launched.
  // - On Linux/ChromeOS, the CDM is preloaded in the zygote sandbox.
