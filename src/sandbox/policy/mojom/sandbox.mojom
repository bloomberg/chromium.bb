module sandbox.mojom;

// Sandbox type that can be specified as an attribute of mojo interfaces.
// To specify the sandbox a service should be launched in, use the
// [ServiceSandbox=type] attribute.
// If your service does not need access to OS resources it should be
// possible to host it in |kService|. These values are mapped to
// //sandbox/policy/sandbox_type.h values.
enum Sandbox {
  // |kService| hosts 'computation only' services such as decoders that
  // use limited operating system services. Prefer to use this sandbox
  // if possible.
  kService,

  // Hosts generic utilities with limited access to system services.
  // On some platforms, may be slightly less locked down than |kService|.
  // For instance, it allows dynamic code and wider access to APIs on Windows.
  kUtility,

  // Hosts the content decryption module. Allows pre-loading of CDM libraries.
  // - On Windows, when `CdmServiceBroker` is connected the CDM was not
  // sandboxed to allow CDM preloading.
  // - On Mac, the process is fully sandboxed when launched.
  // - On Linux/ChromeOS, the CDM is preloaded in the zygote sandbox.
  kCdm,

  // Runs with the same rights as the browser. Usually needed to improve
  // stability by hosting code that interacts with third party code in another
  // process.
  kNoSandbox,

  // Hosts the GPU service and can talk to GPU drivers and other OS APIs which
  // may not be expecting untrusted input.
  kGpu,

  // Composits PDF and XPS documents.
  kPrintCompositor,

  // Like kUtility but allows loading of speech recognition libraries.
  kSpeechRecognition,

  // Equivalent to no sandbox on all non-Fuchsia platforms.
  // Minimally privileged sandbox on Fuchsia.
  [EnableIf=is_fuchsia]
  kVideoCapture,

  // Allows access to file contents and Windows APIs for parsing icons from PE
  // files.
  [EnableIf=is_win]
  kIconReader,

  // Allows LPAC capabilities for the Windws Media Foundation CDM, including
  // internet and private network access, COM, Identity & others. Allows access
  // to files in the `mediaFoundationCdmFiles` Chromium lpac.
  [EnableIf=is_win]
  kMediaFoundationCdm,

  // Launches elevated. Used by the RemovableStorageWriter.
  [EnableIf=is_win]
  kNoSandboxAndElevatedPrivileges,

  // Like kUtility, but patches GDI during child startup in pdf_child_init.
  [EnableIf=is_win]
  kPdfConversion,

  // |kXrCompositing| hosts XR Device Service on Windows.
  [EnableIf=is_win]
  kXrCompositing,

  // Hosts Input Method Editors.
  [EnableIf=is_chromeos_ash]
  kIme,

  // Text-to-speech.
  [EnableIf=is_chromeos_ash]
  kTts,

  // Hosts the Libassistant service on ChromeOS Ash, only used for
  // Chrome branded builds.
  [EnableIf=is_chromeos_ash]
  kLibassistant,

  // Like kUtility but allows access to IOSurface on macOS.
