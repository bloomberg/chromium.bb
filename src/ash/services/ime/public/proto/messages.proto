// Messages sent between the IME service and the shared library.

// IME service sends or receives messages via Mojo, it needs to convert the Mojo
// calls into protos before forwarding to and from the shared library:
//
//      [Chrome] <---Mojo---> [IME Service] <---Proto---> [Shared Library]

// private protocol, so Wrapper has fields for both. For the private messages,
// Wrapper stores it as a serialized proto to keep the message private.
