/**
 * @fileoverview
 * 'keyboard-key' provides a visual representation of a single key for the
 * 'keyboard-diagram' component. A single 'keyboard-key' can display one "main
 * glyph" and up to four "corner glyphs".
 *
 * The main glyph can be a text string (specified by 'main-glyph') or an icon
 * (specified by 'icon'). By default it is centered vertically and horizontally
 * on the key, and icons are scaled to fill the key while maintaining their
 * aspect ratio. The main glyph supports ellipsing text strings that don't fit
 * on the key, making it suitable for long labels such as "backspace" as well as
 * letter keys with single characters on them.
 *
 * Adding the 'left' or 'right' classes to the key will align the main glyph to
 * the left or right side respectively, and set icon widths to 24px.
 *
 * The four corner glyphs ('top-left-glyph', 'bottom-left-glyph', etc.) must be
 * text strings, generally single characters. If at least one of the right-side
 * glyphs is set, the corner glyphs will be arranged in the four quadrants of
 * the key like so:
 *
 * +---+
 * |a c|
 * |   |
 * |b d|
 * +---+
 *
 * If neither right-side glyph is set, the "left" glyphs will be centered
 * horizontally, like so:
 *
 * +---+
 * | a |
 * |   |
 * | b |
 * +---+
 *
 * Both a main glyph and one or more corner glyphs may be set, for example for
 * the 'e' key on a German keyboard, which has a centered main glyph but also a
 * Euro symbol in the bottom-right:
 *
 * +---+
 * |   |
 * | e |
 * |  â‚¬|
 * +---+
