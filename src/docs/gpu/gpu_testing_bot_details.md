# GPU Bot Details

This page describes in detail how the GPU bots are set up, which files affect
their configuration, and how to both modify their behavior and add new bots.

## Overview of the GPU bots' setup

Chromium's GPU bots, compared to the majority of the project's test machines,
are physical pieces of hardware. When end users run the Chrome browser, they
are almost surely running it on a physical piece of hardware with a real
graphics processor. There are some portions of the code base which simply can
not be exercised by running the browser in a virtual machine, or on a software
implementation of the underlying graphics libraries. The GPU bots were
developed and deployed in order to cover these code paths, and avoid
regressions that are otherwise inevitable in a project the size of the Chromium
browser.

The GPU bots are utilized on the [chromium.gpu] and [chromium.gpu.fyi]
waterfalls, and various tryservers, as described in [Using the GPU Bots].

[chromium.gpu]: https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/g/chromium.gpu/console
[chromium.gpu.fyi]: https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/g/chromium.gpu.fyi/console
[Using the GPU Bots]: gpu_testing.md#Using-the-GPU-Bots

All of the physical hardware for the bots lives in the Swarming pool, and most
of it in the chromium.tests.gpu Swarming pool. The waterfall bots are simply
virtual machines which spawn Swarming tasks with the appropriate tags to get
them to run on the desired GPU and operating system type. So, for example, the
[Win10 x64 Release (NVIDIA)] bot is actually a virtual machine which spawns all
of its jobs with the Swarming parameters:

[Win10 x64 Release (NVIDIA)]: https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/builders/ci/Win10%20x64%20Release%20%28NVIDIA%29

```json
{
    "gpu": "nvidia-quadro-p400-win10-stable",
    "os": "Windows-10",
    "pool": "chromium.tests.gpu"
}
```

Since the GPUs in the Swarming pool are mostly homogeneous, this is sufficient
to target the pool of Windows 10-like NVIDIA machines. (There are a few Windows
7-like NVIDIA bots in the pool, which necessitates the OS specifier.)

Details about the bots can be found on [chromium-swarm.appspot.com] and by
using `src/tools/swarming_client/swarming.py`, for example `swarming.py bots`.
If you are authenticated with @google.com credentials you will be able to make
queries of the bots and see, for example, which GPUs are available.

[chromium-swarm.appspot.com]: https://chromium-swarm.appspot.com/

The waterfall bots run tests on a single GPU type in order to make it easier to
see regressions or flakiness that affect only a certain type of GPU.
'Mac FYI GPU ASAN Release' is an exception, running both on Intel and AMD GPUs.

The tryservers like `win10_chromium_x64_rel_ng` which include GPU tests, on the other
hand, run tests on more than one GPU type. As of this writing, the Windows
tryservers ran tests on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs; the Mac tryservers ran tests on
Intel and NVIDIA GPUs. The way these tryservers' tests are specified is simply
by *mirroring* how one or more waterfall bots work. This is an inherent
property of the [`chromium_trybot` recipe][chromium_trybot.py], which was designed to eliminate
differences in behavior between the tryservers and waterfall bots. Since the
tryservers mirror waterfall bots, if the waterfall bot is working, the
tryserver must almost inherently be working as well.

[chromium_trybot.py]: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build/+/master/scripts/slave/recipes/chromium_trybot.py

There are some GPU configurations on the waterfall backed by only one machine,
or a very small number of machines in the Swarming pool. A few examples are:

<!-- XXX: update this list -->
*   [Mac Pro Release (AMD)](https://luci-milo.appspot.com/p/chromium/builders/luci.chromium.ci/Mac%20Pro%20FYI%20Release%20%28AMD%29)
*   [Linux Release (AMD R7 240)](https://luci-milo.appspot.com/p/chromium/builders/luci.chromium.ci/Linux%20FYI%20Release%20%28AMD%20R7%20240%29/)

There are a couple of reasons to continue to support running tests on a
specific machine: it might be too expensive to deploy the required multiple
copies of said hardware, or the configuration might not be reliable enough to
begin scaling it up.

## Adding a new isolated test to the bots

Adding a new test step to the bots requires that the test run via an isolate.
Isolates describe both the binary and data dependencies of an executable, and
are the underpinning of how the Swarming system works. See the [LUCI] documentation for
background on [Isolates] and [Swarming].

[LUCI]: https://github.com/luci/luci-py
[Isolates]: https://github.com/luci/luci-py/blob/master/appengine/isolate/doc/README.md
[Swarming]: https://github.com/luci/luci-py/blob/master/appengine/swarming/doc/README.md

### Adding a new isolate

1.  Define your target using the `template("test")` template in
    [`src/testing/test.gni`][testing/test.gni]. See `test("gl_tests")` in
    [`src/gpu/BUILD.gn`][gpu/BUILD.gn] for an example. For a more complex
    example which invokes a series of scripts which finally launches the
    browser, see `telemetry_gpu_integration_test` in [`chrome/test/BUILD.gn`][chrome/test/BUILD.gn].
2.  Add an entry to [`src/testing/buildbot/gn_isolate_map.pyl`][gn_isolate_map.pyl] that refers to
    your target. Find a similar target to yours in order to determine the
    `type`. The type is referenced in [`src/tools/mb/mb.py`][mb.py].

[testing/test.gni]:     https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/testing/test.gni
[gpu/BUILD.gn]:         https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/gpu/BUILD.gn
[chrome/test/BUILD.gn]: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/test/BUILD.gn
[gn_isolate_map.pyl]:   https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/testing/buildbot/gn_isolate_map.pyl
[mb.py]:                https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/tools/mb/mb.py

At this point you can build and upload your isolate to the isolate server.

See [Isolated Testing for SWEs] for the most up-to-date instructions. These
instructions are a copy which show how to run an isolate that's been uploaded
to the isolate server on your local machine rather than on Swarming.

[Isolated Testing for SWEs]: https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/isolated-testing/for-swes

If `cd`'d into `src/`:

1.  `./tools/mb/mb.py isolate //out/Release [target name]`
    *   For example: `./tools/mb/mb.py isolate //out/Release angle_end2end_tests`
1.  `python tools/swarming_client/isolate.py batcharchive -I https://isolateserver.appspot.com out/Release/[target name].isolated.gen.json`
    *   For example: `python tools/swarming_client/isolate.py batcharchive -I https://isolateserver.appspot.com out/Release/angle_end2end_tests.isolated.gen.json`
1.  This will write a hash to stdout. You can run it via:
    `python tools/swarming_client/run_isolated.py -I https://isolateserver.appspot.com -s [HASH] -- [any additional args for the isolate]`

See the section below on [isolate server credentials](#Isolate-server-credentials).

### Adding your new isolate to the tests that are run on the bots

See [Adding new steps to the GPU bots] for details on this process.

## Relevant files that control the operation of the GPU bots

In the [`tools/build`][tools/build] workspace:

*   `scripts/slave/recipe_modules/chromium_tests/`:
    *   [`chromium_gpu.py`][chromium_gpu.py] and
        [`chromium_gpu_fyi.py`][chromium_gpu_fyi.py] define the following for
        each builder and tester:
        *   How the workspace is checked out (e.g., this is where top-of-tree
            ANGLE is specified)
        *   The build configuration (e.g., this is where 32-bit vs. 64-bit is
            specified)
        *   Various gclient defines (like compiling in the hardware-accelerated
            video codecs, and enabling compilation of certain tests, like the
            dEQP tests, that can't be built on all of the Chromium builders)
        *   Note that the GN configuration of the bots is also controlled by
            [`mb_config.pyl`][mb_config.pyl] in the Chromium workspace; see below.
    *   [`trybots.py`][trybots.py] defines how try bots *mirror* one or more
        waterfall bots.
        *   The concept of try bots mirroring waterfall bots ensures there are
            no differences in behavior between the waterfall bots and the try
            bots. This helps ensure that a CL will not pass the commit queue
            and then break on the waterfall.
        *   This file defines the behavior of the following GPU-related try
            bots:
            *   `linux-rel`, `mac-rel`, `win10_chromium_x64_rel_ng` and
                `android-marshmallow-arm64-rel`, which run against every
                Chromium CL, and which mirror the behavior of bots on the
                chromium.gpu waterfall.
            *   The ANGLE try bots, which run against ANGLE CLs, and mirror the
                behavior of the chromium.gpu.fyi waterfall (including using
                top-of-tree ANGLE, and running additional tests not run by the
                regular Chromium try bots)
            *   The optional GPU try servers `linux_optional_gpu_tests_rel`,
                `mac_optional_gpu_tests_rel`, `win_optional_gpu_tests_rel` and
                `android_optional_gpu_tests_rel`, which are added automatically
                to CLs which modify a selected set of subdirectories and
                run some tests which can't be run on the regular Chromium try
                servers mainly due to lack of hardware capacity.
            *   Manual GPU trybots, starting with `gpu-try-` and `gpu-fyi-try-`
                prefixes, which can be added manually to CLs targeting a
                specific hardware configuration.

## Walkthroughs of various maintenance scenarios

This section describes various common scenarios that might arise when
maintaining the GPU bots, and how they'd be addressed.

### How to add a new test or an entire new step to the bots

This is described in [Adding new tests to the GPU bots].

[Adding new tests to the GPU bots]: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/gpu/gpu_testing.md#Adding-New-Tests-to-the-GPU-Bots

### How to set up new virtual machine instances

The tests use virtual machines to build binaries and to trigger tests on
physical hardware. VMs don't run any tests themselves. There are 3 types of
bots:

* Builders - these bots build test binaries, upload them to storage and trigger
  tester bots (see below). Builds must be done on the same OS on which the
  tests will run, except for Android tests, which are built on Linux.
* Testers - these bots trigger tests to execute in Swarming and merge results
  from multiple shards. 2-core Linux GCEs are sufficient for this task.
* Builder/testers - these are the combination of the above and have same OS
  constraints as builders. All trybots are of this type, while for CI bots
  it is optional.

The process is:

1. Follow [go/request-chrome-resources](go/request-chrome-resources) to get
   approval for the VMs. Use `GPU` project resource group.
   See this [example ticket](http://crbug.com/1012805).
   You'll need to determine how many VMs are required, which OSes, how many
   cores and in which swarming pools they will be (see below for different
   scenarios).
    * If setting up a new GPU hardware pool, some VMs will also be needed
      for manual trybots, usually 2 VMs as of this writing.
    * Additional action is needed for Mac VMs, the GPU resource owner will
      assign the bug to Labs to deploy them. See this
      [example ticket](http://crbug.com/964355).
1. Once GCE resource request is approved / Mac VMs are deployed, the VMs need
   to be added to the right Swarming pools in a CL in the
   [`infradata/config`][infradata/config] (Google internal) workspace.
    1. GCEs for Windows CI builders and builder/testers should be added to
       `luci-chromium-ci-win10-8` group in [`chromium.star`][chromium.star].
       [Example](https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/c/infradata/config/+/2077803).
    1. GCEs for Linux and Android CI builders and builder/testers should be added to
       one of `luci-chromium-ci-xenial-*-8` groups (but not `*ssd-8`) in
       [`chromium.star`][chromium.star].
       [Example](https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/c/infradata/config/+/2077803).
    1. VMs for Mac CI builders and builder/testers should be added to
       `gpu_ci_bots` group in [`gpu.star`][gpu.star].
       [Example](https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/c/infradata/config/+/1166889).
    1. GCEs for CI testers for all OSes should be added to
       `luci-chromium-ci-xenial-2` group in [`chromium.star`][chromium.star].
       [Example](https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/c/infradata/config/+/2016410).
    1. GCEs and VMs for CQ and optional CQ GPU trybots for should be added to
       a corresponding `gpu_try_bots` group in [`gpu.star`][gpu.star].
       [Example](https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/c/infradata/config/+/1561384).
       These trybots are "builderful", i.e. these GCEs can't be shared among
       different bots. This is done in order to limit the number of concurrent
       builds on these bots (until [crbug.com/949379](crbug.com/949379) is
       fixed) to prevent oversubscribing GPU hardware.
       `win_optional_gpu_tests_rel` is an exception, its GCEs come from
       `luci-chromium-try-win10-*-8` groups in
       [`chromium.star`][chromium.star], see
       [CL](https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/c/infradata/config/+/1708723).
       This can cause oversubscription to Windows GPU hardware, however,
       Chrome Infra insisted on making this bot builderless due to frequent
       interruptions they get from limiting the number of concurrent builds on
       it, see discussion in
       [CL](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1775098).
    1. GCEs and VMs for manual GPU trybots should be added to a corresponding
       pool in "Manually-triggered GPU trybots" in [`gpu.star`][gpu.star].
       If adding a new pool, it should also be added to
       [`pools.cfg`][pools.cfg].
       [Example](https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/c/infradata/config/+/2433332).
       This is a different mechanism to limit the load on GPU hardware,
       by having a small pool of GCEs which corresponds to some GPU hardware
       resource, and all trybots that target this GPU hardware compete for
       GCEs from this small pool.
    1. Run [`main.star`][main.star] to regenerate
       `configs/chromium-swarm/bots.cfg` and `configs/gce-provider/vms.cfg`.
       Double-check your work there.  
       Note that previously [`vms.cfg`][vms.cfg] had to be edited manually.
       Part of the difficulty was in choosing a zone. This should soon no
       longer be necessary per [crbug.com/942301](http://crbug.com/942301),
       but consult with the Chrome Infra team to find out which of the
       [zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/) has
       available capacity.
    1. Get this reviewed and landed. This step associates the VM or pool of VMs
       with the bot's name on the waterfall for "builderful" bots or increases
       swarmed pool capacity for "builderless" bots.  
       Note: CR+1 is not sticky in this repo, so you'll have to ping for
       re-review after every change, like rebase.

### How to add a new tester bot to the chromium.gpu.fyi waterfall

When deploying a new GPU configuration, it should be added to the
chromium.gpu.fyi waterfall first. The chromium.gpu waterfall should be reserved
for those GPUs which are tested on the commit queue. (Some of the bots violate
this rule – namely, the Debug bots – though we should strive to eliminate these
differences.) Once the new configuration is ready to be fully deployed on
tryservers, bots can be added to the chromium.gpu waterfall, and the tryservers
changed to mirror them.

In order to add Release and Debug waterfall bots for a new configuration,
experience has shown that at least 4 physical machines are needed in the
swarming pool. The reason is that the tests all run in parallel on the Swarming
cluster, so the load induced on the swarming bots is higher than it would be
if the tests were run strictly serially.

With these prerequisites, these are the steps to add a new (swarmed) tester bot.
(Actually, pair of bots -- Release and Debug. If deploying just one or the
other, ignore the other configuration.) These instructions assume that you are
reusing one of the existing builders, like [`GPU FYI Win Builder`][GPU FYI Win
Builder].

1.  Work with the Chrome Infrastructure Labs team to get the (minimum 4)
    physical machines added to the Swarming pool. Use
    [chromium-swarm.appspot.com] or `src/tools/swarming_client/swarming.py bots`
    to determine the PCI IDs of the GPUs in the bots. (These instructions will
    need to be updated for Android bots which don't have PCI buses.)

    1.  Make sure to add these new machines to the chromium.tests.gpu Swarming
        pool by creating a CL against [`gpu.star`][gpu.star] in the
        [`infradata/config`][infradata/config] (Google internal) workspace.
        Git configure your user.email to @google.com if necessary. Here is one
        [example CL](https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/913528)
        and a
        [second example](https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/1111456).

    1.  Run [`main.star`][main.star] to regenerate
        `configs/chromium-swarm/bots.cfg`. Double-check your work there.

1.  Allocate new virtual machines for the bots as described in [How to set up
    new virtual machine
    instances](#How-to-set-up-new-virtual-machine-instances).

1.  Create a CL in the Chromium workspace which does the following. Here's an
    [example CL](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1752291).
    1.  Adds the new machines to [`waterfalls.pyl`][waterfalls.pyl] directly or
        to [`mixins.pyl`][mixins.pyl], referencing the new mixin in
        [`waterfalls.pyl`][waterfalls.pyl].
        1.  The swarming dimensions are crucial. These must match the GPU and
            OS type of the physical hardware in the Swarming pool. This is what
            causes the VMs to spawn their tests on the correct hardware. Make
            sure to use the chromium.tests.gpu pool, and that the new machines
            were specifically added to that pool.
        1.  Make triply sure that there are no collisions between the new
            hardware you're adding and hardware already in the Swarming pool.
            For example, it used to be the case that all of the Windows NVIDIA
            bots ran the same OS version. Later, the Windows 8 flavor bots were
            added. In order to avoid accidentally running tests on Windows 8
            when Windows 7 was intended, the OS in the swarming dimensions of
            the Win7 bots had to be changed from `win` to
            `Windows-2008ServerR2-SP1` (the Win7-like flavor running in our
            data center). Similarly, the Win8 bots had to have a very precise
            OS description (`Windows-2012ServerR2-SP0`).
        1.  If you're deploying a new bot that's similar to another existing
            configuration, please search around in
            [`test_suite_exceptions.pyl`][test_suite_exceptions.pyl] for
            references to the other bot's name and see if your new bot needs
            to be added to any exclusion lists. For example, some of the tests
            don't run on certain Win bots because of missing OpenGL extensions.
        1.  Run [`generate_buildbot_json.py`][generate_buildbot_json.py] to
            regenerate `src/testing/buildbot/chromium.gpu.fyi.json`.
    1. Updates [`ci.star`][ci.star] and its related generated files
       [`cr-buildbucket.cfg`][cr-buildbucket.cfg],
       [`luci-scheduler.cfg`][luci-scheduler.cfg], and
       ['luci-milo.cfg`][luci-milo.cfg]:
        *   Use the appropriate definition for the type of the bot being added,
            for example, `ci.gpu_fyi_thin_tester()` should be used for all CI
            tester bots on GPU FYI waterfall.
        *   Make sure to set `triggered_by` property to the builder which
            triggers the testers (like `'GPU Win FYI Builder'`).
        *   Include a `ci.console_view_entry` for the builder's
            `console_view_entry` argument. Look at the short names and
            categories to try and come up with a reasonable organization.
    1.  Run `main.star` in [`src/infra/config`][src/infra/config] to update the
        generated files. Double-check your work there.
    1.  If you were adding a new builder, you would need to also add the new
        machine to [`src/tools/mb/mb_config.pyl`][mb_config.pyl] and
        [`src/tools/mb/mb_config_buckets.pyl`][mb_config_buckets.pyl].

1. After the Chromium-side CL lands it will take some time for all of
   the configuration changes to be picked up by the system. The bot
   will probably be in a red or purple state, claiming that it can't
   find its configuration. (It might also be in an "empty" state, not
   running any jobs at all.)

1. *After* the Chromium-side CL lands and the bot is on the console, create a CL
   in the [`tools/build`][tools/build] workspace which does the
   following. Here's an [example
   CL](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/1041145).
    1.  Adds the new bot to [`chromium_gpu_fyi.py`][chromium_gpu_fyi.py] in
        `scripts/slave/recipe_modules/chromium_tests/`. Make sure to set the
        `serialize_tests` property to `True`. This is specified for waterfall
        bots, but not trybots, and helps avoid overloading the physical
        hardware. Double-check the `BUILD_CONFIG` and `parent_buildername`
        properties for each. They must match the Release/Debug flavor of the
        builder, like `GPU FYI Win Builder` vs. `GPU FYI Win Builder (dbg)`.
    1.  Get this reviewed and landed. This step tells the Chromium recipe about
        the newly-deployed waterfall bot, so it knows which JSON file to load
        out of src/testing/buildbot and which entry to look at.
    1.  Sometimes it is necessary to retrain recipe expectations
        (`scripts/slave/recipes.py test train`). This is usually needed only
        if the bot adds untested code flow in a recipe, but it's something
        to watch out for if your CL fails presubmit for some reason.

1. Note that it is crucial that the bot be deployed before hooking it up in the
   tools/build workspace. In the new LUCI world, if the parent builder can't
   find its child testers to trigger, that's a hard error on the parent. This
   will cause the builders to fail. You can and should prepare the tools/build
   CL in advance, but make sure it doesn't land until the bot's on the console.

1. If the number of physical machines for the new bot permits, you should also
   add a manually-triggered trybot at the same time that the CI bot is added.
   This is described in [How to add a new manually-triggered trybot].

### How to start running tests on a new GPU type on an existing try bot

Let's say that you want to cause the `win10_chromium_x64_rel_ng` try bot to run
tests on CoolNewGPUType in addition to the types it currently runs (as of this
writing only NVIDIA). To do this:

1.  Make sure there is enough hardware capacity using the available tools to
    report utilization of the Swarming pool.
1.  Deploy Release and Debug testers on the `chromium.gpu` waterfall, following
    the instructions for the `chromium.gpu.fyi` waterfall above. Make sure
    the flakiness on the new bots is comparable to existing `chromium.gpu` bots
    before proceeding.
1.  Create a CL in the [`tools/build`][tools/build] workspace, adding the new
    Release tester to `win10_chromium_x64_rel_ng`'s `bot_ids` list
    in `scripts/slave/recipe_modules/chromium_tests/trybots.py`. Rerun
    `scripts/slave/recipes.py test train`.
1.  Once the above CL lands, the commit queue will **immediately** start
    running tests on the CoolNewGPUType configuration. Be vigilant and make
    sure that tryjobs are green. If they are red for any reason, revert the CL
    and figure out offline what went wrong.

### How to add a new manually-triggered trybot

Manually-triggered trybots are needed for investigating failures on a GPU type
which doesn't have a corresponding CQ trybot (due to lack of GPU resources).
Even for GPU types that have CQ trybots, it is convenient to have
manually-triggered trybots as well, since the CQ trybot often runs on more than
one GPU type, or some test suites which run on CI bot can be disabled on CQ
trybot (when the CQ bot mirrors a
[fake bot](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/gpu/gpu_testing_bot_details.md#how-to-add-a-new-try-bot-that-runs-a-subset-of-tests-or-extra-tests)).
Thus, all CI bots in `chromium.gpu` and `chromium.gpu.fyi` have corresponding
manually-triggered trybots, except a few which don't have enough hardware
to support it. A manually-triggered trybot should be added at the same time
a CI bot is added.

Here are the steps to set up a new trybot which runs tests just on one
particular GPU type. Let's consider that we are adding a manually-triggered
trybot for the Win7 NVIDIA GPUs in Release mode. We will call the new bot
`gpu-fyi-try-win7-nvidia-rel-64`.

1.  If there already exist some manually-triggered trybot which runs tests on
    the same group of machines (i.e. same GPU, OS and driver), the new trybot
    will have to share the VMs with it. Otherwise, create a new pool of VMs for
    the new hardware and allocate the VMs as described in
    [How to set up new virtual machine instances](#How-to-set-up-new-virtual-machine-instances),
    following the "Manually-triggered GPU trybots" instructions.

1.  Create a CL in the Chromium workspace which does the following. Here's a
    [reference CL](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2191276)
    exemplifying the new "GCE pool per GPU hardware pool" way.
    1.  Updates [`gpu.try.star`][gpu.try.star] and its related generated file
        [`cr-buildbucket.cfg`][cr-buildbucket.cfg]:
        *   Add the new trybot with the right `builder` define and VMs pool.
            For `gpu-fyi-try-win7-nvidia-rel-64` this would be
            `gpu_win_builder()` and `luci.chromium.gpu.win7.nvidia.try`.
    1.  Run `main.star` in [`src/infra/config`][src/infra/config] to update the
        generated files. Double-check your work there.
    1.  Adds the new trybot to [`src/tools/mb/mb_config.pyl`][mb_config.pyl]
        and [`src/tools/mb/mb_config_buckets.pyl`][mb_config_buckets.pyl].
        Use the same mixin as does the builder for the CI bot this trybot
        mirrors, in case of `gpu-fyi-try-win7-nvidia-rel-64` this is
        `GPU FYI Win x64 Builder` and thus `gpu_fyi_tests_release_trybot`.
    1.  Get this CL reviewed and landed.

1. Create a CL in the [`tools/build`][tools/build] workspace which does the
   following. Here's an [example
   CL](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/tools/build/+/1979113).

    1.  Adds the new trybot to a "Manually-triggered GPU trybots" section in
        `scripts/slave/recipe_modules/chromium_tests/trybots.py`. Create this
        section after the "Optional GPU bots" section for the appropriate
        tryserver (`tryserver.chromium.win`, `tryserver.chromium.mac`,
        `tryserver.chromium.linux`, `tryserver.chromium.android`). Have the bot
        mirror the appropriate waterfall bot; in this case, the buildername to
        mirror is `GPU FYI Win x64 Builder` and the tester is
        `Win7 FYI x64 Release (NVIDIA)`.
    1.  Get this reviewed and landed. This step tells the Chromium recipe about
        the newly-deployed trybot, so it knows which JSON file to load out of
        `src/testing/buildbot` and which entry to look at to understand which
        tests to run and on what physical hardware.
    1.  It may be necessary to retrain recipe expectations for
        [`tools/build`][tools/build] workspace CLs
        (`scripts/slave/recipes.py test train`). This shouldn't be necessary
        for just adding a manually triggered trybot, but it's something to
        watch out for if your CL fails presubmit for some reason.

At this point the new trybot should automatically show up in the
"Choose tryjobs" pop-up in the Gerrit UI, under the
`luci.chromium.try` heading, because it was deployed via LUCI. It
should be possible to send a CL to it.

(It should not be necessary to modify buildbucket.config as is
mentioned at the bottom of the "Choose tryjobs" pop-up. Contact the
chrome-infra team if this doesn't work as expected.)

### How to add a new try bot that runs a subset of tests or extra tests

Several projects (ANGLE, Dawn) run custom tests using the Chromium recipes. They
use try bot bot configs that run subsets of Chromium or additional slower tests
that can't be run on the main CQ.

These try bots are a little different because they mirror waterfall bots that
don't actually exist. The waterfall bots' specifications exist only to tell
these try bots which tests to run.

Let's say that you intended to add a new such custom try bot on Windows. Call it
`win-myproject-rel` for example. You will need to add a "fake" mirror bot for
each GPU family on which you want to run the tests. For a GPU type of
"CoolNewGPUType" in this example you could add a "fake" bot named "MyProject GPU
Win10 Release (CoolNewGPUType)".

1.  Allocate new virtual machines for the bots as described in
    [How to set up new virtual machine instances](#How-to-set-up-new-virtual-machine-instances).
1.  Make sure there is enough hardware capacity using the available tools to
    report utilization of the Swarming pool.
1.  Create a CL in the Chromium workspace the does the following. Here's an
    outdated [example CL](https://crrev.com/c/1554296).
    1.  Add your new bot (for example, "MyProject GPU Win10 Release
        (CoolNewGPUType)") to the chromium.gpu.fyi waterfall in
        [`waterfalls.pyl`][waterfalls.pyl].
    1.  Add your new bot to
        [`src/testing/buildbot/generate_buildbot_json.py`][generate_buildbot_json.py]
        in the list of `get_bots_that_do_not_actually_exist` section.
    1.  Re-run
        [`src/testing/buildbot/generate_buildbot_json.py`][generate_buildbot_json.py]
        to regenerate the JSON files.
    1.  Update [`scheduler-noop-jobs.star`][scheduler-noop-jobs.star] to
        include "MyProject GPU Win10 Release (CoolNewGPUType)".
    1.  Update [`try.star`][try.star] and desired consoles to include
        `win-myproject-rel`.
    1.  Run `main.star` in [`src/infra/config`][src/infra/config] to update the
        generated files: [`luci-milo.cfg`][luci-milo.cfg],
        [`luci-scheduler.cfg`][luci-scheduler.cfg],
        [`cr-buildbucket.cfg`][cr-buildbucket.cfg]. Double-check your work
        there.
    1.  Update [`src/tools/mb/mb_config.pyl`][mb_config.pyl] and
        [`src/tools/mb/mb_config_buckets.pyl`][mb_config_buckets.pyl]
        to include `win-myproject-rel`.
1. *After* the Chromium-side CL lands and the bot is on the console, create a CL
    in the [`tools/build`][tools/build] workspace which does the
    following. Here's an [example CL](https://crrev.com/c/1554272).
    1.  Adds "MyProject GPU Win10 Release
        (CoolNewGPUType)" to [`chromium_gpu_fyi.py`][chromium_gpu_fyi.py] in
        `scripts/slave/recipe_modules/chromium_tests/`. You can copy a similar
        step.
    1.  Adds `win-myproject-rel` to [`trybots.py`][trybots.py] in the same folder.
        This is where you associate "MyProject GPU Win10 Release
        (CoolNewGPUType)" with `win-myproject-rel`. See the sample CL for an example.
    1.  Get this reviewed and landed. This step tells the Chromium recipe about
        the newly-deployed waterfall bot, so it knows which JSON file to load
        out of `src/testing/buildbot` and which entry to look at.
1.  After your CLs land you should be able to find and run `win-myproject-rel` on CLs
    using Choose Trybots in Gerrit.

### How to test and deploy a driver and/or OS update

Let's say that you want to roll out an update to the graphics drivers or the OS
on one of the configurations like the Linux NVIDIA bots. In order to verify
that the new driver or OS won't destabilize Chromium's commit queue,
it's necessary to run the new driver or OS on one of the waterfalls for a day
or two to make sure the tests are reliably green before rolling out the driver
or OS update. To do this:

1.  Make sure that all of the current Swarming jobs for this OS and GPU
    configuration are targeted at the "stable" version of the driver and the OS
    in [`waterfalls.pyl`][waterfalls.pyl] and [`mixins.pyl`][mixins.pyl].
    Make sure that there are "named" stable versions of the driver and the OS
    there, which target the `_TARGETED_DRIVER_VERSIONS` and
    `_TARGETED_OS_VERSIONS` dictionaries in [`bot_config.py`][bot_config.py]
    (Google internal).
1.  File a `Build Infrastructure` bug, component `Infra>Labs`, to have ~4 of
    the physical machines already in the Swarming pool upgraded to the new
    version of the driver or the OS.
1.  If an "experimental" version of this bot doesn't yet exist, follow the
    instructions above for [How to add a new tester bot to the chromium.gpu.fyi
    waterfall](#How-to-add-a-new-tester-bot-to-the-chromium_gpu_fyi-waterfall)
    to deploy one.
1.  Have this experimental bot target the new version of the driver or the OS
    in [`waterfalls.pyl`][waterfalls.pyl] and [`mixins.pyl`][mixins.pyl].
    [Sample CL][sample driver cl].
1.  Hopefully, the new machine will pass the pixel tests. If it doesn't, then
    it'll be necessary to follow the instructions on
    [updating Gold baselines (step #4)][updating gold baselines].
1.  Watch the new machine for a day or two to make sure it's stable.
1.  When it is, update [`bot_config.py`][bot_config.py] (Google internal)
    to *add* a mapping between the new driver version and the "stable" version.
    For example:

    ```
    _TARGETED_DRIVER_VERSIONS = {
      # NVIDIA Quadro P400, Ubuntu Stable version
      '10de:1cb3-384.90': 'nvidia-quadro-p400-ubuntu-stable',
      # NVIDIA Quadro P400, new Ubuntu Stable version
      '10de:1cb3-410.78': 'nvidia-quadro-p400-ubuntu-stable',
      # ...
    }
    ```

    And/or a mapping between the new OS version and the "stable" version.
    For example:

    ```
    _TARGETED_OS_VERSIONS = {
      # Linux NVIDIA Quadro P400
      '10de:1cb3': {
        'Ubuntu-14.04': 'linux-nvidia-stable',
        'Ubuntu-19.04': 'linux-nvidia-stable',
      },
      # ...
    }
    ```

    The new driver or OS version should match the one just added for the
    experimental bot. Get this CL reviewed and landed.
    [Sample CL (Google internal)][sample targeted version cl].
1.  After it lands, ask the Chrome Infrastructure Labs team to roll out the
    driver update across all of the similarly configured bots in the swarming
    pool.
1.  If necessary, update pixel test expectations and remove the suppressions
    added above.
1.  Remove the old driver or OS version from [`bot_config.py`][bot_config.py],
    leaving the "stable" driver version pointing at the newly upgraded version.

Note that we leave the experimental bot in place. We could reclaim it, but it
seems worthwhile to continuously test the "next" version of graphics drivers as
well as the current stable ones.

## Credentials for various servers

Working with the GPU bots requires credentials to various services: the isolate
server, the swarming server, and cloud storage.

### Isolate server credentials

To upload and download isolates you must first authenticate to the isolate
server. From a Chromium checkout, run:

*   `./src/tools/swarming_client/auth.py login
    --service=https://isolateserver.appspot.com`

This will open a web browser to complete the authentication flow. A @google.com
email address is required in order to properly authenticate.

To test your authentication, find a hash for a recent isolate. Consult the
instructions on [Running Binaries from the Bots Locally] to find a random hash
from a target like `gl_tests`. Then run the following:

[Running Binaries from the Bots Locally]: https://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/gpu-testing#TOC-Running-Binaries-from-the-Bots-Locally

If authentication succeeded, this will silently download a file called
`delete_me` into the current working directory. If it failed, the script will
report multiple authentication errors. In this case, use the following command
to log out and then try again:

*   `./src/tools/swarming_client/auth.py logout
    --service=https://isolateserver.appspot.com`

### Swarming server credentials

The swarming server uses the same `auth.py` script as the isolate server. You
will need to authenticate if you want to manually download the results of
previous swarming jobs, trigger your own jobs, or run `swarming.py reproduce`
to re-run a remote job on your local workstation. Follow the instructions
above, replacing the service with `https://chromium-swarm.appspot.com`.

### Cloud storage credentials

Authentication to Google Cloud Storage is needed for a couple of reasons:
uploading pixel test results to the cloud, and potentially uploading and
downloading builds as well, at least in Debug mode. Use the copy of gsutil in
`depot_tools/third_party/gsutil/gsutil`, and follow the [Google Cloud Storage
instructions] to authenticate. You must use your @google.com email address and
be a member of the Chrome GPU team in order to receive read-write access to the
appropriate cloud storage buckets. Roughly:

1.  Run `gsutil config`
2.  Copy/paste the URL into your browser
3.  Log in with your @google.com account
4.  Allow the app to access the information it requests
5.  Copy-paste the resulting key back into your Terminal
6.  Press "enter" when prompted for a project-id (i.e., leave it empty)

At this point you should be able to write to the cloud storage bucket.

Navigate to
<https://console.developers.google.com/storage/chromium-gpu-archive> to view
the contents of the cloud storage bucket.
