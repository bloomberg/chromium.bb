## **Virtual Breakout Talk Best Practices - Google Meet**

We understand that there's a lot to consider when presenting and attending
virtual breakout talks. That's why we've curated the following best practices
for Google Meet.

### *Presenter Steps*

Before your breakout talk, please:

*   Ensure your backup presenter is available

    [Present your slides or pre-recorded
    talk](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9848723?hl=en&ref_topic=9545472)

        On the bottom, select Present now

        Select "Your entire screen," "A window," or "A tab"

            "A tab" is best for video and animation

        Select "Share"

            You (or your backup presenter) are responsible for presenting your
            slides or pre-recorded talk

    If applicable, [remove
    participants](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/7501121?hl=en&ref_topic=7290350#)

        \[External Attendees\] ask a Google participant to remove participants

        \[Internal Attendees\] select "Remove from meeting" in a participant's
        thumbnail image

During your breakout talk, you can moderate questions using any of the following
features

            participants to it, and it will be discoverable from the channel
            list in Slack

### *Google Meet*
