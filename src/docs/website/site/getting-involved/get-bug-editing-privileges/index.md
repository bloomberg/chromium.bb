## What are bug-editing privileges?

Anyone can file bugs and add comments to bugs, but some things—adding labels,
marking duplicates, changes status—require extra permissions.
There’s [plenty you can do to help with triage](/getting-involved/bug-triage)
without any extra permissions, but if you are doing a lot of triage you can be
even more effective if you can edit bugs. Just as with [becoming a
committer](/getting-involved/become-a-committer), however, these extra
permissions comes with an expectation of responsibility.

## How do I get bug-editing privileges?

***Note:** The instructions below are for someone who is getting involved
specifically through triage. If you need bug editing permissions for some other
reason, and someone on the Chromium team can vouch for you, that person should
nominate you directly via the committers@chromium.org list.*

First, spend at least a few weeks triaging bugs as described in the [triage
guidelines](/getting-involved/bug-triage), doing the parts that don't require
extra permissions and aiming to make significant contributions to at least 20-30
bugs. This is to demonstrate that you are committed to helping triage bugs, that
you understand the triage process, and that you can work with the rest of the
Chromium community.
Once you’ve done that, email a Chromium contributor who is familiar with your
triage work (for instance, a developer who has worked with some of the bugs you
have triaged) and ask them to review your triage contributions; include a
reference to this page since they may not be familiar with the process. They
should either provide feedback, or start the formal nomination process with the
committers list (if they aren't sure how to evaluate, or nominate, they can
email accounts@ to ask for help). As with becoming a committer, the final
decision will be made by the committers@chromium.org list.
A few things to keep in mind while you are getting started with triage, which
will help ensure that the nomination process goes smoothly:

*   Be polite in bugs. When you triage bugs, your comments will often be
            seen by bug reporters as representing the Chromium project.
*   Be professional. Again, your comments will be viewed in a different
            light when you have more privileges in the bug system. Don’t make
            disparaging comments about specific sites, browsers, people, etc.
*   Keep triaging separate from opinion. You may not agree with a
            feature request or a claim that a certain behavior is a bug, but as
            a triager your job is to get that bug routed to the right people to
            evaluate it, not to make a decision about whether it should be
            implemented.

Once your nomination is approved, you will receive a follow-up email with
instructions for enabling your new permissions.
