Have you ever wanted to edit a component's description, add cc-es, automatically
set labels, or even retire (deprecate) them? It's actually pretty simple, if you
know where to look.

1. Once you load up the issue tracker, click on the "Development process" link
on the top most menu.

2. Select "Components" from the sub-menu that appears.

3. Find your component from the current set of "Active components" (Pro tip:
There are a lot, so Ctrl+F is helpful).

4. Edit the component.

**Pro Tip:** "Deprecated" versus "Delete component". Both will remove the
component from auto-complete, however Delete will remove all references to the
component from any existing issues that might have it (e.g. if one were to
forget to query for "All issues" to migrate over fixed issues). Delete basically
has no "undo," in case a mistake is made. Given that errors happen, it's best
practice to use "Deprecated" over delete to afford a measure of recovery.
