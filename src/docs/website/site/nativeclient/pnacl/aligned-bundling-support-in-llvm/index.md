title: Aligned bundling support in LLVM
---

This document describes the proposal to add aligned instruction bundle support
(in short - "bundling") in LLVM and its implementation in the MC module.

[TOC]

## Specification

For the purpose of supporting the Software Fault Isolation (SFI) mechanisms
required by Native Client, the following directives are added to the LLVM
assembler:

```none
.bundle_align_mode <num>
```

```none
.bundle_lock <option>
```

```none
.bundle_unlock
```

With the following semantics:

When aligned instruction bundle mode ("bundling" in short) is enabled
(`.bundle_align_mode` was encountered with an argument &gt; 0, which is the
power of 2 to which the bundle size is equal), single instructions and groups of
instructions between `.bundle_lock` and `.bundle_unlock` directives cannot cross
a bundle boundary.

Furthermore, the `.bundle_lock` directive supports the `align_to_end `option,
which means that the group has to end at a bundle boundary.

For example, consider the following:

```none
.bundle_align_mode 4
mov1
mov2
mov3
```

Assuming that each of the `mov` instructions is 7 bytes long and `mov1` is
aligned to a 16-byte boundary, two bytes of NOP padding will be inserted between
`mov2` and `mov3` to make sure that `mov3` does not cross a 16-byte bundle
boundary.

A slightly modified example:

```none
.bundle_align_mode 4
mov1
.bundle_lock
mov2
mov3
.bundle_unlock
```

Here, since the bundle-locked sequence `mov2 mov3` cannot cross a bundle
boundary, 9 bytes of NOP padding will be inserted between `mov1` and `mov2`.
An example to demonstrate the `align_to_end` option:

```none
.bundle_align_mode 4
mov1
mov2
.bundle_lock align_to_end
mov3
mov4
.bundle_unlock
```

Normally, only two bytes of NOP padding would be required between `mov2` and
`mov3` to ensure that bundle-locked sequence does not cross a bundle boundary.
However, since `align_to_end` was provided, an additional two bytes of NOP
padding will be inserted so that the sequence ends at a boundary.

## Implementation in LLVM MC

As proposed, bundling is a feature of the assembler. Therefore, it is
implemented in the MC module of LLVM. Specifically, the following parts are
affected:

*   The assembler parser is modified to parse the new directives and
            emit appropriate commands to streamers.
*   The assembly streamer (used for printing out disassembly) is
            modified to emit textual directives back from streamer commands.
*   The object streamers are modified to act upon the bundling commands
            to affect the assembly process.
    *   Note: at this point support has only been added to the ELF
                object streamer. This is done to answer the immediate needs of
                NaCl and to reduce the complexity of the initial patch. At a
                later point, bundling support can also be added to the MachO and
                COFF streamers, if someone is interested.
*   The main assembler logic is modified to support bundling.

The following description will focus on the path: *Text assembly -&gt; ELF
object streamer -&gt; Assembly -&gt; Object file emission*. This path can be
roughly divided to three stages:

1.  Parse bundling directives and emit a sequence of sections
            (`MCSectionData`) and fragments (`MCFragment` derivatives) that
            represent the input.
2.  Perform layout of the fragments to be valid w.r.t. relaxation and
            bundling.
3.  Write the output object.

### Parsing and emitting sections and fragments

In order to implement bundling, we use the existing assembly parsing facilities
in MC, adding support for the new directives. The existing section and fragment
abstractions are used, with some flags added to keep the state of the bundling
directives encountered. Specifically:

*   A `BundleAlignSize` field is added to `MCAssembler`. When the`
            .bundle_align_mode` directive is parsed, this field is populated
            with the bundle alignment size (2 to the power of the argument of
            `.bundle_align_mode`). Setting this field is currently allowed once
            per assembly file. Subsequent `.bundle_align_mode` directives will
            be rejected as errors.
*   The following state fields are added to MCSectionData and managed by
            the code parsing `.bundle_lock` and `.bundle_unlock`:
    *   `BundleLockState`: keeps track of whether the currently parsed
                code is in a bundle-locked group (between` .bundle_lock` and`
                .bundle_unlock` directives) and whether the group has to be
                aligned to bundle end.
    *   `BundleGroupBeforeFirstInst`: keeps track of whether the next
                instruction parsed will be the first in a bundle-locked group.
        *   Turned on when `.bundle_lock` is encountered
        *   Turned off when an instruction is emitted in the streamer

When bundling mode is turned on in the assembler (`BundleAlignSize` &gt; 0), the
following rules apply to emitting fragments:

*   All instructions are emitted into separate fragments (either data or
            instruction fragments, depending on whether they are candidates for
            relaxation). This is essential because each instruction may
            potentially need to be padded to obey bundling rules when layout is
            performed (details below). Bundling does not apply to
            non-instructions like data, alignment directives, etc.
*   Instructions in bundle-locked groups get emitted into the same data
            fragment, since they are all part of the same group which has to be
            moved and padded together.
    *   To make this possible, all potentially relaxable instructions
                inside bundle-locked groups are relaxed before emission, so that
                they won't need relaxation in the future.
    *   While in theory the above means the code can become larger than
                necessary, in practice instructions actually requiring
                relaxation won't usually appear in bundle-locked groups, so the
                practical cost is very low. The gain is a significant
                simplification of the implementation.

### Laying out fragments

Bundling blends well into the existing layout mechanism in the MC assembler,
since its effects are somewhat similar to relaxation. Some fragments may need to
grow due to padding, which may require re-layout of subsequent fragments and
recomputation of fixups. Therefore, the MC assembler employs an iterative layout
algorithm. The following diagram will help explain the layout of fragments
w.r.t. bundling:

[<img alt="image"

*   When layout on a fragment is performed, the fragment's offset and
            size are computed.
*   The following steps apply only if:
    *   Bundling is enabled
    *   The fragment contains instructions (we don't pad data and
                alignment fragments)
        *   For this purpose, a boolean predicate `hasInstructions` is
                    added to `MCFragment`
*   If it's determined that the fragment will cross a bundle boundary,
            padding is required.
    *   The required amount of padding is computed and stored in the
                `BundlePudding` field of the fragment.
        This field is restricted to `uint8_t`, in order to save space in the
        mainstream case (bundling disabled). In practice, fragments of larger
        size will not be encountered (bundling is done at most on small groups
        of a few instructions).
    *   The fragment offset is set to point after the padding, at the
                start of the actual fragment. This way the following invariant
                still holds:
        `fragment offset + fragment size = offset of next fragment`
*   Padding is also required if the `align_to_end` option is provided to
            a bundle-locked group.

Note that since we create a single data fragment for a bundle-locked group, the
above applies to such groups as well as single instructions.

### Writing fragments to the object file

*Note: the write target of the assembler is abstracted into a stream object,
which can also write into memory. "Object file" here implies this stream.*

In the last step, the assembler writes the list of fragments into sections
according to their layout order. In this step, the `BundlePadding` field created
during layout is used to add NOP padding (by calling `writeNopData` on the
target-specific assembler backend) of appropriate size before fragments that
require it.

## Performance impacts

It's interesting to study the performance impact of adding the bundling feature
on MC's assembler normal operation (without actual bundling directives).

### Memory consumption of fragment objects

Amount of bytes needed for the various MCFragment objects on x86-64:

<table>
<tr>
<td> <b>Fragment type</b></td>
<td><b> Without bundling</b></td>
<td><b> With bundling</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>`MCFragment`</td>
<td>` 64`</td>
<td>` 64`</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>`MCRelaxableFragment`</td>
<td>` 320`</td>
<td>` 320`</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>`MCDataFragment`</td>
<td>` 240`</td>
<td>` 240`</td>
</tr>
</table>

Explanation: the single-byte` BundlePadding` field in `MCEncodedFragment` was
placed in space reserved for alignment earlier. The same was done for the
boolean `HasInstructions` in `MCDataFragment`.

### Assembler runtime

`llvm-mc` was run on a large assembly file (produced by compiling gcc 3.5 into a
single assembly file) as follows:

```none
sudo nice -n -20 perf stat -r 10 llvm-mc -filetype=obj gcc.s -o gcc.o
```

There were no noticeable difference in the runtime of `llvm-mc` with and without
the bundling patch.

**Alternative implementation**

Bundling is similar to relaxation in many aspects which simplifies the
implementation. While the performance impact of bundling is negligible as shown,
the interaction of these two mechanisms can have a negative effect on memory
consumption. When bundling is used, most instructions need to be put in their
own fragment. That's because before we have decided the sizes of jumps, we don’t
know the relative positions of other instructions, as we might need to insert
bundle padding NOPs between them. The only exception are bundle-locked
superinstruction sequences which can be stored in a single fragment.

Since there's a memory overhead for storing a fragment, the use of bundling with
relaxation significantly increases memory overhead. When translating pexe,
pnacl-llc uses *K \* nexe size* memory. The experimental results show that the
value of K is ~17 with the fixed cost of ~50MB. Given that, with the maximum
*pexe* size limited currently to 64MB, pnacl-llc would need over 1.1GB of
address space which is significantly more than 768MB that will be available when
pnacl-llc starts using IRT.

Therefore, one way to reduce the memory consumption is to disable jump
relaxation. In that case, we know that size of all instructions from the
beginning and we can write the bundle padding NOPs directly into the fragments
while emitting the instructions, thus reducing the number of fragments needed.

### Emitting instructions

We have implemented the alternative bundle padding scheme in LLVM MC. Currently,
this implementation is only being used when the -mc-relax-all flag is used. The
large bulk of implementation is in the MCELFStreamer::mergeFragment method. We
reuse the existing code and emit instructions into their own fragment. We also
reuse the existing logic for calculating bundle boundaries and necessary bundle
padding. However, when the jump relaxation is disabled, instead of adding each
fragment into the list of fragments held by MCSectionData, we merge it with the
current fragment.
