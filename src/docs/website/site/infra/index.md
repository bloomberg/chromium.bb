Infrastructure ('infra') refers to all of the servers and tools which the
Chromium project depends on for development.

Most of these are maintained at Google by a dedicated team, but (almost) all of
these are modifiable by anyone in the Chromium project.

To check out (most) of the Chromium Infra code use:

```none
fetch infra
```

Join [infra-dev@chromium.org](mailto:infra-dev@chromium.org) for discussion of
Chromium infrastructure related issues.

Most of the documentation is now at:
<https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/HEAD/doc/index.md>.

Google employees can also find more information at the [internal Chrome
