## For Web Developers

## What is service worker?

See the [service
worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)
documentation at Mozilla Developer Network.

### Debugging

Working with a service worker is a little different than normal debugging. Check
out [Service Worker Debugging](/blink/serviceworker/service-worker-faq) for
details.

## Track Status

Service workers shipped in Chrome 40 (which was promoted to stable channel in
January 2015).

[Is Service Worker
Ready?](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/) tracks the
implementation status of service worker at a fine-grained, feature-by-feature
level in many popular browsers.

### File Bugs

Go to <http://crbug.com/new> and include "service worker" in the summary. You
should get a response from an engineer in about one week.

If the browser **crashed** while you were doing Service Worker development, go
to chrome://crashes and cut and paste the Crash ID into the bug report. This
kind of bug report is very valuable to us. (If you do not see crashes in
chrome://crashes it may be because you chose not to send usage statistics and
crash reports to Google. You can change this option in chrome://settings .)

To give feedback about service worker that is not specific to Chromium, use
W3C's [public-webapps mailing
list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/). Use [the spec issue
tracker](https://github.com/slightlyoff/ServiceWorker) to file bugs against the
service worker spec.

### Discuss
