title: Slimming Paint (a.k.a. Redesigning Painting and Compositing)
---

## Slimming Paint is a [Paint team](/teams/paint-team) project to re-implement the Blink&lt;-&gt;cc picture recording API to work in terms of a global display list rather than a tree of cc::Layers (~aka GraphicsLayer in Blink terminology). It will result in a drastic simplification of the way that composited layers are represented in Blink and cc, which in turn will yield improved performance, correctness and flexibility.

To get a sense of the extent of this rewrite, one side-effect will be the
deletion of the code in core/rendering/compositing/.

## Phases

SlimmingPaintV1 - paint using display items ([Status: launched in
M45](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!searchin/blink-dev/slimming$20paint/blink-dev/qq4NEaqSrKM/OKiNzm3PkSkJ))

SlimmingPaintInvalidation - rewrite of paint invalidation using display items,
property trees introduced in blink ([Status: launched in
M58](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!searchin/blink-dev/slimming$20paint/blink-dev/YXcuTl6PbDk/7jAte1CDBAAJ))

SlimmingPaintV175 - uses property trees for painting in blink, introduces paint
chunks, uses paint chunks for raster invalidation ([Status: launched in
M67](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=771643))

[BlinkGenPropertyTrees](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17GKr2uIH2O5GthdTyvJpv1qZjoHYoLgrzvCkbCHoID4/view#)
- sends a layer list instead of a tree, and generates final property trees in
blink instead of re-generating them in cc ([Status: launched in
M75](https://crbug.com/836884))

[CompositeAfterPaint](https://docs.google.com/document/d/114ie7KJY3e850ZmGh4YfNq8Vq10jGrunZJpaG6trWsQ/edit)
- compositing decisions made after paint.
