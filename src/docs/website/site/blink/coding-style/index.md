title: Blink Coding Style Guidelines
---

These guidelines are specific to the [Blink](/blink) project, not to be confused
with the general [Chromium coding
style](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/styleguide/styleguide.md).

[TOC]

## C++

This documentation has moved to the [Blink C++ Style
Guide](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/styleguide/c++/blink-c++.md).

## Python

This documentation has moved to the [Blink Python Style
Guide](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/styleguide/python/blink-python.md).

## Web tests

See [Writing Web
Tests](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/testing/writing_web_tests.md).

## License

Existing files in Blink use a longer header license block inherited from WebKit,
however new files should follow the Chromium [File Header
Style](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/styleguide/c++/c++.md#File-headers).

To use this license block you must make sure you have completed the [External
Contributor
Checklist](/developers/contributing-code/external-contributor-checklist).
