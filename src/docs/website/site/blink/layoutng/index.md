LayoutNG is a new layout engine for Chromium that has been designed for the
needs of modern scalable web applications. It was released in Chrome 77.

It provides improved performance isolation, better support for scripts other
than Latin, and fixes many issues around floats and margins. It also fixes a
large number of web compatibility issues.

Please note that LayoutNG will be launched in stages. In Chrome 77 LayoutNG is
used for inline and block layout. Other layout primitives (such as table,
flexbox, grid, and block fragmentation) will be replaced in subsequent releases.

# Developer Visible Changes

Although the user visible impact should be minimal, LayoutNG changes some
behavior in very subtle ways, fixes hundreds of tests, and improves
compatibility with other browsers. Despite our best efforts, it is likely that
this will cause some sites and applications to render or behave slightly
differently. \[[CRBug
query](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?colspec=ID%20Pri%20M%20Stars%20ReleaseBlock%20Component%20Status%20Owner%20Summary%20OS%20Modified&q=Type%3DBug-Regression%20Label%3ALayoutNG&can=1)\]

The performance characteristics are also quite different; although performance
on a whole is similar or slightly better than before, certain use cases are
likely to see performance improvements, while others are expected to regress
somewhat, at least short-term.

## Floats

LayoutNG reimplements support for floating elements (float: left and float:
right) fixing a number of correctness issues around placement of floats in
relation to other content.

### Superimposed Content

The legacy float implementation didn’t correctly account for margins when
placing content around a floating element, resulting in the content partially or
fully overlapping the float itself. The most common manifestation of this bug is
when positioning images besides paragraphs of text where the avoidance logic
fails to account for the height of a line ([issue
861540](https://crbug.com/861540)).

<img alt="image" src="/blink/layoutng/legacy_float_margin.png">

*Fig 1a, Legacy layout.*
*Text overlaps the floating image to the right.*

<img alt="image" src="/blink/layoutng/ng_float_margin.png">

*Fig 1b, LayoutNG.*
floating image* *Text is positioned beside the
to the right.*

The same problem may occur within a single line. The example below shows a block
element with a negative margin following a floating element ([issue
895962](https://crbug.com/895962)). The text should not overlap with the float.

<img alt="image" src="/blink/layoutng/legacy_float_overlap.png">

*Fig 2a, Legacy layout.*
*Text overlaps the floating orange element.*

<img alt="image" src="/blink/layoutng/ng_float_overlap.png">

*Fig 2b, LayoutNG.*
*Text is positioned beside the floating orange element.*

### Formatting Context Positioning

When an element forming a block formatting context is sized next to floats
Chromium would try size the block a fixed number of times before giving up. This
resulted in unpredictable and unstable behavior and didn't match other
implementations. In LayoutNG all floats are taken into account when sizing the
block ([issue 548033](https://crbug.com/548033)).

Absolute/fixed positioning has been reimplemented and is more spec compliant
than the old implementation. It also better matches the behavior in other
browsers. The differences between the two are most visible in the areas where
the old implementation did not follow the spec:

*   **Multi-line Inline Containing Blocks:** If an abspos containing
            block spanned multiple lines, the legacy engine might incorrectly
            use only a subset of the lines to compute the containing block
            bounds.
*   **Writing Modes:** The legacy engine had many problems placing out
            of flow elements to default position in vertical writing modes. See
            the next section for more details around improved writing mode
            support.

## RTL & Writing Modes

LayoutNG was designed from the ground up to support vertical writing modes and
bi-directional content. This fixes numerous issues around both writing modes,
right-to-left inlines, and orthogonal flows.

### Bidirectional Text

LayoutNG supports the most up-to-date Unicode bidirectional algorithm defined by
The Unicode Standard. Not only does it fix various cases where rendering was not
correct, it also includes missing features in the old engine such as paired
bracket support ([issue 302469](https://crbug.com/302469)).

### Orthogonal Flows

LayoutNG improves vertical flow layout correctness, for more correct positioning
of absolute positioned objects, sizing of orthogonal flow boxes especially when
percent is used, and so forth. Among the 1,258 tests in W3C test suites, 103
tests that failed in the old engine pass in LayoutNG.

### Intrinsic Sizing

Intrinsic sizes are now calculated correctly when a LayoutNG block contains
children in an orthogonal writing mode.

## Text Layout & Line Breaking

The old layout engine in Chromium does text layout element-by-element and
line-by-line. This has historically worked well but requires a lot of extra
complexity to support complex scripts and to get good performance. It's also
prone to inconsistencies in measurements which tend to manifest themselves as
subtle differences in sizing of size-to-content containers and their content or
unnecessary line breaks.

In LayoutNG text layout is done on a paragraph level and is then split into
lines. This allows for better performance, higher quality text rendering, and
more consistent line breaking.The most notable differences here from a developer
and user standpoint are detailed below.

### Joining across Element Boundaries

In some scripts graphemes join with adjacent ones and changes presentation. In
LayoutNG this works even if the graphemes are in different elements, allowing
the joins to be preserved even if different styling is applied ([issue
6122](https://crbug.com/6122)).

The example below shows the rendering of the following HTML in legacy layout and
LayoutNG respectively:

&lt;div&gt;&#1606;&#1587;&#1602;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&#1606;&#1587;&lt;span&gt;&#1602;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<img alt="image" src="/blink/layoutng/legacy_shape.png">

*Fig 3a, Legacy layout.*
*Note how the form of the second letter changes.*

<img alt="image" src="/blink/layoutng/ng_shape.png">

*Fig 3b, LayoutNG.*
*Note how the form of the second letter is identical between the two.*

### CJK Ligatures

Although Chromium already supports ligatures and enable them by default, there
are some limitations. Ligatures involving multiple CJK codepoints are not
supported in the legacy engine due to a rendering optimization. LayoutNG removes
these restrictions and supports ligatures regardless of script.

The example below shows the rendering of three discretionary ligatures using the
Adobe SourceHanSansJP font.

<img alt="image" src="/blink/layoutng/legacy_dlig_jp.png">

*Fig 4a, Legacy layout.*
*MHz correctly forms a ligature but マンション and*
*10点 does not.*

<img alt="image" src="/blink/layoutng/ng_dlig_jp.png">

*Fig 4b, LayoutNG.*
*All three groups form ligatures as expected.*

### Size to Content

For elements that size to content (such as inline blocks) the current layout
engine computes the size of the block first and then performs layout on the
content. In some cases, such as when a font kerns aggressively, this may result
in a mismatch between the size of the content and the block. In LayoutNG this
failure mode has been eliminated as the block is sized based on the actual
content.

The example below shows a yellow block sized to content. It uses the Lato font
which uses kerning to adjust the spacing between T and -. The bounds of the
yellow box should match the bounds of the text.

<img alt="image" src="/blink/layoutng/kern_legacy.png">

*Fig 5a, Legacy layout.*
*Note the trailing whitespace after the last T.*

<img alt="image" src="/blink/layoutng/kern-ng.png">

*Fig 5b, LayoutNG.*
*Note how the left and right edges of the box match the bounds of the text.*

### Line Wrapping

Similar to the problem described above, if the content of a size-to-content
block is larger (wider) than the block, this can cause the content to wrap
unnecessarily. This is quite rare but sometimes happens for mixed-directionality
content.

<img alt="image" src="/blink/layoutng/legacy_ar_wrap.png">

*Fig 6a, Legacy layout.*
*Note the unnecessary line break and extra space on the right.*

<img alt="image" src="/blink/layoutng/ng_ar_wrap.png">

*Fig 6b, LayoutNG.*
*Note how the left and right edges of the box match the bounds of the text.*
