derive, are:

#### Promoting a useful and thriving web

We take action to improve the web over time to be more useful to users. This
primarily takes the form of shipping new features that web developers leverage.

#### Being a good user agent

users first, over web developers, over browser developers, over specification
authors, over theoretical purity.

#### Safeguarding the openness of the web

*   Based on an open, consensus-seeking standards process
*   Inclusive and diverse
