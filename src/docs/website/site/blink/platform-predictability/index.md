title: Web Platform Predictability
---

Web developers say a big problem building for the web is all the surprises they
hit where something doesn't work the way they expected. The Chromium project
(along with other browsers and standards organizations) has long invested
heavily in reducing these problems. But we've lacked a coordinated effort to
track and improve the whole area.

The Web Platform Predictability project is an effort to make developing for the
web more predictable, and as a result more enjoyable, cost-effective and
competitive with native mobile platforms. In particular, we intend to focus
primarily on problems caused by:

*   Different browsers / platforms behaving differently
            (interoperability)
*   Behavior changing from one version of a browser to another
            (compatibility)
*   APIs with surprising side effects or subtle behavior details
            (footguns)

## Advice for Blink developers

*   Blink's mission is to make the web better, fight the temptation to
            focus narrowly on just making Chrome great!
*   Prefer [web-platform-test changes in your
            CLs](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/docs/testing/web_platform_tests.md)
            over web_tests changes where practical
*   What matters to web developers is eliminating surprises, so focus on
            [pragmatic paths to
            interop](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LSuLWJDP02rlC9bOlidL6DzBV5kSkV5bW5Pled8HGC8/edit)
            that maximize web compat. If 3+ engines violate a spec in the same
            way, the bug is probably in the spec (especially when changing the
            engines would break websites). Specs are much easier to change than
            multiple implementations!
*   For breaking changes, reach out to
            platform-predictability@chromium.org for advice or read the [Blink
            principles of web compatibility](https://bit.ly/blink-compat)
*   Prioritize bugs in your areas that reflect real developer pain - eg.

            starred](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=component:Blink&sort=-stars&colspec=ID%20Stars%20Pri%20Status%20Component%20Opened%20Summary),
            [recent
            regressions](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=type%3Dbug-regression+pri%3D0%2C1+component%3Ablink+opened-after%3Atoday-60&colspec=ID+Pri+Mstone+ReleaseBlock+OS+Area+Feature+Status+Owner+Summary&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=tiles).
*   Understand how your feature behaves on [all major
            browsers](https://browserstack.com/), file bugs for differences (on
            specs, other engines and/or blink).
*   Make sure new APIs have feedback from several real world web
            developers.
*   Get to know your peers on other engines, you'll be surprised how
            well your goals and interests are aligned!
