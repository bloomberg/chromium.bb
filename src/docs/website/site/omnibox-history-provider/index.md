One of the autocomplete providers for the omnibox (the HistoryQuickProvider, HQP
for short) serves up autocomplete candidates from the profile's history
database. As the user starts typing into the omnibox, the HQP performs a search
in its index of significant historical visits for the term or terms which have

been typed. The resulting candidates are scored and a limited number of only the
most relevant matching URLs visited are presented to the user. For example,
imagine the user has visited drudgereport.com frequently and has started to type
'**dru**' in the omnibox. They will be presented with autocomplete suggestions
as shown in the screenshot to the right.
Substring matching is also performed. The drudgereport.com suggestion will also
be made if the user types '**rep**', though the

result will not be scored as highly and is likely not to be the top-most
suggestion, as shown in the screenshot on the left.
Multiple terms also work. drudgereport.com will be one of the top suggestions,
in this example, when the user types '**dr re**', '**re dr**', and similar
partial words.
The URL of the visited page is indexed and searched. As of Chrome 15, the page
title is also indexed and searched.

## Objectives

The HQP is intended to very quickly provide scored autocomplete suggestions from
a limited subset of all known historical URL visits. The specific objectives
are:

1.  Provide results in 20 ms or less.
2.  Provide the top 3 best matches for the terms typed by the user.
3.  Provide results as each character in the terms has been typed.
4.  Accommodate all browser supported languages.
5.  Consider only URLs:
    *   for which the URL was specifically typed into the omnibox OR
    *   which has been visited at least at least 4 times OR
    *   has been visited within the last 72 hours.
6.  Match against the URL and/or the page title.
7.  Match against partial strings.
8.  Match against one or more terms.
9.  Match against internal substrings (i.e. do not limit matches to
            start-of-string).
10. Provide results immediately upon browser startup.
11. Do not degrade startup and shutdown times.
12. Require reasonable memory resources.

## Approaches Considered

Three primary alternatives were considered:

1.  Perform queries against the history database as the user types
            search terms.
2.  Create a custom in-memory subset of the history database and perform
            queries against this custom database as the user types search terms.
3.  Create a custom in-memory index of the history database and perform
            queries against this index as the user types search terms.

Option #1 is far too slow and does not satisfy other requirements such as
partial string matches. Also, properly handling word-breaks for all languages is
extremely difficult.
Option #2 is much faster but still does not satisfy the language and partial
string match requirements.
Option #3 is more complex to implement but satisfies all requirements. Caching
of the in-memory data structures is required in order to meet startup/shutdown
requirements. Further, in order to minimize an impact from writing the cache at
shutdown and whenever updates to the index meant refreshing the cache a
simple-minded transaction log is required.
Within Option #3 are other considerations specifically as they relate to the
cache:

1.  During startup, the index must be built as quickly as possible (see
            Objectives 9 and 10). A cache helps satisfy these objectives.
            Unfortunately, in the absence of a cache a complete query of the
            history database must be performed in order to rebuild the IMUI;
            that database can be quite large, reaching tens of thousands of URL
            visits. Fortunately, a rebuild of the IMUI should rarely be
            necessary. The bulk of the pressure during startup will be the speed
            of loading the cache and repopulating the IMUI data structures.
2.  During shutdown, the IMUI must be cached as quickly as possible. On
            desktop systems, users are intolerant of an application taking more
            than a few milliseconds to shut down and get out of the way. A
            complete write of the IMUI data to the cache at shutdown may be
            quick enough to meet shutdown time requirements. If those
            requirement cannot be met, then an approach where the cache is
            constantly kept up-to-date may be required.
3.  During operation, it's important to keep the on-disk cache
            up-to-date in case the browser unexpectedly shuts down.

In summary, a cache will be required as well as some mechanism for keeping that
cache up-to-date as the user visits sites and as old, stale visits are removed
from the index.

## Components

There are two primary components to the history autocomplete provider: the
HistoryQuickProvider (HQP) and the InMemoryURLIndex (IMUI).

### HistoryQuickProvider

The HistoryQuickProvider, an AutocompleteProvider, is a client of the
InMemoryURLIndex. HQP, when asked for autocomplete candidates, marshalls the
search term (or terms) and asks the IMUI to provide scored and sorted matches
for that term (or terms). HQP then composes a list of AutocompleteMatches from
the IMUI results and notifies the autocomplete system that results are
available.
The design of the HQP follows the typical AutocompleteProvider pattern and is
not further discussed here.

### InMemoryURLIndex

All of the interesting stuff is in the IMUI. In essence, the text of the URL and
the page title for all qualified history items (URL visits from the history
database) are broken down into individual words and characters and inserted into
in-memory data structures with a reference to the original history item. Here is
a diagram of these data structures:

[<img alt="image" src="/omnibox-history-provider/HQP.jpg" height=266
width=320>](/omnibox-history-provider/HQP.jpg)

#### Indexing

During a build of the index, and whenever the user visits a site, the URL and
the page title for that visit are added to the index. Here's how it works:

For this example, let's use "http://www.americanentertainer.com/xj20gg1Z.html"
with a page title of "Recent Movies".

For each qualifying URL visit:

1.  Insert an entry into the **history_info_map_** for the **HistoryID**
            of the URL visit.
2.  The URL and page title are broken down into individual words:
    *   http www americanentertainer xj 20 gg 1 Z html recent movies
3.  For each word:
    1.  Append the word to the **word_list_** with the insertion index
                serving as the **WordID**.
    2.  Insert the word into the **word_map_** with its **WordID**.
    3.  Add the **HistoryID** for the URL visit to the **HistoryIDSet**
                of the **word_id_history_map_** item corresponding to the
                **WordID**, adding a new map entry if necessary.
    4.  Break the word down into a set of unique, individual characters.
    5.  For each character:
        1.  Add the **WordID** for the word containing the character to
                    the **WordIDSet** of the **char_word_map_** item
                    corresponding to the character, adding a new map entry if
                    necessary.

The **available_words_** list contains the **WordID**s for entries in the
**word_list_** which are no longer in use. This occurs when URL visits no longer
qualify for use by the HQP and one or more words of the URL or its page title
are no longer referenced by any of the indexed URL visits. Maintaining this list
prevents an ever growing **word_list_** (a poor-man's garbage collection).

#### Searching

The following diagram demonstrates what occurs in the HQP as the user types into
the omnibox. In this case, the user has type the four characters: **d r u d**.

[<img alt="image" src="/omnibox-history-provider/HQP%20Search.jpg" height=320
width=256>](/omnibox-history-provider/HQP%20Search.jpg)

Whatever the user types may constitute multiple search terms, either
deliberately or not. The following are examples of multiple search terms:
<table>
<tr>
<td><b>what's in the omnibox</b></td>
<td><b>how it's broken down</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> fox542steal</td>
<td> fox 542 steal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> amer spec</td>
<td> amer spec</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> google.com/search?source=ig&hl=en</td>
<td> google com source ig hl en</td>
</tr>
</table>
When multiple terms are present, each term is evaluated separately by the HQP
and the result sets are intersected immediately after the final union step shown
in the illustration. In order to meet omnibox typing responsiveness objectives,
should there be more than 500 result candidates at this point the scoring
operation is terminated and no results are suggested by the HQP. This is likely
to happen for very short search strings (i.e. for a search string of 'w' as that
will occur in most URLs being candidates). The results of that intersection are
then scored, reduced and sorted.

## To Do

#### Immediately

*   Update the threading model for cache file reading
*   Use SQLite as the caching mechanism.

#### Future

*   Record HQP statistics (qualifying visit count, size of cache and
            transaction files, etc.).
*   Validate the scoring algorithm through user feedback.
*   See if there is a way to offer in-line autocomplete results for
            multiple-term searches.
*   Determine if the full cache ought to be occasionally written,
            clearing the transaction file.
