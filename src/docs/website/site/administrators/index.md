This page describes the features and details of Chromiumâ€™s central management of
policies and preferences.

Chromium supports methods of managing the browser's behavior centrally, through
group policy, MCX files, and external configuration files. This gives you, as an
administrator, a way to manage the installations of Chromium-based browsers in
your organization.

These policies are strictly intended to be used to configure instances of Chrome
internal to your organization. Use of these policies outside of your
organization (for example, in a publicly distributed program) is considered
malware and will likely be labeled as malware by Google and anti-virus vendors.
