*   Google Chrome OS (Google Chrome OS) since version 26

Supported features:Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes, Per Profile: NoDescription:

Specifies the length of time without user input after which the screen is dimmed
when running on AC power.

When this policy is set to a value greater than zero, it specifies the length of
time that the user must remain idle before Google Chrome OS dims the screen.

When this policy is set to zero, Google Chrome OS does not dim the screen when
the user becomes idle.

When this policy is unset, a default length of time is used.

The policy value should be specified in milliseconds. Values are clamped to be
less than or equal the screen off delay (if set) and the idle delay.

Supported features:Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes, Per Profile: YesDescription:

This policy is deprecated, use ProxyMode instead.

Allows you to specify the proxy server used by Google Chrome and prevents users
from changing proxy settings.

This policy only takes effect if the ProxySettings policy has not been
specified.

If you choose to never use a proxy server and always connect directly, all other
options are ignored.

If you choose to use system proxy settings or auto detect the proxy server, all
other options are ignored.

If you choose manual proxy settings, you can specify further options in 'Address
or URL of proxy server', 'URL to a proxy .pac file' and 'Comma-separated list of
proxy bypass rules'. Only the HTTP proxy server with the highest priority is
available for ARC-apps.

For detailed examples, visit:
<https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-settings#TOC-Command-line-options-for-proxy-sett>.

If you enable this setting, Google Chrome ignores all proxy-related options
specified from the command line.

Leaving this policy not set will allow the users to choose the proxy settings on
their own.

*   0 = Never use a proxy
*   1 = Auto detect proxy settings
*   2 = Manually specify proxy settings
*   3 = Use system proxy settings

Note for Google Chrome OS devices supporting Android apps:

Supported features:Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes, Per Profile: YesDescription:

This policy is deprecated. Please use the DefaultPluginsSetting to control the
avalability of the Flash plugin and AlwaysOpenPdfExternally to control whether
the integrated PDF viewer should be used for opening PDF files.

Specifies a list of plugins that are disabled in Google Chrome and prevents
users from changing this setting.

The wildcard characters '\*' and '?' can be used to match sequences of arbitrary
characters. '\*' matches an arbitrary number of characters while '?' specifies
an optional single character, i.e. matches zero or one characters. The escape
character is '\\', so to match actual '\*', '?', or '\\' characters, you can put
a '\\' in front of them.

If you enable this setting, the specified list of plugins is never used in
Google Chrome. The plugins are marked as disabled in 'about:plugins' and users
cannot enable them.

Note that this policy can be overridden by EnabledPlugins and
DisabledPluginsExceptions.

If this policy is left not set the user can use any plugin installed on the
system except for hard-coded incompatible, outdated or dangerous plugins.

Supported features:Dynamic Policy Refresh: Yes, Per Profile: YesDescription:

This policy is deprecated. Please use the DefaultPluginsSetting to control the
avalability of the Flash plugin and AlwaysOpenPdfExternally to control whether
the integrated PDF viewer should be used for opening PDF files.

Specifies a list of plugins that user can enable or disable in Google Chrome.

The wildcard characters '\*' and '?' can be used to match sequences of arbitrary
characters. '\*' matches an arbitrary number of characters while '?' specifies
an optional single character, i.e. matches zero or one characters. The escape
character is '\\', so to match actual '\*', '?', or '\\' characters, you can put
a '\\' in front of them.

If you enable this setting, the specified list of plugins can be used in Google
Chrome. Users can enable or disable them in 'about:plugins', even if the plugin
also matches a pattern in DisabledPlugins. Users can also enable and disable
plugins that don't match any patterns in DisabledPlugins,
DisabledPluginsExceptions and EnabledPlugins.

This policy is meant to allow for strict plugin blacklisting where the
'DisabledPlugins' list contains wildcarded entries like disable all plugins '\*'
or disable all Java plugins '\*Java\*' but the administrator wishes to enable
some particular version like 'IcedTea Java 2.3'. This particular versions can be
specified in this policy.

Note that both the plugin name and the plugin's group name have to be exempted.
Each plugin group is shown in a separate section in about:plugins; each section
may have one or more plugins. For example, the "Shockwave Flash" plugin belongs
to the "Adobe Flash Player" group, and both names have to have a match in the
exceptions list if that plugin is to be exempted from the blacklist.

If this policy is left not set any plugin that matches the patterns in the
'DisabledPlugins' will be locked disabled and the user won't be able to enable
them.

should be enforced, installation of the Android YouTube app should be
disallowed.

### UnsafelyTreatInsecureOriginAsSecure (deprecated)

Origins or hostname patterns for which restrictions on insecure origins should
not applyData type:List of stringsWindows registry location for Windows
clients:Software\\Policies\\Google\\Chrome\\UnsafelyTreatInsecureOriginAsSecureMac/Linux
preference name:UnsafelyTreatInsecureOriginAsSecureSupported on:

*   Google Chrome (Linux, Mac, Windows) since version 65

Supported features:Dynamic Policy Refresh: No, Per Profile: NoDescription:

Deprecated in M69. Use OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin instead.

The policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such as
"\*.example.com") for which security restrictions on insecure origins will not
apply.

The intent is to allow organizations to allow origins for legacy applications
that cannot deploy TLS, or to set up a staging server for internal web
development so that their developers can test out features requiring secure
contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging server. This policy will
also prevent the origin from being labeled "Not Secure" in the omnibox.

Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the
command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a
comma-separated list of the same URLs. If the policy is set, it will override
the command-line flag.

This policy is deprecated in M69 in favor of
OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin. If both policies are present,
OverrideSecurityRestrictionsOnInsecureOrigin will override this policy.
