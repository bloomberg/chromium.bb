****UI under development. Designs are subject to change.****

**Chrome OS Notifications**

**[<img alt="image"
src="/user-experience/notifications/Notifications.png">](/user-experience/notifications/Notifications.png)**

**The notifications panel is used for all OS and website notifications**

Functionality:

*   Pops up along the bottom for any new notifications
*   Slides down after a delay
*   Can be closed to hide all notifications
*   Can be opened from the apps list
*   Sticky notifications (like the low battery notification) do not
            slide down unless the user clicks on the titlebar

Future goals

*   We may eventually anchor this panel in a special location on the
            screen, but for now it behaves as a standard panel, opening to the
            left of any existing panels.
*   Notifications should be able to badge application icons (like
            browser actions).
*   Better support for notification actions (links along the bottom).
