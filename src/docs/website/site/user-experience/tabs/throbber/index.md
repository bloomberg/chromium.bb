We use throbber in the favicon area of the tab to indicate that a page is
loading.

A single-state throbber could make Chromium feel slow because it would hide the
not-our-fault steps in the load process - it would lump DNS wait, server contact
wait, data transfer, and rendering into one animation blob. Server/network
slowness would therefore affect perception of Chromium's overall speed.
