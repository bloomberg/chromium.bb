## Overview

Chromium's history system keeps a full text index for each page the user visits,
making it easy to find pages based on their content, not just title and URL. The
user's history is exposed through the History page, accessible via the Tools
menu, or by pressing **Ctrl+H**. A user may also directly search their history
by typing a search query in the address bar, and selecting the **See all pages
in history containing \[query\]** item that appears if any results match the
entered query.

The History page surfaces the user's browsing history in two ways:

## Browse

When the user first enters the history page, they are in browse mode - a
condensed 'time, favicon, and title' view of their browsing history. Breaks are
inserted whenever there is a break in the user's browsing activity, and at day
intervals. Bookmarked pages are denoted by the presence of a star at the end of
the title.

## Search

If the user begins a search, the history view shows a list of search results,
presented by date, title, text snippet, and a thumbnail. Bookmarked pages are
listed first.
