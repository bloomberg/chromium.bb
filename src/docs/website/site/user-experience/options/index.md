## Introduction

By picking intelligent defaults, we hope that users never have to use the
options screen. In the event that they do, we hope that we have so few options
that managing and comprehending the whole set is easy. The options design was
left until late in the process so that the team would have to live with the
defaults.

## Sections

The options dialog is divided into three usage-based tabs - the majority of
users will only ever need the options in the **Basics** tab, a minority will
need the items in the **Minor Tweaks** tab, and very few will ever need to
examine **Under the Hood**. We had initially attempted content-based sections,
but that lead to confusion over where a given preference should exist, and mixed
useful and esoteric preferences together.

Over time, we hope to reduce the number of options further.
