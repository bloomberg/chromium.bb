## Design decisions: existing design

### Native style

While we're not a natively-themed application, we do wish to fit within the
operating system so that our app doesn't look out of place. This affects our
choices of:

*   interface icons (Vista makes frequent use of a certain back/forward
            icon style)
*   color
*   perceived depth, thickness
*   border shape, width and styling
*   font choice
*   blurriness - Windows tends to be more bitmappy than OS X, preferring
            to align everything along pixel boundaries - see the Cleartype vs.
            Quartz wars.

We use a non-native window frame with XP because the existing toolbar did not
support our tabs-on-top design - its color and gradients did not support the
overlay of interactive graphics, and it did not have the height we required. We
use the native frame on Vista, and intend to use the native frame on OS X.

The Windows XP UI consists of three layers - the first two consist of a blue
rubbery window frame, and a lighter tab frame. The buttons then stick out of
this frame, forming a third layer of depth. Each of these layers should each
feel no more than three or four pixels deep. We avoided going totally flat, as
this clashed with the host operating system and felt wrong - Chromium should
feel like a tactile object, not an abstract flat piece of software.

The Photoshop file used in the creation of the Chrome design can be found
attached at the bottom of this page.

#### Mathemagics

While the following is very rough because of gradual changes over time, rounding
errors, and because highlights and shadows make it hard to judge perceptual
distances, our design started based on the golden ratio. In the diagram above:
C = GR \* B
B = GR \* A
As the titlebar fills up with tabs, 'A' becomes the only grabbable area for the
window. This may prove to be too small for most users (user study results are
encouraging, however), so this may change.

#### Type

For all Chromium dialogs and toolbars, we use the system default font, which is
most frequently Tahoma 11px on Windows XP, or Segoe on Vista.
We make the URL larger (13px) to make it stand out more, and because the omnibox
is a large part of the product. This means that the baseline of the text in the
omnibox doesn't line up with the baselines of the text for the menus. Cry.

## Inspiration

While it doesn't show through today, we drew early inspiration from The
Designers Republic's work on the then-Psygnosis games WipEout and WipEout 2097;
the focus on blinding speed, and iconography that could be recognized instantly
even in the depths of your peripheral vision were both key attributes we
admired.

## Visual tests

All designs should be tested against default desktop backgrounds on XP and Vista
(with and without the default images), with multiple applications open
(typically multiple Windows Explorer windows and Office), at different screen
resolutions.
