Chromium's 'Find in Page' bar appears in the top-right of the content area, and
allows users to find text on the page. The find bar is presented as an overlay
in order to prevent page relayout when the bar is shown or hidden. If the text
the user is looking for is under the bar, it will scroll the page, or slide out
of the way.

There is currently no facility for users to use the find results to perform
actions on elements within the page.
