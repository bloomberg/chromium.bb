## Shelf

[<img alt="image"

The download shelf is a tab-parented toolbar that shows the downloads that have
occurred in its parent tab. The shelf allows us to show download UI without the
overhead of additional windows. Items in the shelf can be dragged to folders to
make it easier to organize files post-download; in future they will be able to
be dragged to upload fields.

## Browse

The user may see a full-sized view of their downloads by viewing the downloads
page, accessible from the Chromium menu, by pressing **Ctrl+J**, or by clicking
**Show all downloads** the right edge of a download shelf. This page shows a
searchable, more detailed list of the user's downloads.

## Future Work

We are considering making the shelf a per-window or global option; both of these
have problems in multi-window scenarios, however.
