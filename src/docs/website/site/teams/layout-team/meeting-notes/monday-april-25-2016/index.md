Tables (dgrogan)
- Table layout refactor, putting out fires with patch going to stable.

<https://crbug.com/178369> which are different but related issues.
mstensho has been consulting.
Text (eae, drott, kojii)
- Continued to work on font-variant-caps, blocked on rebaseline bot
being offline. (drott)
- font-variant property into a shorthand, CL up for review. (drott)
- Contributed to Koji's document on implementation/shipping plan for
hyphenation. (drott)
- Implemented font-variant property parsed as CSS shorthand (as opposed
to being a CSSPrimitive Value before), working well. Font-variant now
accepts font-variant-ligatures and font-variant-caps values, and
combines synthetic small caps with ligatures \\o/. Up for review.
(drott)
- Fixed bug where we sometimes omitted tab characters to due incorrect
rounding in LineWidth::snapUncommittedWidth. (eae)
