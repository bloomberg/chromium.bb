eae OOO, jsbell taking notes (poorly - apologies for mangling your words and
leaving out any important bits)

Measure API (jchaffraix)

- still working on proposal for measure

- finished layer refactor/renaming

Flexbox (cbiesinger)

- almost done w/ first part of flexbox spec change

- tests missing, importing w3c tests

Isolate core/fetch (japhet)

Rename Rendering -&gt; Layout (dsinclair)

- splitting layout name out into decorated name \[jsbell: didn't catch all of
this\]

- updating lots of layout tests to have more correct results

- renderer -&gt; layout object renaming

- fun content shell resize issue causing subsequent tests to fail, trying to
track it down

Line Boxes(hartmanng, szager)

- working through float to layout unit test failures

- hartmanng: windows - tons of failures, but everything so far looks like it can
rebased, but only a few dozen out of a few hundred reviewed so far

- szager: made it through nearly all tests on mac, two real regressions - line
wrapping, svg and platform specific layout; digging into those
