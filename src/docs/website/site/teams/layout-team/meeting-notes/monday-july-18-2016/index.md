audio, been meeting with the TOK team for worklets and will continue
that this week. (ikilpatrick)

layout team incorporated. Thanks for your help and input everyone!

issues blocking the work to separate style resolution from layout tree
construction. (dgrogan)
- Next up is adding support for visibility: collapse to table rows and
columns. (dgrogan)
Text (eae, drott, kojii)
- Complex text enabled by default on Android again (yay!), there are a
number of small regressions with regard to both performance and memory
but nothing like the big regressions we've seen in the past. Still
deciding on strategy. (drott)
- Merged font manager change corresponding regression fix to M53.
(drott)
- Next, planning to go back to looking at the glyphToBoundsMap removal -
there were still regressions in SVG tests that I need to figure out.
(drott)
- Meeting with Docs team tomorrow to discuss what could be done in
Chrome to improve Docs. (drott)
- Fixed a couple of crashes involving LayoutTextControl. (eae)
Misc:
- Fixed SVGLength crash. (eae)
- Up until now eae has been doing all bug triage for the layout team.
Now that the triage backlog is zero it's time to start a rotation
among all team members. Expect it to start next week and to involve
one week long stint as a triager every two months. (eae)
- Wrote up instructions for bug triage \[4\]. (eae)
Logistics:
- szager out for the next two weeks.
- mstensho out for the next month.
