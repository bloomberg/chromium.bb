Updates since last meeting (on Tuesday, March 15, 2016):
Scrolling (skobes)
- Working on patch to fix absolute positoined scroll anchors within
static positioned scrollers which is an interesting edge case.
- Smooth scrolling and scroll anchoring interaction is a bit problematic
and needs some work given the absolute scroll offsets that update
immediately.
- Work on speeding up smooth scrolling in response to user feedback.
CSS Flexbox (cbiesinger)
- Fixed percentage sizing, the last remaining major task.
- Almost all of the scrolling regressions (again!) still one case
remaining that needs more investigation.
CSS Grid Layout (svillar, jfernandez, rego, javif)
\[[crbug.com/79180](http://crbug.com/79180)\]
- eae/svillar trying to figure out what would be required to ship CSS Grid.
CSS Multi-column (mstensho) \[[crbug.com/334335](http://crbug.com/334335)\]
- The past weeks I've been working on the break-{after,before,inside}
properties. Mostly some preparatory patches so far, while I've kept
the beefy parts to myself for now.
- Also: continued cleaning up and untangled multicol stuff in
mapLocalToAncestor() and friends, which made it super-easy to fix some
a hot PaintLayer clipping bug afterwards.
