Updates since last meeting (on Monday, July 13th):

Scrolling (skobes, szager) \[[crbug.com/417782](http://crbug.com/417782)\]

- Continuing root layer scrolling conversion. Judging progress is hard

and we don't necessarily know how much work remains, plan is to turn

on root layer scrolling unconditionally and then run all he tests in

order to see how many test failures we have and then use that as a

burn-down list. Obviously progress isn't linear with the number of

test failures but should give us a rough idea and a way to track

progerss. (szager)

CSS Flexbox (cbiesinger) \[[crbug.com/426898](http://crbug.com/426898)\]

- Back from vacation, resuming flexbox work.

at the moment, looking into why and working on improving our
