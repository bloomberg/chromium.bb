Updates since last meeting (on Monday, April 4, 2016):
Scrolling
- Focus on root layer scrolling for now. The top most element, the
layout view, (frame view contains layout view, both are scrollable
areas. Frame view has special magic, plan is to have LayoutView handle
scrolls using the standard ScrollableContainer logic. Been ongoing for
awhile, skobes has done most of the work but has been pulled into
other things. (szager)
CSS Flexbox (cbiesinger)
- Spent way too much time on scrolling and will have to spent more time
on scrolling. Still haven't found a good solution, trying to move
scroll clamping to after the layout phase.
- Landed a few cleanup patches.
- Focus on other flexbox issues this week.
