Highlights

- New multicol implementation shipped!

- Line layout in layout units landing this week!

Updates since last meeting (on Monday, May 18th):

Performance Tracking (benjhayden)

- Continuing work on trace viewer.

Scrolling (skobes) \[crbug.com/417782\]

- Root layer scrolling broke &lt;body&gt; stretching to viewport in quirks

mode; fix is waiting on code review.

- Page scale factor is a bigger concern: page scaling changes

content size relative to scroll bounds, which doesn't work with root

layer scrolling as currently implemented. Need to teach LayoutView /

DPLScrollableArea how to apply the page scale factor, which could get

messy.

Line Boxes (szager) \[crbug.com/321237\]

- Ready to land, will require a ton of rebaselines.

Flexbox (cbiesinger) \[crbug.com/426898\]

- Discussions around absolut positioning within flexbox.

- Updated handling of min-width/min-height.

List marker refactoring (dsinclair) \[crbug.com/370461\]

- List marker patches in M44 branch. Yay!

Menu list refactoring (dsinclair) \[crbug.com/370462\]

- Menu list changes landed, with hack to use empty text node instead

of BR for line breaks to ensure proper alignment.

Fullscreen (dsinclair) \[crbug.com/370459\]

- Taking over work to update fullscreen implementation to not modify

layout tree during layout. Building on previous work by Julien and

James among others.
