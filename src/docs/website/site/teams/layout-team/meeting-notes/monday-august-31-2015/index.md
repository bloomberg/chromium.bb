Updates since last meeting (on Monday, August 24th):
Scrolling (skobes, szager) \[[crbug.com/417782](http://crbug.com/417782)\]
- Tracked down issue with scroll bounds change and determined that the
failing tests where due to a bug in the old implementation. New test
results are correct. Will require a rebaseline. (szager)
- Still having some problems with the flexbox scollbar change, need to
figure out why the fix is causing a perf regression. Happy with code
change and convinced the fix is correct and that the new behavior is
better. (szager)
