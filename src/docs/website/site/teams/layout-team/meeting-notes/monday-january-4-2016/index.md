Welcome back every, I hope you all had a good holiday break.
With a new year comes new goals. Before we can set the high-level 2016
goals and Q1 OKRs though we should reflect on where we are and evaluate
our Q4 progress.
I'll reach out to everyone individually over the next week or so to
start the OKR process and will schedule a team-wide OKR meeting in a
week or two. In the mean time please try to summarize and score your Q4
OKRs and start thinking about what you want to work on in Q1 and beyond.
