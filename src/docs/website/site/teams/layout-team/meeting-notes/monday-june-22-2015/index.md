Updates since last meeting (on Tuesday, June 16th):

Scrolling (skobes, szager) \[crbug.com/417782\]

- Fixed handling of overflow clip for root layer.

CSS Flexbox (cbiesinger) \[crbug.com/426898\]

investigation. Handling of form controls (like calendar picker) is

problematic.

CSS Grid Layout (svillar) \[crbug.com/79180\]

- Blocked on code reviews. (svillar)

Region-based multi-column support (mstensho) \[crbug.com/334335\]

print.

Add API for layout (leviw, pilgrim) \[crbug.com/495288\]

- Continuing work on adding API around block layout. Managed to track

down and solve the performance problems assoscaited with it (turns

out it was caused by the overhead of extra non-inlined constructors/

deconstructors). (pilgrim)

Isolate core/fetch (japhet) \[crbug.com/458222\]

- Continued work to separate core/fetch from core and considering finer

grained separation per resource type. I.e css resource handling

specific logic could be moved to the css directory.

Text (eae, drott, kojii)

- Removing dependency on glyph page tree node from complex path to allow

it to be removed entierly once the simple path is removed. Trying to

figure out exactly how it is used and where in order to break the

dependency. (drott)

- Unicode variation selectors support fixed for Win/Mac. Linux needs our

harfbuzz in unofficial builds. (kojii)

- Investigating bundling our harfbuzz for unofficial Linux. (kojii)

looks very good, will try to land this week. (eae)
