Updates since last meeting (on Tuesday, February 16th):
Scrolling (skobes)
- Fixed crashes caused by stale LayoutObject pointers in scroll anchor.
- Fixed an old bug in coordinated scrollbar where we hold stale
scrollbar pointers.
- Simplifications in paint layer scrollable area.
- Playing around with scroll anchoring on real world web sites.
- Discovered a new smooth scroll regression.
CSS Flexbox (cbiesinger)
- Finished up the scrolling fixes last week, at least I thought I did.
szager found another issue relating to nested flexboxes. Not quite
sure what the correct fix is, will require further work.
- More flexbox release blockers relating to overflow: auto.
- Imported Mozilla flexbox tests, pass the vast majority. One failure is
paint related and will probably fixed by slimming paint v2 (the
fundamental composting bug), a few fail due to lack of visibility
collapse support.
- Struggle with upstreaming tests to w3c continues, synced up with
fantasi and have a plan to move forward.

Covering gaps in the API where we are relying on implicit conversion.

- Started working on the Block Layout API. Trying to figure out the
hierarchy, still up in the air. (pilgrim)
- Hope to finish up Line Layout API and add include guard by the end of
