At Google we define and track progress against our goals using
["OKRs"](https://www.gv.com/lib/how-google-sets-goals-objectives-and-key-results-okrs)
(Objectives and Key Results). Here are most of the OKRs for the input-dev team
(a couple minor KRs relating to internal projects such as future Android
releases have been omitted for confidentiality reasons). Note that these are
**intentionally aggressive** and so we will be happy if we deliver 60%-70% of
them.
