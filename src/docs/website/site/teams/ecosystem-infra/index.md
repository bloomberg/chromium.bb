"Establish the infrastructure and culture of testing for the web ecosystem to
ensure a predictable experience."

Our vision is for the web platform to be engineered as a single, cohesive
product. As a natural outcome of our engineering practices and norms, a change
to any one part of the ecosystem reliably propagates to all others, with minimal
friction. The top priority is real-world interoperability of implementations;
standards and tests are important means to that end.
