    LayoutTests/css3/images/...
    LayoutTests/canvas/...
    Mid-quarter-update: Negligible overall reduction this quarter.
    TODO(schenney) check lifetime of new regressions
    End of Quarter: No significant reduction, total count increased
    significantly due to random order test flakiness. Regression tracking
    process failed.
    Non-zero score because we did go down except for factors beyond our control.
    35 -&gt; 34 before random-order jump.

*   ## Owner: [schenney](https://easyokrs.googleplex.com/view/schenney/)
*   ## Definition: bug is a regression that ends up bisected to a commit
            after the M52 branch point, yet made its way
    ## to the stable channel.
    ## Mid-quarter update: at risk. We already have one; crbug.com/635724 might
    leak to M53 stable.
    ## EOQ update: crbug.com/646363 made it to stable M53. crbug.com/637556 made
    it to M52 stable. No bug reached stable due to a triage failure. Problem was
    late reporting of the bug.

*   ## Mid-quarter update: On track for transforms, at risk for clips.
            Computation of transforms without in-tree target knowledge has been
            implemented behind a flag; for clips, there are unit test failures
            to sort out (where the "correct" answer isn't necessarily what the
            test currently expects), and work is being transitioned to new
            owners.
    ## EOQ update: done for transforms (1.0), nearly done for clips (0.8), so
    0.9 overall.

            Currently evaluating performance for transforms, but clips are
            blocked on the previous KR.
    ## EOQ update: nearly done for transforms (0.8) and not started for clips
    (0) so 0.4 overall.

    EOQ grading notes: actual is up by 1.8%. Score=0.6 for doing ok at fixing
    bugs, but lots more bugs keep coming in via triage from other labels.
*   0.90P1Triage all legacy bugs, and triage all new bugs within a 1
            week SLA. Enforce priority 1 meaning.
*   Mid-quarter update: triaging SLA is On Track. Priority 1 bug hygiene
            Needs Work.
    EOQ grading notes: we met the SLA almost every week. Blink&gt;Compositing in
    particular slipped a couple of times.
*   0.70P1Prevent any regressions from reaching the M51 or above stable
            channel
*   Mid-quarter update: M51 just went to stable, so no direct evidence
            yet of success or failure. Therefore On Track.
    EOQ notes: still not sure about M51. needs some bug digging. Tentative score
    of 0.7

    Mid-quarter update: 596382 is fixed (with followup to re-enable safely). The
    other two bugs have some progress
    but Need Work.
    EOQ update: 596382 is fixed. 521364 is halfway done. 470669 is halfway done.

*   Owner: schenney
*   Launch by end of quarter. Tracked in crbug.com/381840
    Mid-quarter update: partially implemented. Need to fix bugs in current
    implementation and commit it. Needs Work.
    EOQ update: All the necessary work done to set the layer as composited, and
    resulting Blink bugs fixed, but blocked on enabling background and
    foreground painting into the same composited layer when the background is
    opaque in order to actually get LCD text on the layer.
*   1.00P1New DOM-order-based paint invalidation tree walk
*   Owner: wangxianzhu
*   Launch by end of quarter
    Mid-quarter update: finished on current PaintInvalidationState. Needs work
    to migrate to PrePaintTreeWalk (PaintPropertyTreeBuilder). On Track.
    EOQ update: Done. Score 1.0.

P1Property trees / SPv2 plumbing

Owners: paint-dev, pdr, trchen

*   0.50P1Property trees in Blink are complete up to the deficiencies of
            the paint artifact compositor.
*   Owners: pdr, trchen
*   Transform trees are complete (including backface visibility,
            flattening, and transform-style).
    Effect trees are complete (including reflection, clip-path, mask).
    Root layer scrolling supported using unittests.
    All of compositing/, fast/, svg/ passing or failing for known&labeled
    reasons like paint artifact compositor deficiencies.
    This includes multicolumn.
    Implement the scroll tree.
    Mid-quarter update: Needs Work. Some progress on transform tree semantics
    and SVG clip paint properties, but a lot more work to do.
    EOQ update: lots of measurable progress was made (transform edge-cases,
    filter tree preparation, html and svg difficult cases) but we still fail a
    significant number of tests (~3100/16728 of fast/ & compositing/ & svg/).
*   1.00P1All direct dependencies in cc on the cc::LayerImpl tree are
            gone, replaced with property trees

*   Owners: vollick, weiliangc
*   Update render target info and draw properties after render surface
            determination.
    Mid-quarter update: Partial work. Rest blocked by target information still
    on clip/transform tree. Wont Meet
    EOQ update: blocked on other KRs, but also not done.
*   0.60P1Transformed layers can be sent as a layer list with property
            trees, rather than a hierarchical layer tree
*   Owners: ajuma, jbroman
*   Mid-quarter update: progressing, with a partial implementation. On
            Track.
    EOQ update: blink-side: score 0.5 can do trivial translations with a layer
    list (and trivial trees), but I'm still working on building non-trivial
    ones. cc side: 1.0. Total: 0.5 (most work is in Blink)
*   0.40P2SPv2 paint invalidation is in place and works behind the
            feature flag for SPv2
*   Owner: wangxianzhu
*   Mid-quarter update: no progress yet. Needs Work.
    EOQ update: Plumbed SPv2 paint invalidation onto spv1 paint invalidation and
    it basically works, but it's still far from the goal of spv2 paint
    invalidation.
*   0.50P1Remove target knowledge from Clip tree and Transform tree
*   Owner: weiliangc
*   Remove target_id and \*_in_target_space in Clip and Transform tree.
    Remove main thread cc's use to to_target transform, use to_screen transform
    instead (including visible rects calculation, sublayer scale, snapping)
    Dynamically calculate draw properties with target info from Effect tree.
    Blocks both Blink/cc API and RenderSurface determination on impl thread.
    Mid-quarter update: Progressing. Needs Work.
    EOQ update: progressing, but still needs plenty of work.
*   0.20P3Cache dynamically calculated draw properties
*   Owner: weiliangc
*   Blocked by Clip and Transform tree clean up and Render Surface
            determination on impl thread.
    Critical for performance, do not block API implementation.
    Mid-quarter update: Still blocked by dynamic calculation. Wont Meet.
    EOQ update: Only moved a small part of properties.

*   ## Have an async implementation that has its scheduling controlled
            by Blink
*   ## Refactor the png encoder integration into skia (SkCodec) in a way
            that allows the workload to be divided into small units of work for
            the purpose of Idle scheduling.
*   ## Stress test should show that a long-running png image encode does
            not interfere with a lightweight 60fps animation on a low spec
            device (2 core CPU).
*   ## (Stretch) Refactor JPEG and WebP encoder integrations into skia,
            and pass the same test described above with these encoders.

            worker can transfer rendered content to an
            ImageBitmapRenderingContext on main thread

## Canvas product stability (grade: 0.40)

*   ## Eliminate all OOM crashes caused ImageData APIs
*   ## Reduce by 50% 2D context losses caused by GPU context resets
