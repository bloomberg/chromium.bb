**Overview**

Project Fugu üê° is an effort to close gaps in the web's capabilities enabling new
classes of applications to run on the web. The developer-friendly landing page
of the project is <https://web.dev/fugu-status/>. The list of in-process APIs is
available at <https://goo.gle/fugu-api-tracker>.
APIs that Project Fugu is delivering enable new experiences on the web while
preserving the web's core benefits of security, low-friction, and cross-platform
delivery. All Project Fugu API proposals are made in the open and on the
standards track.
Fugu is organized as Chromium project, open to all Chromium contributors and
organizations. Today, that includes Microsoft, Intel, Samsung, and Google (among
others). Fugu Leads triage incoming requests from partners, determine demand,
prioritize them, find champions, track development, and help organize the
release and documentation for the capability.

**Monthly Meetings**

To share updates on capabilities work and discuss opportunities and priorities,
we have monthly video chat meetings. The meetings are open to all Chromium
contributors working on Fugu capabilities, regardless of affiliation. Note that
these meetings tend to be high level, and don't dive into technical details. For
an invite to the meeting ask on the #fugu channel on chromium.slack.com or email
fugu-dev@chromium.org. Agendas for upcoming meetings and notes for past meetings
are captured in a shared [Notes
Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vC2IRBel2PIahJLE1Mrnd4nm0OMvWDQcKUQSsfxMFBY/edit#)
