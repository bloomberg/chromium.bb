title: Rendering Core
---

The rendering core team is a long-term engineering team that owns the overall
[rendering pipeline](/developers/the-rendering-critical-path) and most of the
core rendering stages. Specifically style, layout, compositing, and paint. The
team is also responsible for text, fonts, editing, canvas, images, hit testing,
and SVG.

The team is made up of contributors from many different companies and see
regular contributions from many more as well as from individual contributors.

## Team Charter

The rendering core team is focused on the architectural principles of
reliability, performance and extensibility of the core rendering technologies of
the web: HTML, DOM and CSS. We also make sure to satisfy top requests from
customers. Our primary customers are web developers and other teams within
Chrome which build features on top of rendering.

## Priorities

### Scalable Performance

*   Rendering update performance is proportional to the amount of
            change, and “amount of change” has an intuitive explanation.
*   Rendering performance of a component need not depend on where it's
            put within a containing document, or the size of that document.
*   Rendering performance of a document need not depend on the size of
            components contained within it.
*   Same goes for encapsulation - a component can be included without
            breaking a containing page, and a containing page cannot break a
            component.

### Reliability

*   Rendering features work correctly and have rational, understandable
            definitions.
*   Rendering features work the same on all platforms, and on all
            browsers.

### Extensibility

*   Web developers can extend the capabilities of Rendering in novel
            ways without performance or ergonomic penalties.
*   Chromium developers can extend or embed the Rendering code in new
            and novel ways without excessive effort or performance penalties.

## Ongoing Projects

List of ongoing major projects owned by the team or involving multiple team
members.

*   **CSS Containment**
    Ongoing work to optimize performance isolation for CSS containment.
*   **[LayoutNG](/blink/layoutng)**, issue
            [591099](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=591099).
    A new layout system for Blink designed with fragmentation, extensibility and
    interruptibility in mind.
    Phase 1 (block flow) launched in M77.
    Further layout modes (tables, flexbox, grid) and block-fragmentation support
    targeted for 2020.
*   **[Composite After
            Paint](https://docs.google.com/document/d/114ie7KJY3e850ZmGh4YfNq8Vq10jGrunZJpaG6trWsQ/view)**
            (CAP), issue
            [471333](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=471333).
    Previously known as Slimming Paint v2. Project to re-implement the
    Blink&lt;-&gt;CC picture recording API to work in terms of a global display
    list rather than a tree of cc::Layers. It will result in a drastic
    simplification of the way that composited layers are represented in Blink
    and cc, which in turn will yield improved performance, correctness and
    flexibility.
*   **src: local() matching**, issue
            [627143](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=627143).
    Font matching and IPC improvements to allow for spec compliant font matching
    and improved web font performance.

## Contributing

If you're interested in getting involved and contributing to rendering there are
many ways you could help and we'd love to have you. These range from filing good
bug reports to creating test cases, reducing and triaging failures, fixing bugs
and implementing new functionality.

Please see the chromium [getting involved](/getting-involved) guide for generic
advice and to help you get set up.

A good way to get started is to fix an existing bug. Bug fixes tend to be
limited in scope, uncontroversial, and easy to evaluate.

Going through the bug database to find a suitable bug is quite a daunting task
though. To make it a little easier we try to maintain a list of bugs that we
think are suitable starter bugs. Those bugs are marked with a *GoodFirstBug*
label. Use the following queries to see *GoodFirstBug* in the [style &
layout](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=Component%3ABlink%3ECSS%2CBlink%3EFonts%2CBlink%3EFullscreen%2CBlink%3ELayout%2CBlink%3ETextAutosize+Hotlist%3DGoodFirstBug+&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=tiles)
and [paint &
compositing](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=Component%3ABlink%3EPaint%2CBlink%3ECanvas%2CBlink%3ECompositing%2CBlink%3ESVG%2CBlink%3EImage%2CBlink%3EHitTesting%2CBlink%3EGeometry+Hotlist%3DGoodFirstBug+&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=tiles)
components respectively.
If you prefer, the following queries will show all open bugs in the respective
bucket: [style &
layout](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=2&q=Component%3ABlink%3ECSS%2CBlink%3EFonts%2CBlink%3EFullscreen%2CBlink%3ELayout%2CBlink%3ETextAutosize&colspec=ID+Pri+M+Stars+ReleaseBlock+Cr+Status+Owner+Summary+OS+Modified&x=m&y=releaseblock&cells=tiles),

## Documentation

For a high-level overview of the rendering pipeline please see the [Life of a
Pixel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8lm4GV7ahg) ([slide
deck](http://bit.ly/lifeofapixel)) talk that Steve Kobes gave a little while
ago. It gives a very good overview and explains how the different steps in the
pipeline work and interact with each other.

For more in-depth documentation about specific rendering stages see the relevant
markdown files checked into the main source tree. The README.md file in each top
level directory is a good starting point. Some of the key documents are linked
below.

## Design Documents

Each new feature and all major projects require a design document before the
implementation work may commence. These documents are updated during the
implementation phase and provides a detailed explanation of the feature or
project as well as the history and the motivation.

Please add new design documents to the bottom of this list. Make sure they're
world readable and, if possible, grant comment privileges to
*edit-bug-access@chromium.org* rather than *Anyone with a chromium.org account*
as not all contributors have *chromium.org* accounts.
