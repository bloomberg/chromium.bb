title: Animations Team
---

The animations team is an engineering team that aims to enable web developers to
deliver a smoother more responsive web.

The team is responsible for maintaining and improving the animations
infrastructure, correctly effecting threaded scrolling and related effects
(fixed/sticky position, scroll snapping, etc) in the composited property trees,
and ensuring that sufficient targeting and hit testing information is generated
from Blink.

See also our concrete [quarterly
objectives](/teams/animations/animation-objectives).

## Goals

*   Performance - Smooth user interaction and animations (reliable 60fps
            on today's hardware, 120 fps on tomorrow's)
*   Predictability - Interoperable animations APIs on the 4 major
            browser engines.
*   Capabilities - Enable rich scroll and input linked effects popular
            on mobile applications.
