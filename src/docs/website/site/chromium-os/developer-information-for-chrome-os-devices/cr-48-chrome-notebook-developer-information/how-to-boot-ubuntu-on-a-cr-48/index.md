title: How to boot Ubuntu on a Cr-48

Introduction

While [Chrome OS verified
boot](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/verified-boot)
protects against unintended system modification by malicious or buggy software,
**the ability to hack your own device is an
[intentional](/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/developer-mode) design feature
of Google Chrome notebooks**. The instructions for [building your own version of
Chromium OS](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-guide), and
installing it on a Cr-48 are given elsewhere. Some enthusiasts, however, may
want to install something completely different. This page provides an example,
showing how the official Chrome OS software can coexist with
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), a popular linux distribution. I'm assuming
that you're already somewhat familiar with the Chromium OS development
environment.

**Caution: Modifications you make to the system are not supported by Google, may
cause hardware, software or security issues and may void warranty.** Be very
careful.

These instructions work on the Cr-48 as originally shipped. There are several
magic numbers that may change following software updates or on other Chromium
OS-based machines. Even if the numbers don't exactly match, the basic idea is
the same.

In the examples below:

```none
The Cr-48 shell is formatted like this.
```

```none
The Chromium OS build chroot is formatted like this.
```

```none
The standard linux workstation shell is formatted like this.
```

Fair warning

This is kind of a cheat. The Cr-48's boot process does not support
`[initrd](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-initrd.html)`, which
is required by Ubuntu. That leaves us three possibilities:

1.  Use the existing Chrome OS kernel with the Ubuntu rootfs.
2.  Recompile the Ubuntu kernel to do without `initrd`
            ([ugh](/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/cr-48-chrome-notebook-developer-information/how-to-boot-ubuntu-on-a-cr-48#TOC-Ugh)).
3.  Modify the Chrome OS bootstub to handle `initrd`
            ([double-ugh](/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/cr-48-chrome-notebook-developer-information/how-to-boot-ubuntu-on-a-cr-48#TOC-Double-ugh)).

Let's take door #1.

## Free up some SSD space for Ubuntu

To begin our journey, first switch the Cr-48 into [developer
mode](/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/cr-48-chrome-notebook-developer-information)
and reboot. When you see the blue frowny face with the "Chrome OS verification
is turned off" message, either wait 30 seconds or hit Ctrl-D to boot
immediately. This screen is always shown when booting in developer mode, to
ensure that someone doesn't change your OS without your knowledge.

Switch to
[VT2](http://www.chromium.org/poking-around-your-chrome-os-device#TOC-Get-the-command-prompt-through-VT-2)
(press \[ Ctrl \] \[ Alt \] \[ =&gt; \]), and log in as user 'chronos' (no
password required), then run `sudo bash`.

To prevent the lock screen from logging you out of VT2, leave Chrome OS parked
on the login screen. To prevent the backlight from dimming while in VT2, run
sudo initctl stop powerd.

Take a look at the SSD layout. It should be something like this (the UUID values
will all be different, of course):

The units are 512-byte disk sectors.

On Chrome OS there are several bootable images, each composed of a kernel and a
root filesystem (rootfs). For a given image, the kernel and rootfs are stored on
a pair of consecutive partitions. Two of these images, Image-A and Image-B, are
for official Chrome OS:

*   KERN-A and ROOT-A on partitions `/dev/sda2` and `/dev/sda3`
*   KERN-B and ROOT-B on partitions `/dev/sda4` and `/dev/sda5`

When the Chrome OS autoupdater downloads a new image (every six weeks or so, as
new versions are pushed out), it alternately stores it in Image-A and Image-B -
whichever image isn't currently running. The autoupdater even runs in developer
mode, as long as we are running an official Chrome OS image.

For Ubuntu, we'll use the currently unassigned Image-C, composed of KERN-C and
ROOT-C on partitions `/dev/sda6` and `/dev/sda7`, respectively.

However, initially they are too small so, first we need to grow them by stealing
from the upper half of the stateful partition, STATE (`/dev/sda1`). Initially,
STATE is 22622208 512-byte sectors, or just under 11 GB. From this we'll set
aside 16 MB for KERN-C, and 5 GB for ROOT-C.

```none
umount /mnt/stateful_partition
cgpt add -i 1 -b 266240    -s 12103680 -l STATE   /dev/sda
cgpt add -i 6 -b 12369920  -s 32768    -l KERN-C  /dev/sda
cgpt add -i 7 -b 12402688  -s 10485760 -l ROOT-C  /dev/sda
```

Using these values ensures that only the original STATE partition is affected.

Now the partition table should look something like this (changes in **bold**):

<pre><code>

At this point we should destroy the STATE partition contents, because otherwise
at the next boot the startup scripts may notice that it's corrupted and will
erase it using the old size (obtained from dumpe2fs) and not the new one. Best
to be safe and just zap it now. This will take a couple of minutes to run:

```none
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=131072 seek=1040 count=47280
```

To speed up SSD access, we use a block size of 131,072 bytes (128 KB), which
aligns with the SSD erase size.

And now reboot so that the startup script recreates the required files in the
stateful partition. This will do a safe wipe first, so you'll have to wait a bit
(again).

At this point we're through fiddling with the partition table, so you may want
to go back to VT2 and set a password according to these
[instructions](http://www.chromium.org/poking-around-your-chrome-os-device#TOC-Get-the-command-prompt-through-VT-2).

## Acquire an Ubuntu filesystem

First, although the Cr-48 CPU and BIOS is 64-bit, the kernel and rootfs are
presently 32-bit. Since we're reusing the Chrome OS kernel, we'll download and
use the 32-bit ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso from an [Ubuntu CD
mirror](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors). For example:

```none
wget http://mirror.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/CDs/10.10/ubuntu-10.10-desktop-i386.iso
```

Second, even in developer mode, the Cr-48 will only boot external drives that
are signed by Google. That means we can't (easily) use the normal Ubuntu live
installer. Instead, I'll create an empty disk image file with a 5G partition on
it, and use [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/) to install into that. Then
I'll transfer that raw partition onto the Cr-48.

To install VirtualBox (and its command line management tool, `VBoxManage`) on
Ubuntu:

```none
sudo aptitude install virtualbox-ose
```

I'll do this on my normal linux workstation, of course. I'll create the file
inside the chroot so I can use the cgpt tool, but I'll run VirtualBox from
outside. We could create the file using fdisk, but using cgpt ensures all the
numbers match. You could also build the cgpt tool for use external to the
chroot, but whatever.

We'll need our disk image to be a little larger than 5G so it has room for the
GPT headers.

So, do the following in the [Chromium OS
chroot](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-guide#TOC-Create-a-chroot):

```none
cd /tmp
rm -rf test.bin
dd if=/dev/zero bs=512 seek=10486015 count=1 of=test.bin
cgpt create test.bin
cgpt boot -p test.bin
cgpt add -b 128 -s 10485760 -t data -l ubuntu test.bin
```

From outside the chroot, translate the binary into a virtualbox disk:

```none
cd /path/to/chromiumos/chroot/tmp 
VBoxManage convertdd test.bin test.vdi --format VDI
```

Launch the VirtualBox GUI (`virtualbox`) and create a new virtual machine with
2G of RAM. Configure `test.vdi` as the existing hard disk (SATA port 0), and
attach the Ubuntu .iso as the IDE secondary master. Everything else can be left
as default.

Boot the virtual machine and install Ubuntu onto `/dev/sda1`. The Chrome OS
kernel does not use swap memory, so be sure to specify partitions manually.
Select the middle `/dev/sda1`, and format it for `ext2`, and mount on `/`. The
ubuntu installer should warn you that you have no swap partition, and it will
therefore disable swap. This is what we want.

Once Ubuntu is installed, working and updated, shut the virtual machine down and
convert the `.vdi` image back into a binary:

```none
VBoxManage internalcommands converttoraw test.vdi test_new.bin
```

Now, we'll extract just the Ubuntu rootfs partition from the binary file:

```none
dd if=test_new.bin bs=512 skip=128 count=10485760 of=rootfs.bin
```

Next, we copy the ubuntu rootfs directly to the Cr-48 ROOT-C partition
(`/dev/sda7`). To copy the file, run the following command on the Cr-48, where
USER@HOST refers to the account and host from which you are copying.

**Note:** the root filesystem is a huge file that will take quite a while to
upload. This is much less painful with a fast network connection, so, if
possible, use a USB-to-ethernet adapter to avoid going through Wi-Fi.

```none
ssh USER@HOST cat /path/to/rootfs.bin | dd of=/dev/sda7
```

If you have to use Wi-Fi, you can reduce the wait with a bit of compression
(thanks to Jay Lee for pointing this out):

```none
ssh USER@HOST bzip2 -c /path/to/rootfs.bin | bunzip2 -c | dd of=/dev/sda7
```

If your network is flaky you might find it easier to use `scp` to copy the
compressed image to the Cr-48 first, then uncompress and write to `/dev/sda7`.
Or you could just copy the `rootfs.bin` file to a USB stick instead of using the
network, but it's likely to take about as long. You always want to use `dd` to
copy the rootfs image into `/dev/sda7`, of course.
You can see that it worked by mounting the new rootfs and looking around:

```none
mkdir /tmp/urfs
mount /dev/sda7 /tmp/urfs
ls /tmp/urfs
```

While we're looking, let's copy the `cgpt` tool into Ubuntu's rootfs. Make sure
it's executable. We'll need this later.

```none
cp /usr/bin/cgpt /tmp/urfs/usr/bin/
chmod a+rx /tmp/urfs/usr/bin/cgpt
```

We'll need to copy all the kernel modules too.

```none
cd /lib/modules
cp -ar * /tmp/urfs/lib/modules/
```

That should do it.

```none
umount /tmp/urfs
```

## Configure the kernel

The next step is to copy the currently running Chrome OS kernel to KERN-C
(`/dev/sda6`). Remember, an image consists of a kernel and a rootfs on
consecutive partitions. So, to figure out which kernel is running, we can check
which partition is currently mounted as the rootfs:

```none
rootdev -s
```

If this prints `/dev/sda3` (ROOT-A), then our kernel is on `/dev/sda2` (KERN-A).

If this prints /dev/sda5 (ROOT-B), then our kernel is on /dev/sda4 (KERN-B).

Assuming our kernel is on /dev/sda2 (KERN-A), copy it to /dev/sda6 (KERN-C):

```none
dd if=/dev/sda2 of=/dev/sda6
```

Now we need to change the kernel command line to use our Ubuntu rootfs instead
of a Chrome OS rootfs. For this, we'll use `make_dev_ssd.sh`, located in the
Chromium OS source tree under
`src/platform/vboot_reference/scripts/image_signing/.` The [latest
version](http://git.chromium.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=vboot_reference.git;a=tree)
has options to change individual kernel command lines.

Use `scp` to copy it from your host to the stateful partition of the Cr-48. Note
we'll also need `common_minimal.sh from the same directory.`

```none
cd /mnt/stateful_partition
scp USER@HOST:/some/path/to/latest/make_dev_ssd.sh .
scp USER@HOST:/some/path/to/latest/common.sh .
```

Extract the existing kernel command line from KERN-C, and save it to a file
named `foo.6` (the .6 extension is added by the script):

```none
sh ./make_dev_ssd.sh --partitions '6' --save_config foo
```

The default Chrome OS kernel command line looks something like this:

```none
quiet console=tty2 init=/sbin/init add_efi_memmap boot=local rootwait ro noresume noswap i915.modeset=1 loglevel=1 cros_secure kern_guid=%U tpm_tis.force=1 tpm_tis.interrupts=0 root=/dev/dm-0 dm_verity.error_behavior=3 dm_verity.max_bios=-1 dm_verity.dev_wait=1 dm="vroot none ro,0 1740800 verity /dev/sd%D%P /dev/sd%D%P 1740800 1 sha1 50adbfb72bb1efda0c1a86dcd1c1d6a0b46726d1" noinitrd
```

The only editor on the Cr-48 is qemacs, so open foo.6 with qemacs:

```none
qemacs foo.6
```

Edit the file to look like this:

```none
console=tty1 init=/sbin/init add_efi_memmap boot=local rootwait ro noresume noswap i915.modeset=1 loglevel=7 kern_guid=%U tpm_tis.force=1 tpm_tis.interrupts=0 root=/dev/sda7 noinitrd
```

Then save (Ctrl-x Ctrl-s) and exit (Ctrl-x Ctrl-c). qemacs occasionally gets
confused, so double-check to be sure you have the right content:

```none
cat foo.6
```

Finally, use `make_dev_ssd.sh` to replace the kernel command line in KERN-C:

```none
sh ./make_dev_ssd.sh --partitions '6' --set_config foo
```

The kernel command line is part of the kernel partition, and the entire
partition must be cryptographically signed in order to work. We can't replace
the command line part without affecting the entire kernel partition. The script
will save a backup copy before replacing the partition content, but we shouldn't
need it.

## Set boot priority

At this point we should have the following situation:

Image-A is an official Google Chrome OS which can boot either in normal mode or
dev-mode.

Image-B is (or will be after the first autoupdate) another official Google
Chrome OS which can boot either in normal mode or dev-mode.

Image-C is Chrome OS kernel with a modified command line and an Ubuntu rootfs,
which can only boot in dev-mode.

Next, we adjust the priority among the images so we can try out our Ubuntu
image. The image priority is an attribute of its kernel partition. Run `cgpt
show /dev/sda` again, to see the kernel priorities:

<pre><code>
localhost ~ # <b>cgpt show /dev/sda</b>
<b>...</b>
      4096     32768       2  Label: "KERN-A"

                              Type: ChromeOS kernel
                              UUID: F1A2C65C-CC22-FF4A-A8BC-67BA233F3D40
                              Attr: <b>priority=0 tries=15 successful=0</b>

                              Attr: <b>priority=0 tries=15 successful=0</b>
</code></pre>

The priority determines the order in which the BIOS tries to find a valid kernel
(bigger is higher, zero means don't even try). The tries field is decremented
each time the BIOS tries to boot it, and if it's zero, the kernel is considered
invalid (this lets us boot new images without looping forever if they don't
work). The successful field overrides the tries field, but is only set by the OS
once it's up and running.

Let's change the priority of KERN-C to 5:

```none
cgpt add -i 6 -P 5 -T 1 -S 0 /dev/sda
```

This makes KERN-C the highest priority, but only gives us one chance to boot it.
That way if it doesn't work, we're not completely stuck.

If you reboot now, you should come up in Ubuntu! Note that Computer Science
Standard Answer #1 applies: It Works For Me™

If something went wrong and Ubuntu crashes or you powered off, the tries field
for KERN-C will have been decremented to 0 and you'll fall back to booting
Chrome OS.

Assuming that Ubuntu booted and you could log in, go to
Applications-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Terminal to get a shell, and run

```none
sudo cgpt add -i 6 -P 5 -S 1 /dev/sda
```

This will mark the Ubuntu kernel as valid, so it will continue to boot next
time.

Now you can switch back and forth between the official Chrome OS release and
Ubuntu just by flipping the dev-mode switch. Going from dev-mode to normal mode
erases STATE (`/dev/sda1`), but much more quickly. Going from normal to dev-mode
again would normally do a slow erase of `/dev/sda1`, but since we're booting
Ubuntu that doesn't happen.

This works because although KERN-C has the highest priority, it isn't signed by
Google. In dev-mode that's okay, but in normal mode it will be rejected by the
BIOS. Since we've set the successful flag to 1, the BIOS won't mark it invalid
but will just skip it each time. This makes the normal-mode boot time slightly
longer, but only by a second or two.

Of course you could also switch between images from within dev-mode just by
manually setting the priorities with `cgpt` before rebooting.

Note that if the normal image autoupdates, it will probably change the kernel
priorities so that Image-C is no longer the highest and the next time you switch
to dev mode, you will

a) have a long wait,

b) still be running Chrome OS, and

c) have to use cgpt to raise the KERN-C priority again.

But, because autoupdate only switches between Image-A and Image-B, the Ubuntu
kernel and rootfs shouldn't be affected.

## Footnotes

### Ugh

Recompiling the Ubuntu kernel should be possible, with a few caveats:

First, you'll have to modify or reconfigure the kernel to not use initrd.
initramfs should work though.

Second, official Chrome OS still has a few closed-source hardware drivers. The
pure open-source Chromium OS experience is therefore a bit sub-optimal, although
still quite useable.

Third, if you use the 32-bit image, you'll also have to modify the kernel source
to boot correctly from the 64-bit Chrome OS BIOS.

See
<http://git.chromium.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=kernel.git;a=commit;h=a7cfa1075c04df162d58dc2ed93df6045e9c3271>
for details.

If you use a 64-bit image it shouldn't need the boot hacks, but driver support
is much less robust.

Finally, you'll have to sign the kernel yourself and put it into the KERN-C
partition. That is actually the easiest step, but it's not really well
documented. Look in the developer pages.

### Double-ugh

`initrd` is typically handled by the bootloader, which reads the specified image
from the disk into RAM and passes the address to the kernel as it's invoked.

The Chrome OS BIOS is a modified EFI BIOS. The bootstub is a standard EFI
Application, but it's embedded in the kernel image in a dedicated partition
type, rather than accessible through a FAT filesystem. To decrease boot time,
the BIOS does not discover or pass the standard disk drive handles to the
bootstub, so the bootstub doesn't know anything about disks or filesystems.
There is also no Compatibility Support Module in the BIOS. In theory `elilo` or
`grub2` could replace the bootstub, but they would have to reimplement some of
the device discovery functions normally done by an EFI BIOS.

If you want to take this on, go for it. That would let us create a kernel
partition that just contained an EFI bootloader, which could then chain-boot to
external USB drives, etc. That might be kind of cool.
