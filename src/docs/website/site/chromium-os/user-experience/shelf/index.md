**Description:**

The shelf is an on demand target for downloading and uploading. It acts as a
temporary resting place for files that have been accessed, and for content being
uploaded to websites. It uses the same display format as the [content
browser](/chromium-os/user-experience/content-browser) and has similar actions
available.

Functionality:

*   Surfaces as a source in [open/save dialog
            boxes](/chromium-os/user-experience/opensave-dialogs)
*   Surfaces as a source in [content
            browser](/chromium-os/user-experience/content-browser)
*   Appears when content is dragged into the panel bar
*   Allows simple actions to be initiated from each item
*   Replaces the standard download shelf in Chrome.
*   Back button goes up to show other sources

Future goals

*   Sync to cloud
