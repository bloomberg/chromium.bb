*   Keyboard interaction with the screen: anchored, split, attached to
            focus.
*   Launchers as an overlay, providing touch or search as means to
            access web sites.
*   Contextual actions triggered via dwell.
*   Zooming UI for multiple tabs
*   Tabs presented along the side of the screen (see [Side
            tabs](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/user-experience/window-ui))
*   Creating multiple browsers on screen using a launcher
