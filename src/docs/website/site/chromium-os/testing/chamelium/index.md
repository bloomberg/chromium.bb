[TOC]

Chamelium automates external display testing across VGA, HDMI, and DisplayPort
(DP), helping to identify graphics bugs and regressions in a reliable and
scalable way. It can emulate user behavior across a wide range of scenarios,
such as plugging in (or unplugging) an external monitor before or after
suspending, waking, or rebooting a device. It also allows us to simulate all
types of displays on the market, at various resolutions and refresh rates,
including non-standard or flaky behavior.

Chamelium is the public name of the internal Google project Chameleon (similar
to Chromium and Chrome). You may see references to the original codename
throughout the documentation linked below.

Chamelium consists of 3 primary components:

    a hardware board which acts as an external display emulator, simulating
    output over VGA, HDMI, and DP. You can either ask a hardware manufacturer to
    build these for you, or contact
    [chamelium-external+requests@google.com](mailto:chamelium-external+requests@google.com)
    to request a few units.

    an off-the-shelf FPGA board (SoCKit) to capture the output frames, with a
    micro-SD card that provides the Linux image and FPGA configuration. This can
    be purchased from distributors like
    [Arrow](https://parts.arrow.com/item/detail/arrow-development-tools/sockit#eFGz)
    or
    [Terasic](http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=205&No=816).

(Back side of the external display emulator board)

You will need the following equipment to set up all the individual components in
Chamelium:

    1 external display emulator board (described above)

    1 FPGA board (described above). Included in the box should be:

        1 ethernet cable

        1 power adapter

        1 mini-USB to USB-A cable

    1 micro-SD card with at least 1GB of storage

    1 micro-SD card reader

    [1 HSMC flex
    cable](http://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=78&No=275)

    Depending on what you’d like to test, one of each of the following cables:
    HDMI, VGA, and DP

    1 Linux host (workstation or laptop)

    1 USB drive with at least 4GB of storage

The following equipment is optional:

    4 [M3 screws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_case_screws#M3_screw)
    (6mm in length)

    2 washers

    4 M3 nuts (15mm in length)

    4 M3 nuts (6mm in length)

    1 additional VGA cable and 1 external monitor for debugging, if you’d like
    to see the display output as well

### Configure the FPGA board

    Set the jumpers on the top side of the board

        J15 = down

        J16 = down

        J17 = up

        J18 = up

        J19 = down

### Image the SD card

Download
[tio_v3.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_2JbvOBCadLSXUBggBPRHs71Hc7IEqAF/view?usp=sharing)
and unzip it. dd tio_v3.img onto the micro-SD card from your Linux host.

# sudo dd if=tio_v3.img of=/dev/sdx bs=4M oflag=sync

(Replace the above /dev/sd**x** to a proper path, like /dev/sdc, by checking the
SD device)

Now insert the micro-SD card into the FPGA board.

v3 image:

*   Migrated to python3.
*   Only compatible with chameleon-bundles later than 0.0.2-r463.

v2 image (old):
[tio_v2_4G.img.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZITcjsjy8_5WyMRjx1cGMYj8PvlGK3um/view?usp=sharing)

    Increased user space from 20M to 4G.

    Updated glibc from 2.15 to 2.29.

    Fixed broken pip.

v1 image (old):
[tio.image.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9Ff7PW3or-BeHVnQnhkZHBWM2c/view?usp=sharing)

### Configure the external display emulator board

First, attach the HSMC flex cable to connect the two boards.

Optionally, if you’d like a more compact setup, you can stack the FPGA on top of
the external display emulator board and secure them into place per the diagram
below:

**<img alt="image"
src="/chromium-os/testing/chamelium/png%3Bbase644fb8f58c45521404.png">**

Note that the longer nuts should be placed in between the two boards, with the
shorter nuts on the bottom.

### Attach all cables

    Attach the power and HDMI, DP, and/or VGA cables (depending on what
    interface you’d like to test), per the diagram below.

    Connect the other end of the HDMI, DP, and/or VGA cable to the device under
    test (DUT) - the device you’d like to run the tests against.

    Then connect the mini-USB port in the diagram below to your Linux host.

    The additional VGA port next to the ethernet port is optional (it’s for
    debugging purposes only) and should be connected to an external monitor if
    you decide to use it. <img alt="image"
    src="/chromium-os/testing/chamelium/s3x3vmsvmeWSlhdK4GEG60A.png">

    Next, connect the ethernet port on the FPGA to the same network as your
    Linux host and as your DUT.

## Running the tests

### Verify your network setup

    Power on the FPGA board by pressing the red button. This will boot from the
    SD card.

    Connect to the board via UART

# sudo minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -o -w -s

    Select Serial port setup

    Set the terminal to be 115200 8N1, and the Hardware Flow Control to No

    Select Save setup as dfl to save these changes as the default

    Restart the FPGA board

    Once the FPGA is done booting, login as root

    Make sure you can ping the FPGA board from your Linux host, and the Linux
    host from your FPGA. You may need to setup a DHCP server on your Linux host.

    Switch your DUT into developer mode

    Finally, make sure you can ping the DUT from your Linux host.

The IP address will change at each reboot, as the MAC address of the board is
not fixed. You can fix it by running the following commands in uboot (change XX
to hex numbers of your choice):

&gt; setenv ethaddr 0A:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

&gt; saveenv

&gt; boot

### Setup your Linux host, DUT and the FPGA

    [Checkout the source
    tree](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-guide) for Chromium OS

    [Create and enter a
    chroot](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-guide#TOC-Building-Chromium-OS)
    via the command cros_sdk

    Build the packages and images to run the tests

# export BOARD=\[name of your DUT’s board, viewable at chrome://version\]

# ./setup_board --board $BOARD

# ./build_packages --board=$BOARD

    [Install Chromium OS onto your
    DUT](/chromium-os/developer-guide#TOC-Installing-Chromium-OS-on-your-Device)

        Connect your USB drive to your Linux host

        Build a test image

# ./build_image --board=$BOARD test

        Run the command displayed in the output in the terminal, under the
        section, “To copy the image to a USB key, use…”

# cros flash usb:// ../build/images/\[...\]/chromiumos_test_image.bin

        Now, boot your DUT from the USB drive (with the test image) - you’ll
        need to [enter
        vt2](/chromium-os/developer-guide#TOC-Getting-to-a-command-prompt-on-Chro),
        login as root, and run enable_dev_usb_boot. Then, connect your USB drive
        to your DUT and restart - you’ll need to enter \[Ctrl\]-\[u\] at the
        developer mode boot screen.

        After the DUT has booted, switch to vt2, login as root (the password on
        the test image is test0000) and run chromeos-install .

# chromeos-install

        Shutdown the DUT, disconnect the USB drive, and then turn on the DUT.

    On your Linux host, setup the ARM toolchain and set the relevant environment
    variables

# cd ~/trunk/src/scripts

# ./setup_board --board arm-generic

# export CHAMELIUM_IP=\[IP address of the FPGA board\]

# export DUT_IP=\[IP address of the DUT\]

    Make and deploy chameleond on the FPGA

# cd ~/trunk/src/platform/chameleon
# make
# make remote-install CHAMELEON_HOST=$CHAMELIUM_IP

### Setup root password and SSH key

*   There is no password by default. For security concern, we should set
            the password.
*   Set the password on FPGA

# passwd

*   In Chromium OS chroot, copy the public key to FPGA and check it
            works.

# ssh root@$CHAMELEON_IP mkdir -p .ssh

# cat ~/trunk/chromite/ssh_keys/testing_rsa.pub | ssh root@$CHAMELEON_IP 'cat
&gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys'

# ssh $CHAMELEON_IP

### Run the tests

    Set $TEST_NAME to any of the following. Please note that the starred test
    items (\*) require [servo](/chromium-os/servo), and will fail without it.

        display_ServerChameleonConnection

        display_ClientChameleonConnection

        display_SwitchMode

        display_HotPlugAtBoot.extended

        display_SuspendStress.extended

        display_SuspendStress.mirrored

        display_EdidStress

# export TEST_NAME=\[name of the test you’d like to run\]

    Alternatively, you can run an entire test suite by setting $TEST_NAME to
    either of these values, below. Each suite consists of a combination of the
    individual tests listed above.

        suite:chameleon_hdmi

        suite:chameleon_dp

    Run a test [using
    test_that](/chromium-os/testing/test-suites#TOC-How-to-run-suites-with-test_that-)!

# cd ~/trunk/src/scripts

# test_that --board=$BOARD --args "chameleon_host=$CHAMELIUM_IP" $DUT_IP
$TEST_NAME
