## How do I add my project to the CQ?

1.  Add new git repository to
            chromiumos/infra/config/chromeos_repos.star (in the checkout). For
            example, this would be a CL like
            [this](https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/c/chromeos/infra/config/+/1367369/).
2.  After modifying chromeos_repos.star, run ./regenerate_config.sh in
            the base of infra/config.
3.  Email the CL to the CI oncaller.
