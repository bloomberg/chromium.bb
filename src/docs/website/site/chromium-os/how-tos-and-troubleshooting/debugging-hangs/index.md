title: Debugging system hangs (go/cros-debug-hang)
---

If your Chromebook appears hung (i.e. the screen is frozen and the keyboard
and/or trackpad are unresponsive), try the following steps:

*   Pre-Recovery Steps
    *   Note any visible system indicators like LEDs. Are they blinking
                or solid. What color?
    *   Note charging/discharging behavior if possible. Does plugging a
                charger in change LED.
    *   Note USB response. Does touching an gnubby blink. Does charging
                a phone via a USB port work?
*   Recovery Steps
    *   Press **Alt+VolumeUp+X**. If you're using a Chromebox, use F10
                instead of VolumeUp. These three keys need to be pressed in that
                order.
        *   This should cause the Chrome browser to restart, and it may
                    take a few seconds. If the system becomes responsive, go to
                    last step.
    *   Press **Alt+VolumeUp+X** a second time.
        *   This should cause the kernel to panic-reboot. If the system
                    becomes responsive, go to last step.
    *   Press **Alt+VolumeUp+R** which should cause a warm reset &
                reboot. If so, go to last step. (This may not work on older
                hardware.)
    *   Press and hold the **power button** for 8+ seconds and the
                system will power off (if shutdown is clean) or it will reboot
                via EC reset
    *   Press **Refresh+Power button(F3).** This causes an EC reset on
                most systems and should be used only as a last resort as it
                minimizes the amount of available debug info.
*   Last Step
    *   Power on (if necessary) Log in, and immediately file feedback
                using Alt+Shift+i.
        *   Make sure that "Send system and app information" is checked.
        *   Make sure to identify what recovery steps you used including
                    the ones you believed failed.
