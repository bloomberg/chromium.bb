## Introduction

As the [verified boot
library](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/vboot_reference/)
has evolved to meet the needs of firmware, kernel boot, and security, we’ve
discovered some parts of it can be made easier to work with. This document
describes the refactoring of the verified boot library to address these issues.

## Basic Guidelines

### Structures are versioned

Versioning allows readers to check for older/newer structures.
This feature lets us add fields to the structures without necessarily breaking
old readers and provides an upgrade path for newer readers to handle old
structures. Versioning structures will resolve the issue where kernel and
firmware must be updated in unison.
Structures have a major and minor version number.

*   ReaderMajor != StructureMajor - fundamental change in struct; do not
            attempt to parse
*   ReaderMinor == StructureMinor - all is well
*   ReaderMinor &lt; StructureMinor - reading a newer file; fields have
            been added to the struct, but the existing reader will be able to
            ignore them and still function
*   ReaderMinor &gt; StructureMinor - reading an older file; reader
            won’t find the fields added since version StructureMinor, and should
            use default values for those fields

### Key structures keep track of their own key version and algorithm

While public keys generally have some internal structure, it’s not always
apparent. We can use various sizes and algorithms for different keys, so we’ve
defined a `**VbPublicKey**` structure that simply encapsulates the public key
data along with its size and algorithm:

`**VbSignature**` structures are very similar, but instead of the algorithm and
version they only remember the length of data they signed. A signature data blob
is usually a hash that has been encrypted with a private key. The corresponding
public key must be used to extract the original hash. In some cases we may also
use a VbSignature structure for a nonencrypted hash.

### The public key and signature headers know how to find their data

Given a pointer to the `VbPublicKey` or `VbSignature` header, you can find the
corresponding data, which may not be immediately following the header itself.
This lets us put the header structs as sub-structs in the major structures
(preambles, etc.), followed by the data, without needing to pass in data
pointers separately.
Functions should take header pointers rather than raw data wherever possible.

### Common structures are reused

Keys, signatures, and key blocks are used by firmware and kernel algorithms.
Common code for generating and parsing is reused.

## Major structures

### Key block

At the beginning of a firmware or kernel image is a **key block** that contains
the subkey used to sign the rest of the data in the image. The subkey itself is
signed by some higher key, which is presumably more secure or robust.

src="/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/verified-boot-data-structures/keyblock.png">](/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/verified-boot-data-structures/keyblock.png)

The key block itself is either signed (by Google) or simply checksummed (for
self-signed developer images), so only one of the two VbSignatures is used to
validate it. The reason we have two VbSignatures in the key block header is so
that we can build one image that can be validated in either way, which makes
testing and development much simpler.
This key block structure is identical for firmware and kernel images, so the
code to create and verify it can be shared.

### Firmware image

A firmware image consists of a key block, a firmware **preamble**, and the
firmware body. The key block, preamble, and body do not directly point to each
other, so they can be read into separate blocks of memory. The firmware preamble
is signed by the key block, and contains the signature of the firmware body plus
another subkey which will be used to validate the kernel image.

### Kernel image

A kernel image consists of a key block, a kernel preamble, and the kernel body.
The key block, preamble, and body do not directly point to each other, so they
can be read into separate blocks of memory.

## Root of trust

When the device is first powered on, it begins execution from a read-only
section of flash memory. In addition to (hopefully) secure code, that read-only
region contains the primary root keys needed to validate all the rest of the
signed images. The structure that locates the root keys and various other
read-only components is the GoogleBinaryBlockHeader, or “**GBB**”.

[<img alt="image"
src="/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/verified-boot-data-structures/readonly.png">](/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/verified-boot-data-structures/readonly.png)

There are two primary keys in the GBB. The **root key** is used in the normal
boot sequence to sign the read/write firmware, which contains subkeys to sign
the kernel, and so forth. In recovery mode, only the read-only firmware is
executed (because the read/write firmware may have been erased), so the kernel
image on the removable drive is signed by the **recovery key**.
There are a total of six separate keypairs involved in the complete boot process
(see diagrams below):

### Normal boot

1.  Read-only firmware looks in the GBB, finds the root key in read-only
            memory.
2.  The root key validates the read/write firmware’s keyblock, which
            contains the **firmware data key**.
3.  The firmware data key validates the firmware preamble (which
            contains the **kernel subkey**) and the read/write firmware body.
4.  The read/write firmware begins execution.
5.  The read/write firmware uses the kernel subkey to validate the
            kernel’s keyblock, which contains the **kernel data key**.
6.  The kernel data key validates the kernel preamble and the kernel
            blob.
7.  The kernel begins execution.
8.  The kernel image contains the hash of hashes, which is used to
            validate the bundle of hashes used by the block-based rootfs
            validation scheme.
9.  The filesystem driver uses the bundle of hashes to validate each
            block of the rootfs as is read off the disk.

### Recovery boot

1.  Read-only firmware looks in the GBB, finds the recovery key in
            read-only memory.
2.  The recovery key validates the kernel’s keyblock, which contains the
            **recovery kernel data key**. Although it serves the same purpose as
            the kernel subkey in normal boot, it uses a larger key because the
            read/write firmware is not used as an intermediate step.
3.  The recovery kernel data key validates the kernel preamble and the
            kernel blob.
4.  The kernel begins execution.
5.  The kernel image contains the hash of hashes, which is used to
            validate the bundle of hashes used by the block-based rootfs
            validation scheme.
6.  The filesystem driver uses the bundle of hashes to validate each
            block of the rootfs as it is read from the removable media.
