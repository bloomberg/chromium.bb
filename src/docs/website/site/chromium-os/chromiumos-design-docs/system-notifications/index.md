## Summary

ChromeOS has several types of system status and some of them should be notified
to the user. This document summarizes which types of notifications are currently
used and what kind of UI flow is necessary here.

The notifications are usually generated through the internal C++ API for the
[desktop
notifications](/developers/design-documents/extensions/proposed-changes/apis-under-development/desktop-notification-api),
which will appear as the [rich
notification](http://blog.chromium.org/2013/05/rich-notifications-in-chrome.html)
as well.

## Blocking and system notifications

Sometimes normal notifications should be blocked due to the current system
status. For example, all notifications should be queued during the lock screen,
and they should appear when unlocked. It also should be blocked when fullscreen
state; notifications should be annoying when the user watches YouTube videos, or
has a presentation (note: the notifications **should** appear in [immersive
fullscreen](/developers/design-documents/immersive-fullscreen) mode instead,
because the shelf / message center UI is visible in such case).

However, the system status could be so important that they should appear in such
cases. This does not mean all system notifications should appear; some could be
misleading. For example, the notification for taking screenshot would behave as
same as the normal notifications, so it should not appear in the lock screen. In
addition, screenshot notification has the message to 'click to view' but click
should not work in lock screen. On the other hand, connecting display would be
okay to be notified even in the lock screen, it just notifies the new system
status.
