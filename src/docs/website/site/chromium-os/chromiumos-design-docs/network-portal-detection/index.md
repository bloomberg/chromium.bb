[TOC]

Shill, the connection manager for Chromium OS, attempts to detect services that
are within a captive portal whenever a service transitions to the ready state.
This determination of being in a *captive portal* or being *online* is done by
attempting to retrieve the webpage http://clients3.google.com/generate_204. This
well known URL is known to return an empty page with an HTTP status 204. If for
any reason the web page is not returned, or an HTTP response other than 204 is
received, then shill marks the service as being in the *portal* state.

Many, or perhaps most, captive portals found in Hotels, Coffee Shops, Airports,
etc, either run their own DNS server which returns IP address for all queries
which point to their webserver, or they intercept all HTTP web traffic and
return a 302 (redirect) response. The captive portal detection works very
reliably with these types of portal to indicate that the service is not fully
online.

Other captive portals, sometimes run by cellular carriers, provide absolutely no
IP connectivity other than to their own servers, but they use a standard DNS
server and do not intercept HTTP requests. When a ChromeBook connects to this
type of network, the HTTP requests fail because the TCP connection to
clients3.google.com can never be established. The portal code tries multiple
times for up to 10 seconds to connect to clients3.google.com. If it cannot
connect it marks the service as being in a captive portal. This determination is
somewhat unreliable because very high latency connections, lossy connections and
other network issues can also result in failure to connect to
clients3.google.com. All of these are indicative of a network that is not fully
functional, but they do not necessarily indicate that the machine is stuck in a
*captive portal.*

### Shill Service State Machine

### Reverse Path Filtering

By default ChromeOS enables [reverse path
filtering](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Adv-Routing-HOWTO/lartc.kernel.rpf.html) in the
kernel which drops packets received over a network interface inconsistent with
the outbound routing tables. This can present a problem when trying to determine
portal state when connected to multiple networks (WiFi, Wired Ethernet and/or a
Mobile Broadband connection). To avoid dropped packets, shill disables reverse
path filtering globally and on a per device basis while it is running the portal
detection code.

### Shill Implementation

shill attempts to determine the portal state whenever a service transitions to
the *ready* state. It does the determination using libcurl. Several options are
set:

*   libcurl is instructed not to cache DNS entries, and not to allow
            re-use of HTTP connections
*   libcurl is given a 10 second timeout for connection and for the
            entire transaction.
*   libcurl is told to bind to a specific interface so all traffic is
            done over that interface
*   libcurl is explicitly told which name servers to use for name
            resolution
*   reverse path filtering is disabled (see above).

Portal detection can be enabled or disabled on a per service basis, or if that
is not set (set to AUTO), the determination is done based on the default for the
technology.

### Interpretation of Portal State

Chrome and shill use portal state for a variety of reasons.

For prioritizing connections shill always prioritizes an *online* connection
over one in a *portal* state. To the extent that connections using a web proxy
are never marked as *portal* but instead immediately marked as *online* this
inhibits shill's ability to choose the best connection/service.

For cellular connections, and especially for Verizon, Chrome uses portal state
to determine when to put up *toast* which will prompt the user to buy more data.
It also controls the presence of a 'buy data' button on the network
settings/information tabs for the Verizon Wireless service.

When at the OOBE pages and the login screen, Chrome uses the portal state to
prompt the user to check the network connection (more details needed from the
Chrome team).

### Web Proxies

Web proxies present multiple problems for portal state determination. libcurl
supports forwarding requests via a proxy, but this can only be done if the IP
address of the proxy is known. Shill does not currently know the IP address of
the web proxy, nor does it have the ability to evaluate the URL against the
JavaScript code that determines if the proxy should be used.

Several services (e.g. auto update, etc) use Chrome as the engine to fetch URLs,
or use Chrome to evaluate the URL and find out which, if any, proxy to use. This
seems like an appealing solution, but, knowing the proxy is insufficient,
because one might also need to authenticate to the proxy. It is unclear if
Chrome exposes the proxy authentication information. I also do not believe that
Chrome can proper evaluate a URL relative to the proxy settings on a per
interface basis. Chrome almost certainly uses the default connection and the
proxy settings for the default connection when doing HTTP requests and when
evaluating a URL against the JavaScript configuration.

### Future Ideas

*   Improve Chrome to be able to do what libcurl does --- route http
            requests via a specific interface and use the DNS servers associated
            with that interface.
*   Improve Chrome so that it can authenticate to two different proxies
            on two different interfaces simultaneously.
*   Improve Chrome so that it can figure out automatic proxy
            configuration based on DNS lookup of wpad over different names on
            different interfaces. (etc....)
*   Have the ChromeOS connection manager ask Chrome to fetch the URL
            instead of libcurl.

Or

*   Do much of the above, but have Chrome return proxy authentication as
            well as IP address for a given URL, so that shill can pass the proxy
            information to libcurl (or implement it all ourselves in shill).
