Firmware Update Processes and Utilities

**Flashrom**

Chromium OS currently uses Flashrom as the firmware update tool of choice for
x86, and has cross-platform ports for ARM, MIPS, and others. Flashrom is an
open-source, cross-platform EEPROM programming utility with an active community
and a large combination of supported host chipsets, flash memory devices, and
external programmers. The code is generally adaptable to a wide variety of
chipsets and interfaces and is thus a good candidate for servicing the needs of
Chromium OS platforms.
