## Abstract

This document describes details about how the autoupdate system works. For a
high-level view of autoupdate, and information about the filesystem, see [File
System/Autoupdate](/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/filesystem-autoupdate).

The autoupdate system provides bit-for-bit-exact in-place filesystem updates
with file-level binary diffs.

## **Goals**

*   Updates should be as small as we can reasonably make them.
*   An update must result in a root-filesystem partition in which each
            disk block is exactly (bit-for-bit) as specified by the OS vendor,
            so that the update can be signed on the server (for verified boot).
*   Updates must be applied in place, so that many delta updates can be
            installed without rebooting. For example: if a user is booted into
            version N, and N+1 is released, the user downloads the (N→N+1)
            update and installs. If the user is still booted into N when N+2
            comes out, then the user downloads the (N+1→N+2) update and in-place
            installs it over N+1.

## **Overview of the install procedure**

The client will have a partition (which we'll call the "install partition") on
which to install a delta update. This partition will already contain some
version of the operating system.

The client will contact the autoupdate server to request an update, specifying
the version number of the system installed on the install partition. The server
may provide the client with a delta update which the client will download.

The delta update file contains an ordered list of operations to perform on the
install partition that will take it from the existing version to the new
version.

## **Overview of the delta update file format**

Note: The destination partition is composed of 4K blocks.\[1\]

The update file is an ordered list of operations to perform. Each operation
operates on specific blocks on the partition. For each operation, there may be
an optional data blob, also included in the update file.

The types of install operations are:

*   Copy: copy some blocks in the install partition to other blocks in
            the install partition. This can be used to move a block to a new
            location, or to copy a block to temporary storage; for more
            information, see the example below.
*   Bsdiff: read some blocks into memory from the existing install
            partition, perform a patch (binary diff) using the attached data
            blob, and write the resulting updated blocks to specified blocks in
            the install partition. (See below for more details.)
*   Replace: write the attached data blob to specified blocks in the
            install partition.
*   Replace_bz: B-unzip the attached data blob and write the result to
            specified blocks in the install partition.

A traditional diff update to a file (using bsdiff) works like this: the old file
and the patch file are read into memory. Next, a patch operation is performed in
memory, resulting in the new file being in memory. Finally, the new file is
written to disk.
We modify that operation slightly. We tell the patch program that the old file
is the install partition. However, rather than have the program read the entire
partition into memory, we tell it which blocks to read. Then the patch operation
is performed in memory. Finally, the result is written directly to the install
partition, but not at the beginning of the device: we will tell the program
which blocks to write the result to.

## **Generating delta update files**

This section describes how the OS vender creates an update file.

The update file format will be:

1.  Magic number ('CrAU')
2.  Version number
3.  Eight bytes for protobuf length
4.  The protobuf
5.  Collection of data blobs
6.  EOF

The protobuf is a series of instructions that the client must perform in order.

Note: To specify a set of blocks, we use an extent, which is simply a contiguous
range of disk blocks. For example, rather than specify blocks {10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 17, 18}, it can be simpler to specify { (10, 6), (17, 2) } (a list of
extents).
message Manifest {
message InstallOperation {
enum CompressionType { COPY = 0, // file is unchanged; just move data blocks
BSDIFF = 1, // Read source data blocks as old file, included binary blob is
diff, output to new blocks REPLACE = 2, // Output included binary blob to new
blocks REPLACE_BZ = 3 // Bunzip binary blob into new blocks } uint64
blob_offset; // if present, the offset in the update image of the binary blob
for this file uint64 blob_length; // if present, the length of the binary blob
message extent { uint64 offset; // in blocksize uint64 length; // in blocksize }
repeated extent input_extents; repeated extent output_extents; }
repeated InstallOperation install_operations;
}

To generate a delta update, we iterate over each regular file on the new
filesystem. We get an ordered list of all datablocks in the file, then store
those in a File struct:
struct Extent {
uint64 start;
uint64 length;
}
struct File {
string path; // path within the filesystem
vector&lt;Extent&gt; dst_extents; // ordered list of all extents on the new
filesystem
vector&lt;Extent&gt; src_extents; // Applies only for COPY and BSDIFF
enum CompressionType; // one of: COPY, BSDIFF, REPLACE, REPLACE_BZ
}

Note: eventually, each File object will be converted into an InstallOperation
message in the protobuf.
For each file, we look for the optimal way to compress it. If the file has
changed, then we compare the sizes of the binary-diff, uncompressed, and bzip
options, and we pick whichever yields the smallest file size.

We then create a vertex in a graph for each File object. Alongside the graph, we
also create a vector to represent each block in the install partition:
struct Block {
File\* reader;
File\* writer;
}
vector&lt;Block&gt; blocks; // length is the size of the install partition

We then go through each block in each File object. For each block, we set the
reader and writer parameters of the blocks vector.

Next, we iterate through the blocks array, and for each block with a different
reader and writer (which are both non-null), we create an edge in the graph from
the writer to the reader. An edge in the (directed) graph points to a file
operation that must complete before the edge's source file operation starts.
Thus, we are trying to ensure that if a block is both read and written by
different file operations, the block is read before it's written. The edge
represents blocks in the graph, so the edge's weight is the number of blocks.

At this point, we are likely to have a graph with cycles. We must break the
cycles. We find the cycles with Johnson's circuit finding agorithm
([PDF](http://dutta.csc.ncsu.edu/csc791_spring07/wrap/circuits_johnson.pdf)) and
Tarjan's strongly connected components agorithm. For each cycle, we find the
lowest-weight edge and cut it\[2\]. We cut an edge as follows: create a new node
that represents an operation of copying some extents to scratch space. We then
make the edge's source node point to the new node. We also modify the cut edge's
destination node to read from the scratch space rather than from the blocks
represented by the edge we're cutting.

Here's an example of cutting an edge to break a cycle. Operation A reads block 3
to write block 4. Operation B reads block 4 to write block 10.

Once the cycles are broken, we can use a topological sort to order all the
nodes. Then we convert each node to an InstallOperation and add it to the
Manifest structure. If the client were to download and install the Manifest at
this point, all the blocks that contain filedata would be set correctly.
However, we also need non-filedata blocks to be set correctly. To handle
non-filedata blocks, we create a single final InstallOperation of type
REPLACE_BZ which writes to all extents that don't contain filedata. The attached
data blob contains the bzip2-compressed data to go into those blocks. In
practice, this takes up about 2 megabytes compressed.

## **Streaming**

Because the protobuf (which lists all operations) occurs at the beginning of the
file, the update doesn't need to be saved to disk. It can be applied while
streaming from the server.

We do need to make sure that the update is signed by the OS vendor. We can begin
to apply the update and not mark it bootable until after the delta update
signature is verified.

## **Alternatives considered**

The solution presented here is not the only one we considered, but it is the
only one we've found that gives the best compression ratio in practice. Other
solutions considered were:

*   Delta-compress the entire partition
    Bsdiff can't delta-compress the entire partition because its memory
    requirements are too high. During patching, it needs enough memory to store
    the original and new files, which in our case could have been over 1
    gigabyte.
    However, another delta compression program, Xdelta, uses a sliding window.
    In practice, this resulted in poor compression. On a test corpus, the diff
    was hundreds of megabytes.

*   rdiff
    Rdiff works by storing only changed blocks in the delta file. It uses a
    sliding window so that blocks don't need to be aligned. When pointed at the
    testing corpus, an rdiff delta of the entire partition was 104M, well above
    the roughly 10M the proposed algorithm takes for the same corpus.
    In the future, we might consider using rdiff-style (that is, rsync-style)
    delta compression at the file level. We could drop that in alongside bsdiff
    in the future.

## **Footnotes**

\[1\] Some of these blocks contain file-data and some contain other data
(metadata, for example). Since we are using ext4, which (at the time of writing)
doesn't support fragments, we know that a block cannot contain file data for
more than one file: a block either contains file data for one file or no files.
\[2\] In our tests, with the greedy agorithm (cut an edge in each cycle as it's
found), we cut about 28 MB worth of edges, which seems reasonable. Enumerating
all cycles and cutting no edges, we found over 5,000,000,000,000,000 cycles, so
it's absolutely infeasible to consider all cycles before making cuts. To cut
cycles more efficiently, though, we might consider more than 1 cycle before
making cuts (perhaps 1000 cycles or so).
