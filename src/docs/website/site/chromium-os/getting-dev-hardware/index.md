Device manufacturers and silicon vendors who have systems or developer boards
that can be used for Chromium OS development will be posting information about
their development systems/boards, pre-release builds that work with the
hardware, and directions for obtaining hardware in the discussion group
[chromium-os-dev](http://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-os-dev).

Developers, manufacturers, and vendors have summarized their experiences with
developer boards and systems in the [Developer
Hardware](/chromium-os/getting-dev-hardware/dev-hardware-list) page, which
contains a list of systems that run pre-release builds of Chromium OS.

There is also information on [official Chrome OS
devices](/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices).
