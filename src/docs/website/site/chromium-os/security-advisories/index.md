title: Chrome OS Security Advisories

The following is a list of security advisory pages published on
<https://www.chromium.org>.

Note that we do not routinely publish information for all fixed vulnerabilities
on a dedicated page, just for vulnerabilities where users/customers will benefit
from a more in-depth description of the issue and/or where mitigative action by
the user is necessary. Thus, the majority of security bug fixes will not be
listed here but handled as [security bugs in the bugs.chromium.org
tracker](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?can=1&q=Type%3DBug-Security+OS%3DChrome)
and the fixes will be rolled out transparently to devices with the Chrome OS
auto-update mechanism.
