## Overview

The Universal 22.5 W Dual Port USB Type-C charging adapter is a "shared
capacity" USB-C power source. A shared pool of 22.5W (4.5A at 5V) is divided
between two USB-C receptacles. USB Type-C Current transitions are used to
dynamically adjust the Source's power advertisement to both ports based on the
sinks' load.
