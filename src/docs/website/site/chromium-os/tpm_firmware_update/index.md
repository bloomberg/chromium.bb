## Vulnerability description

There is a bug in certain Infineon TPM firmware versions which results in RSA
keys generated by the TPM being vulnerable to an attack that allows to recover
the private half of the RSA key from just the public key. The researchers who
found the vulnerability have published high-level information here:
<https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/public/papers/rsa_ccs17>. Currently known exploits are
computationally expensive; specifically, for RSA keys of bit size 2048, the
researchers give an estimate of 140.8 CPU years to break a single key. Note that
this figure might drop as more researchers look at the attack. At the current
point in time, it means TPM-generated RSA keys can't be broken at large scale,
but targeted attacks are possible. To summarize: There exists a practical attack
against TPM-generated RSA keys, but it doesn't allow large-scale exploitation of
Chrome OS devices.

## Impacted features

Chrome OS relies on TPM-generated RSA keys for a number of features:

    Slowing down brute-force attacks against encrypted user data. The page
    [Protecting Cached User
    Data](/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/protecting-cached-user-data)
    describes this in more detail. The vulnerability allows the attacker to
    brute-force the encryption key (bit size 2048) off-device. However, note
    that off-device brute-force attacks are only advantageous against strong
    passwords - weak passwords are still less expensive to brute-force against
    the TPM regardless of whether it runs vulnerable firmware or not.

    Hardware-backed encryption keys / certificates. Chrome OS allows users to
    generate and import RSA keys that are protected by the TPM so the main OS
    can't access the private key. These keys are typically accompanied by a
    certificate and then used in network authentication, such as WPA2-EAP, HTTPS
    client authentication, etc. The vulnerability allows attackers to determine
    the private key. The bit size of generated and imported keys depends on
    parameters. The bit sizes supported by Chrome OS for TPM-backed keys are
    1024 or 2048. You can check key sizes for certificates backed by TPM keys at
    chrome://settings/certificates.

    Chrome OS [Verified
    Access](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7156268) allows network
    services to verify client device integrity and identity. TPM-generated RSA
    keys (bit size 2048) are used in the certification process. Attackers can
    exploit the vulnerability to break an "Attestation Identity Key", which
    allows them to impersonate a legit device from an endpoint of their choice.

## Mitigations

In Chrome OS M60, we strengthened Chrome OS user data protection using the
scrypt password hashing scheme to act as a second line of defense even in case
the brute-force protection afforded by the TPM is lost. Users were automatically
upgraded to the new scheme behind the scenes without user-observable effects.
This measure guarantees adequate protection of encrypted user data for users
that use strong passwords. If your password isn't strong, now is a good time to
fix this - the risk involved with using a weak password generally transcends
Chrome OS and affects other places that store sensitive data.

For hardware-backed encryption keys and Verified Access, mitigations are
technically infeasible without losing the hardware binding, and thus breaking
the feature. The only supported path to restore the designed security strength
for these features is to update TPM firmware.

See below for advice on whether and when to update TPM firmware.

## Affected TPM firmware versions

You can check the TPM firmware running on your device by looking at the
firmware_version line of the tpm_version entry in chrome://system. If the
tpm_version entry is absent, this is likely because you are running an old
Chrome OS version which doesn't report this information. Upgrade to a newer
version and check again.

Vulnerable firmware versions used on Chrome OS are (listing the firmware_version
value from chrome://system as well as the human-readable version number):

*   000000000000041f - 4.31
*   0000000000000420 - 4.32
*   0000000000000628 - 6.40
*   0000000000008520 - 133.32

Fixed firmware versions are as follows:

*   0000000000000422 - 4.34
*   000000000000062b - 6.43
*   0000000000008521 - 133.33

## TPM firmware update

Recent Chrome OS builds of version M61 and later include functionality to
install a TPM firmware update on the affected devices. After installing the
update, RSA keys generated by the TPM are no longer vulnerable against the
attack described above.

### Chrome OS versions including the firmware update

The following Chrome OS versions include the TPM firmware update for affected
devices (note that chromium OS builds do not contain firmware files):

*   Chrome OS M61 - build 9765.81.0 and later
*   Chrome OS M62 - build 9901.42.0 and later
*   Chrome OS M63 - build 10020.0.0 and later

The one exception is link / Google Chromebook Pixel, for which the TPM firmware
update functionality is not enabled yet. There is a problem with firmware update
installation on that device, we intend to ship an update with a fix to enable
the TPM firmware update as soon as possible.

### Things to know about the update process

Installing the TPM firmware update requires a hardware reset of the TPM chip.
This means that all data held by the TPM will be discarded. This includes disk
encryption keys, implying all user data stored locally on the device will be
lost. Thus, you need to carefully backup any important data before you install
the update.

We are actively working on ways to allow updated TPM firmware to be installed
without losing all data on the device. Launch dates for these non-destructive
update flows are not confirmed at this point though.

There is also a risk that the update will fail e.g. due to loss of power while
installing the update. See **below** for more information on how to recover from
this situation. You'll need Chrome OS recovery media in order to invoke the
recovery flow. You will want to make sure that you either prepare it before
starting the TPM firmware update just in case or have another computer available
to create recovery media in case you need it.

### Deciding whether to install the update

There is no one-size-fits-all advice on whether to install the update or not. As
described above, there are inherent inconveniences and risks associated with the
update process and a limited set of features is impacted by the vulnerability.
In order to help make an informed decision, here is some guidance. If any of the
following applies, consider installing the update:

    You rely on the highest level of protection that Chrome OS can offer for
    your encrypted user data (TPM-backed protection against password
    brute-forcing attacks).

    You are using hardware-backed encryption keys and corresponding certificates
    to access network services such as corporate web sites, VPNs. etc. If you're
    unsure you can check the "your certificates" section in
    chrome://settings/certificates to see whether you have any hardware-backed
    certificates.

    You are using [Verified
    Access](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7156268) for device
    authentication on your enterprise-managed Chrome OS devices. When in doubt,
    ask your administrator.

If none of the bullets above apply to you, you don't benefit from the update and
can safely skip it, thus avoiding potential complications due to failing updates
as described above.

### Installing the update

Due to the implied loss of data, users must trigger the update explicitly. To do
so, users can opt in to installing the TPM firmware update as part of the
[factory reset flow](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/183084) also
known as "powerwash". Note that for enterprise-managed devices, the powerwash UI
is not regularly available. We have added a TPM firmware update device policy
though which admins can set to make the TPM firmware update via powerwash
available to their users.

The steps are as follows:

    Trigger the powerwash flow, either via Ctrl+Alt+Shift+r on the login screen,
    or via the powerwash option in chrome://settings &gt; Advanced.

    The flow will ask you to reboot unless you have just restarted your device
    anyways.

    In the powerwash dialog, there will be a checkbox "Update firmware for added
    security." Check it in order to request the TPM firmware update to be
    installed.
    If you don't see a checkbox, this can be due to a number of reasons:

        Your device already runs updated firmware, check chrome://system as
        described above to confirm.

        You are running an older Chrome OS version that doesn't include
        functionality to update TPM firmware. Upgrade to a newer OS version.

    Once you click the "Powerwash" button and confirm, the device will reboot.

    After the reboot, you'll see a message indicating that the powerwash is in
    progress. Wait for it to complete, after which the device will reboot again.

    After the second reboot, the device will show a message screen when
    installing the firmware update. There is a progress bar that will be updated
    as the update progresses. The device will reboot once more after installing
    the update.

    After the third reboot, you'll see the familiar Chrome OS UI again showing
    the out of box experience. Your device is just as new, so you can go through
    the setup flow again and then log in as usual.

    It’s worth double-checking you are running fixed TPM firmware by checking
    the tpm_version entry in chrome://system. See the **Affected TPM firmware
    versions** section for details.

### Retrying a failed update

There is a risk that the device will no longer boot if the update fails. This
happens when the update installation gets interrupted while on the installation
progress screen, for example due to power loss. The device will show a screen
saying "Chrome OS is missing or damaged". If you press Tab on this screen,
you'll see some additional information including a line labelled
"recovery_reason". If the boot failure was due to an earlier failed TPM firmware
update, you'll likely see "Secure NVRAM (TPM) initialization error" as
"recovery_reason".

Devices in this state can be recovered via [Chrome OS
recovery](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595). Recovery images
for versions that have the TPM firmware update (see above) include functionality
to retry a TPM firmware update that has previously failed. Follow these steps to
recover:

    Make absolutely sure that your device is connected to a reliable power
    source and has a charged battery (if applicable).

    Press Esc+Refresh+Power (keep holding Esc+Refresh for a while after
    releasing power) in order to start recovery mode. The device will boot to a
    screen that says "Chrome OS is missing or damaged" (older devices) or
    "Please insert a recovery USB stick or SD card" (newer devices).

    Plug the recovery media.

    The device will launch the recovery procedure, starting with verification of
    the recovery media.

    If the recovery software determines the TPM has encountered a previous
    failed update, it will automatically launch the TPM firmware update
    installation process. You'll see a screen indicating the update is getting
    installed, with a progress bar getting updated as the update progresses.

    After successful installation of the update, the device will reboot.
    Afterwards, the device should boot to the familiar Chrome OS UI again
    showing the out-of-box experience.

### Troubleshooting recovery failure

The recovery software will show a screen saying "The security module on this
device is not working" if it encounters a bug or a condition that the recovery
software is unable to fix. If you see this, you'll want to ask for help either
via [Chromebook Central Help
Forum](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/chromebook-central) or via
EDU / enterprise support channels (if applicable). There are some important
pieces of evidence to gather that are helpful in figuring out the root cause of
the failure:

    Hold on to recovery media. The recovery software stores diagnostic
    information on it, so do not use it for recovery attempts on other devices
    and do not overwrite otherwise. The log files can be found on the first
    partition under "recovery_logs" and contain a trace of the recovery software
    execution flow which is invaluable in tracking down the root cause for the
    failure.

    Take note of the information shown by pressing Tab on the "Chrome OS is
    missing or damaged screen" e.g. by snapping a photo. The recovery_reason
    line is particularly interesting as it may indicate clues as to what state
    the TPM is in.

### Subsequent TPM firmware update prompt

Due to a [bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=872746) in
the original implementation of the TPM firmware update flow, a vulnerable
Storage Root Key (a key held in the TPM that is used to encrypt other keys) from
before the update may remain even after completing the update. This affects a
small number of devices that did not finish the TPM firmware update in normal
boot mode but only after retry using a recovery image. This can be addressed by
performing another powerwash to clear the TPM again and thus regenerate a new
Storage Root Key that is not vulnerable. Chrome OS M70 and later will show a
one-time system notification saying "Security upgrade available" / "Reset your
Chromebook to upgrade your security" for each user to alert of them of the
situation. Users should re-evaluate their situation per the
[advice](/chromium-os/tpm_firmware_update#TOC-Things-to-know-about-the-update-process)
[above](/chromium-os/tpm_firmware_update#TOC-Deciding-whether-to-install-the-update)
to decide whether they want to perform the powerwash, which can be triggered by
invoking the firmware update flow again via chrome://chrome.

### Manually Updating

If you want to apply the update manually for any reason (e.g. you're using a
Chromebook Pixel (link)), here's the steps required.

1.  Put the device into dev mode
    *   See the [official list of
                devices](/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices)
                for more details
2.  If you're already in dev mode, you'll need to
            [Powerwash](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/183084) or
            go through
            [recovery](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/1080595) to
            reset the TPM back to the correct initial state
3.  Boot the device until you get to the initial OOBE screen (where you
            select network/etc...)
    *   Don't sign in!
4.  Switch to a console by pressing Ctrl-Alt-F2 (the -&gt; key is the
            same as F2)
5.  Log in using the "root" username (there should be no password)
6.  Type this command (all on one line):
    `dbus-send --system --dest=org.chromium.SessionManager --type=method_call
    /org/chromium/SessionManager
    org.chromium.SessionManagerInterface.StartTPMFirmwareUpdate
    string:first_boot`
7.  After a few seconds, the device should reboot
    *   If the device doesn't reboot, check `/var/log/messages`. If it
                says something about a user already having logged in, go back to
                step 2.
8.  Press Ctrl-D to boot
9.  Wait for the powerwash step to finish and reboot (should be quick)
10. Press Ctrl-D to boot
11. Wait for the installing update step to finish
12. If the device reboots and takes you back to the login screen, you're
            done
13. If you get an error, perform the steps described above to [retry a
            failed
            update](/chromium-os/tpm_firmware_update#TOC-Retrying-a-failed-update).
            Note that there is a known issue with original Chromebook Pixel
            (link) devices:The original TPM firmware version fails installing
            the firmware update just before completion. The device may or may
            not boot normally after turning it off and on again. It is critical
            to go through Chrome OS recovery again to reset the TPM into a good
            state and flush out all weak keys. You have been warned!
14. If things still aren't working, then review the troubleshooting
            sections above
