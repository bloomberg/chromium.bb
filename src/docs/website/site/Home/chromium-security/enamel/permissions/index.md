## Testing New Permissions

It's important to test new permissions adequately to ensure they behave as
expected and regressions are caught. Features that have permissions tend to be
privacy or security sensitive and if there are circumstances where a malicious
website can access the feature without adequate user approval it can have a
particularly negative impact. Please see [Testing New
Permissions](https://docs.google.com/a/chromium.org/document/d/1daQk9A05T0BcSMO9KQQN8x0TdT2a23KqAkS7maIUJT0/edit?usp=drive_web)
for important test cases to consider when adding new permissions.
