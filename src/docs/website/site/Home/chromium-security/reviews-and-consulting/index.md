So, ya need some security help? Our talents are many, but here are the things we
normally assist Chromium engineers with:

**Security Reviews**

Features that are new or substantial refactors / expansions should go through
the [Chrome Security Review](/Home/chromium-security/security-reviews) process
via the Chrome launch process. The purpose of a security review is ==not== the
elimination of all possible vulnerabilities, but rather the promotion of [secure
design and implementation practices in
Chromium](/Home/chromium-security/education). It also helps the security team
stay engaged with the rest of Chromium engineering.

**Adding new code to third_party**

Third party code is a hot spot for security vulnerabilities, so make sure to
[give security a head's up by getting a code
review](http://www.chromium.org/developers/adding-3rd-party-libraries#TOC-Get-a-Review).

**One-off questions**

If you are not sure what to do, or need other help, you can always just reach us
at [security@chromium.org](mailto:security@chromium.org).
