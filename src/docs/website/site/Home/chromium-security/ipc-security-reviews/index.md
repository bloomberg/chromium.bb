**So, you want to help with IPC reviews?** Fantastic! Security bugs in IPC have
nasty consequences, so we have a little background check and ramp up process:

**First, tell [us](mailto:security@chromium.org) a bit about your security
interest and experience and confirm you've done your homework.** Entrusting you
with this responsibility only makes sense if you care about Chromium security,
so tell us why you want to do this. Do you have a history of helping find / fix
security bugs? Have you helped with security-relevant software design or
projects? Tell us a bit about your security interests and experience.

You should also confirm that you've read and understand all of our doc on
[security tips for
IPC](/Home/chromium-security/education/security-tips-for-ipc).Is anything
unclear? Can you suggest or make improvements? Docs have a tendency of going
stale.

**Next, we'll partner you up on some reviews.** We'll typically have you do ~3
IPC reviews yourself with an existing reviewer doing a second pass.

If all that looks good, you're on board!
