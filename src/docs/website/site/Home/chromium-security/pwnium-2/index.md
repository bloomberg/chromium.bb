**HOW TO ENTER: NO PURCHASE NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN. To enter the Program, visit the Google desk at HITBSecConf2012 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia during the Program Period. Entrants are entirely responsible for all costs and fees associated with attending the HITBSecConf2012, including (but not limited to) admission fees, transportation, accommodation and living costs. For additional information visit the Program website located at <https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/pwnium-2> before or during the Program Period and follow the instructions for submitting an Exploit that highlights a critical importance security issue, which has not yet been reported to, or otherwise come to attention of, the Chromium project. The Exploit must meet the “Exploit Requirements,” described below. All entries must be received before the end of the Program Period. Entries are void if they are in whole or part illegible, incomplete, damaged, altered, counterfeit, obtained through fraud, or late. All entries will be deemed made by the authorized account holder of the email address submitted at the time of submission, and potential reward recipients may be required to show proof of being the authorized account holder for that email address. The "authorized account holder" is the natural person assigned to an email address by an Internet service provider, online service provider, or other organization responsible for assigning email address for the domain.**
**EXPLOIT REQUIREMENTS: The Exploit must meet the following criteria:**
**• Be an unreported and original exploit, which has not been shared or partially shared with anyone else or submitted in any other contests until it has been submitted to, and judged by, Google.**
**• Be an exploit relying on an unreported and original bug, bugs or security feature in Chrome or in Chrome when used in connection with Windows, Flash or other software e.g. drivers.**
**• Be a remote exploit accessible through the Chrome browser, which works and is reliable.**
**• Be present in the most recent supported channel(s) of Chrome, running on the latest version of Windows7 on the provided test machine.**
**• Be a critical vulnerability of high impact.**
**• Be authored or created by You.**
**• Be submitted with corresponding documentation that details each bug exploited.**
**During the Program Period, Google and/or its agents will be evaluating each Exploit to ensure that it meets the Exploit Requirements. Google reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify any entrant who submits an Exploit that does not meet the Exploit Requirements.**
**JUDGING: Each Exploit submission will be judged by a panel of experts who are employees of Google (“Judges”). Each Exploit will be evaluated by the Judges as to whether the Exploit is a critical importance vulnerability of high impact based on the potential for persistent access to the user’s account on the Windows operating system.**
**Judges will evaluate each Exploit based upon the above criteria to determine whether it is critical impact and qualifies for a reward. Rewards will be allocated on a first-come-first-served basis, based on time of submission during the Program Period specified above, until such time as the total reward pool of $2,000,000 USD (two million U.S. dollars) is exhausted.**
**In the event a potential reward recipient is disqualified for any reason, the reward allocated to that recipient will be returned to the total reward pool. The potential reward recipients will be selected and notified by telephone and/or email, at Sponsor’s discretion. If a potential reward recipient does not respond to the notification attempt within five days from the first notification attempt, then such potential recipient may be disqualified and their allocated reward will be returned to the total reward pool. With respect to notification by telephone, such notification will be deemed given when the potential reward recipient engages in a live conversation with Sponsor or when a message is left on the potential reward recipient’s voicemail service or answering machine by the Sponsor, whichever occurs first. Except where prohibited by law, each potential reward recipient may be required to sign and return a Declaration of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release and provide any additional information that may be required by Sponsor. If required, potential reward recipients must return all such required documents within seven days following attempted notification or such potential reward recipient may be deemed to have forfeited the reward and the reward may be returned to the total reward pool. In the event the potential reward recipient is a minor, his or her parent or legal guardian must sign the documents and return them as described herein. All notification requirements, as well as other requirements within these Rules, will be strictly enforced. In the event that no Exploits are received, no rewards will be awarded. Determinations of judges are final and binding.**
