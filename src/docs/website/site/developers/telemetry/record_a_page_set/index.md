[TOC]

We record page sets so we control network conditions and other changes in the
live sites, leading to more stable benchmarks.

## Write a page set

Before you can record a page set, you need to write it! If you want to record a
pre-existing page set, you can skip this step.

Page sets are located in
[`tools/perf/page_sets`](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/tools/perf/page_sets/).
A simple page set with one URL looks like:

<pre><code>from telemetry.page import pagefrom telemetry.page import page_setclass MyPageSet(page_set.PageSet):  def __init__(self):    super(MyPageSet, self).__init__(        user_agent_type='<b>desktop</b>',        archive_data_file='<b>data/my_page_set.json</b>',        bucket=page_set.PUBLIC_BUCKET)    self.AddPage(page.Page(        name='example',        url='<b>http://example.com/</b>',        page_set=self))
</code></pre>

Telemetry spoofs Chrome's User-Agent field, and `user_agent_type` tells it
whether to use a desktop, mobile, or tablet user agent. We generally only use
one recording for all platforms.

The `archive_data_file` contains metadata about which pages are stored in which
archive files. You need to specify its location, and it will be generated when
recording the page set.

Note that the naming convention of page set file is to lowercase & underscore
class name, e.g. MyPageSet should be stored as my_page_set.py.

### Choosing a bucket

Telemetry has three Cloud Storage buckets you can put page sets in.

*   `page_set.PUBLIC_BUCKET == 'chromium-telemetry'`
*   `page_set.PARTNER_BUCKET == 'chrome-partner-telemetry'`
*   `page_set.INTERNAL_BUCKET == 'chrome-telemetry'`

Google wants to avoid legal issues with distributing third-party content, so to
be safe, **most recordings of websites on the public web go in
`PARTNER_BUCKET`**, which is accessible by Googlers and certain Google partners.
Recordings of Google-properties on the public web can go in `PUBLIC_BUCKET`, and
recordings of unreleased or internal Google websites go in `INTERNAL_BUCKET`.

## Record a page set or benchmark

Use the `record_wpr` script to record a page set or benchmark (preferred). Your
command will look something like this:

```none
src$ tools/perf/record_wpr --browser=(release|system) <page_set_name or benchmark name>
```

For example, to record the top25_smooth.py page set, specify
top25_smooth_page_set:

```none
src$ tools/perf/record_wpr --browser=system top25_smooth_page_set
```

To update the recording for only some pages in the page set, use
`--story-filter`. This command will record only Wikipedia pages:

```none
src$ tools/perf/record_wpr --browser=system --story-filter=wikipedia top25_smooth_page_set
```

`record_wpr` generates a few files:

*   A `.wpr` file containing the recorded data. This file is hidden from
            `git status`, which we'll explain next.
*   A `.wpr.sha1` file containing the SHA1 hash of the `.wpr` file.
*   A `.json` file containing metadata about which `.wpr` files store
            which URLs.

## Upload the recording to Cloud Storage

To avoid bloating everyone's Chromium checkouts, we avoid committing the large
`.wpr` files to source control. Instead, we upload them to Cloud Storage and
download them as needed. If you just want to use your recording locally, you can
skip this step.

If you haven't already, you may need to [set up Cloud
Storage](/developers/telemetry/upload_to_cloud_storage).

To do this, check in only the `.sha1` and `.json` files. When you run `git cl
upload`, a `PRESUBMIT` script will check whether you have already uploaded the
recording to Cloud Storage.

To upload your new recording to cloud storage, use the following command, as
referenced in the presubmit warning:

<pre><code>src$ depot_tools/upload_to_google_storage.py --bucket (chromium-telemetry|chrome-partner-telemetry|chrome-telemetry) tools/perf/page_sets/data/<b>my_page_set_000</b>.wpr 
</code></pre>

### Moving recordings between Cloud Storage buckets

Sometimes the addition or removal of pages changes the permission of the page
set, or the page set archives are in the wrong bucket. To move files between
buckets, use this command:

<pre><code>src$ tools/telemetry/cloud_storage mv tools/perf/page_sets/data/<b>my_page_set</b>_*.wpr (public|partner|google-only)
</code></pre>

## What is Web Page Replay?

Web Page Replay is a service that allows us to capture and store HTTP requests
and responses.
