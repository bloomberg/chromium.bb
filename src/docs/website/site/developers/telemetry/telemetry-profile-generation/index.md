By default, Telemetry runs all benchmarks in a fresh, clean profile. This isn't
always desirable for benchmarking. To run with other types of profiles, use
either --profile-type or --profile-dir.

**--profile-type=**

*   clean (default behavior) -- a clean, new profile. Note that
            benchmarks may include initialization routines that only happen on
            the first run.
*   default -- the default profile associated with the browser. As far
            as Telemetry is concerned, this is a non-deterministic state.
*   typical_user -- a pre-recorded profile that represents a typical
            user's profile. Note that benchmarks may include profile upgrade
            routines.
*   power_user -- a pre-recorded profile that represents a power user's
            profile. Note that benchmarks may include profile upgrade routines.

**--profile-dir=**

> A path to a profile to use. This is useful with generated profiles.

### Generated profiles

Because the canned profile-types may exhibit unrealistic behavior in benchmarks
(due to profile initialization or update routines), it is useful to be able to
generate a deterministic profile for benchmarking. To do so:

> $ tools/perf/generate_profile --profile-type-to-generate=&lt;PROFILE_TYPE&gt;
> --output-dir=/path/to/output/profile

**&lt;PROFILE_TYPE&gt;** may be small_profile, theme_profile or
many_extensions_profile.

Generated profile output directories should then be passed to --profile-dir. For
example, to run the session_restore benchmark:

> $ tools/perf/generate_profile --profile-type-to-generate=small_profile
> --output-dir=out/Release/generated_profile

> $ tools/perf/run_benchmark
> --profile-dir=out/Release/generated_profile/small_profile
> session_restore.cold.typical_25

Profile generation is in the process of being updated to generate more realistic
profiles. This is still a work in progress. To try it out, run:

$ tools/perf/generate_profile --profile-type-to-generate=large_profile
--browser=exact --browser-executable={path_to_executable} --use-live-sites
--output-dir=/path/to/output/profile
