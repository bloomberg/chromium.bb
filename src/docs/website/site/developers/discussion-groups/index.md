You can subscribe to the following groups to get project updates and discuss the
Chromium projects, and to get help in developing for Chromium-based browsers:

[chromium-discuss](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-discuss)

General Chromium discussion, ideas and suggestions should go here. This is a
high-volume mailing list, and in general is the right list to post to as a
default if you are unsure of exactly where you should post. Topical posts
include items such as ideas for new features or the improvement of existing
features, questions or comments around the high level design of Chromium, and
other high-level topics that are not necessarily focused on the actual
engineering or implementation of code.

**[chromium-os-discuss](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-os-discuss)**

This is the main group for discussing the Chromium OS project. Use this list to
discuss ideas for new features, how to improve existing features, the high-level
design of Chromium OS, and other topics that are not focused on the actual
engineering or implementation of code.

**[chromium-extensions](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-extensions)**

This group is for people who are creating extensions for Chromium or Google
Chrome.

**[chromium-apps](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-apps)**

This group is for people who are creating installable web apps for Chromium or
Google Chrome.

**[chromium-HTML5](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-html5/)**

This is the group to help with questions about how to use these new APIs from
HTML5 (and other standards groups) that are now available for use within
Chromium and Google Chrome, the extensions framework and Google Chrome OS.

[**chromium-accessibility**](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/group/chromium-accessibility)

This group is for discussing compatibility and use of Chromium or Google Chrome
with assistive technology such as screen readers.

Posts before that date for the above lists are available at
[chromium-discuss](https://groups.google.com/group/chromium-discuss),
[chromium-os-discuss](https://groups.google.com/group/chromium-os-discuss), and
[chromium-extensions](https://groups.google.com/group/chromium-extensions).*
