Currently, accessibility of Chromium on desktop Linux is not really supported.
However, there is a medium-term plan to solve this - please contact
[dmazzoni@chromium.org](mailto:dmazzoni@chromium.org) if you'd like more
information. Our goal is for all users to have an excellent experience, and we
have a plan that will make everything work great while minimizing the extra
effort required by Chromium developers.

### Linux assistive technology

The accessibility interface on Linux is the [GNOME Accessibility ToolKit
(ATK)](http://developer.gnome.org/atk/). After enabling accessibility support in
the GNOME Preferences (in Ubuntu, check System -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Assistive
Technologies), you can check Chrome's support using
[accerciser](http://live.gnome.org/Accerciser).
