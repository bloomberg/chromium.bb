## Introduction

### (EVERYONE) To get access to the Chromium Gerrit instance

1.  Go to <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/new-password>
2.  Log in with the email you use for your git commits.
    *   **If you are a Googler, make sure you're using the account you
                want to use (either @google.com or @chromium.org, depending on
                how you want to use things).**
    *   **You can verify this by ensuring that the Username field looks
                like git-&lt;user&gt;.chromium.org**
3.  Follow the directions on the new-password page to set up/append to
            your .gitcookies file.
    *   You should click the radio button labeled "only
                chromium.googlesource.com" if it exists.
4.  **Verification:** Run `git ls-remote
            https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/manifest.git`
    *   This should **not** prompt for any credentials, and should just
                print out a list of git references.
5.  Make sure to set your real name.
    1.  Visit <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/settings/> and
                check the "Full Name" field.

### (EVERYONE) Configure local checkouts for your account

Now that you've configured your account on the server, you should configure your
local checkouts.

1.  Run ``cd src && git config --local gerrit.host true` `` to default
            to uploading your reviews to Gerrit.

### (Googler) Link @chromium.org & @google.com accounts

If you have both @chromium.org and @google.com accounts, you may want to link
them. Doing so may make it easier to view all of your CLs at once, and may make
it less likely that you'll upload a CL with the wrong account.

However, if you do choose to link them, you will be prompted to log in using
**only** your @google.com account, and that means you have to follow all of the
normal security restrictions for such accounts.

**To link them:**

==If you have two email accounts== (@chromium.org and @google.com) but only have
one Gerrit account you can link them yourself:

1.  Login into <https://chromium-review.googlesource.com> using your
            @chromium.org account.
2.  Go to [Settings -&gt; Email
            Addresses](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/settings/EmailAddresses).
3.  In the "New email address" field, enter your @google.com account,
            click the Send Verification button, and follow the instructions.
    1.  If you see an error on clicking the link, use this link to file
                a ticket
                [go/fix-chrome-git](http://goto.google.com/fix-chrome-git)
4.  To verify that it worked, open [Settings -&gt;
            Identities](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/#/settings/web-identities)
            and verify your @chromium.org, @google.com and ldapuser/\*
            identities are listed.
5.  Repeat 1-4 on <https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com>, but
            use your @google.com email to login, and @chromium.org in "Register
            new email" dialog.
6.  If you see any errors during this process, file a [Infra-Git
            ticket](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Infra-Git)
            with the subject "Link my &lt;id&gt;@chromium.org and
            &lt;id&gt;@google.com accounts". If it is urgent, email
            ajp@chromium.org. Otherwise, the request should be handled within
            2-3 days.

==If you have two Gerrit accounts== you need an admin to link them. File a
[Infra-Git
ticket](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Infra-Git)
with the subject "Link my &lt;id&gt;@chromium.org and &lt;id&gt;@google.com
accounts". If it is urgent, email ajp@chromium.org. Otherwise, the request
should be handled within 2-3 days.

Once your accounts are linked, you'll be able to use both @chromium.org and
@google.com emails in git commits. It is particularly useful if you have your
@chromium.org email in global git config, and you try to trigger chrome-internal
trybots (that otherwise require @google.com email).

**Please note** that linking your accounts does NOT change ownership of CLs
you've already uploaded and you will **lose edit access** to any CLs owned by
your secondary (@google.com) account. i.e CLs you uploaded with your @google.com
account, before the link, will not show up in your @chromium.org dashboard. You
will have to re-upload in-flight changes and, for old closed changes, you can
set the assignee to your @chromium.org to make them visible in your linked
account dashboard. We don't recommend linking accounts when you significant
in-flight changes.

If you have linked accounts, and want to unlink them:

*   On chromium-review, go to
            https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/settings/#EmailAddresses,
            click "Delete" on all addresses associated with the account you
            don't want to use anymore (e.g. all the @google ones), and then sign
            in again using the account you do want to use (e.g. their @chromium
            one).
*   On chrome-internal-review, go to
            https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/settings/#EmailAddresses
            and do the same (probably deleting @chromium, and then signing in
            with your @google account).

If you see any errors during this process, file [Infra-Git
ticket](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Infra-Git)
with the subject "Unlink my &lt;id&gt;@chromium.org and &lt;id&gt;@google.com
accounts". If it is urgent, email ajp@chromium.org. Otherwise, the request
should be handled within 2-3 days.

## Watching Projects / Notifications

You can select Projects (and branches) you want to "watch" for any changes on by
adding the Project under [Settings -&gt;
Notifications](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/settings/#Notifications).

## How do I build on other ongoing Gerrit reviews?

Scenario: You have an ongoing Gerrit review, with issue number 123456 (this is
the number after the last / in the URL for your Gerrit review). You have a local
branch, with your change, say 2a40ae.

Someone else has an ongoing Gerrit review, with issue number 456789. You want to
build on this. Hereâ€™s one way to do it:

> git checkout -b their_branch

> git cl patch -f 456789

> git checkout -b my_branch # yes, create a new

> git cherry-pick 2a40ae # your change from local branch

> git branch --set-upstream-to=their_branch

> git rebase

> git cl issue 123456

> &lt;any more changes to your commit(s)&gt;

> git cl upload

## Not getting email?

In case you think you should be receiving email from Gerrit but don't see it in
your inbox, be sure to check your spam folder. It's possible that your mail
reader is mis-classifying email from Gerrit as spam.

## Still having a problem?

Check out the [Gerrit
Documentation](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/index.html)
to see if there are hints in there.

If you have any problems please [open a Build Infrastructure
issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/entry?template=Build+Infrastructure)
on the **Chromium** issue tracker (the "Build Infrastructure" template should be
automatically selected).

For additional information, you can also visit the [PolyGerrit + Chromium
FAQ](https://polygerrit.appspot.com/).
