title: Meet the Web Platform Companion Guide
---

# **Last updated 3/13/12**

The web platform is composed of a large collection of interoperable standards
that represent a solid foundation for building powerful apps. New standards are
born on the cutting edge, where various organizations experiment with new
capabilities. Those capabilities that capture the imagination of the broader
community may eventually become a formal part of the web platform.
The demos in the [Meet the Web Platform
videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i4dtgh3ym0&list=PL0207724E1C9C22A6&feature=plpp_play_all)
show a few examples of some of the cool stuff you can do on the cutting edge of
the web platform. Not all of these capabilities have been standardized yet, some
only work in Chrome today, and some are still actively being implemented in
Chrome. This guide serves as a companion to the videos, providing more context
on each demo and the technology that powers them.

## Building on Foundations

### Web Components

*   Implementation status: Shadow DOM, a core foundational piece of Web
            Components, is available in Chrome 19+ behind the Shadow DOM flag.
            Other bits will be implemented in the near future.
*   Cross-browser support: Active interest demonstrated by Microsoft and
            Mozilla
*   Standardization status: All specifications under Web Components
            umbrella are being developed in the [W3C WebApps Working
            Group](http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/)
