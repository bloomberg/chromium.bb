Chrome OS sheriffing is to keep developers happy by keeping the tree green.

### Responsibilities

These threefold purposes apply to sheriffs:

*   Make sure tip-of-tree (ToT) breakages are identified and addressed
            in a timely fashion.
*   Manually watch over our build system in ways automation
            doesn‘t/can’t do.
    *   Post-submit builders
    *   *NEW* Release builders
