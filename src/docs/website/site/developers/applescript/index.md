JavaScript injection via AppleScript will soon be disabled by default in Chrome
stable. Weâ€™re making this change in order to protect users from injection of
unwanted content.

Users who need this functionality can re-enable it by going to the menu bar,
View &gt; Developer &gt; Allow JavaScript from Apple Events

Alternatively, applications that legitimately need to inject JavaScript into
Chrome can do so by publishing an[
extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) and using Native Messaging
to communicate with their application process. For more information, see[
https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/nativeMessaging](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/nativeMessaging)

For automation, developers can also use Telemetry:
