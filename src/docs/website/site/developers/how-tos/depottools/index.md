The [depot_tools
tutorial](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html)
walks through a few key scenarios like managing branches.

## Introduction

Chromium uses a package of scripts, the depot_tools, to manage interaction with
the Chromium source code repository and the Chromium development process. It
contains the following utilities:

*   gclient: Meta-checkout tool managing both subversion and git
            checkouts. It is similar to [repo
            tool](https://gerrit.googlesource.com/git-repo) except that it works
            on Linux, OS X, and Windows and supports both svn and git. On the
            other hand, gclient doesn't integrate any code review functionality.
*   **gcl**: [Rietveld](https://github.com/rietveld-codereview/rietveld)
            code review tool for *subversion*. The gcl tool runs [presubmit
            scripts](/developers/how-tos/depottools/presubmit-scripts).
*   **git-cl**:
            [Rietveld](https://github.com/rietveld-codereview/rietveld) code
            review tool for *git*. The git-cl tool runs [presubmit
            scripts](/developers/how-tos/depottools/presubmit-scripts).
*   **svn** \[Windows only\]: [subversion
            client](https://subversion.apache.org/) for Chromium development.
            (Executable Subversion binaries are included in the depot_tools on
            Windows systems as a convenience, so that working with Chromium
            source code does not require a separate Subversion download.)
*   **drover**: Quickly revert svn commits.
*   **cpplint.py**: Checks for C++ style compliance.
*   **pylint**: Checks for Python style compliance.
*   **presubmit_support.py**: Runs PRESUBMIT.py presubmit checks.
*   **repo**: The repo tool.
*   **wtf**: Displays the active git branches in a chromium os checkout.
*   **weekly**: Displays the log of checkins for a particular developer
            since a particular date for git checkouts.
*   **git-gs**: Wrapper for git grep with relevant source types.
*   **zsh-goodies**: Completion for zsh users.

It is highly encouraged to look around and open the files in a text editor as
this page can quickly become outdated.

Please keep ~~this page~~ the man pages updated!

## Installing

See the
[depot_tools_tutorial](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up)
for set-up instructions.

## Help!

These tools don't have man pages but have integrated help! Try all of these
commands! If the doc is not adequate, send patches to fix them.

*   gclient help
    *   It works for subcommands too like: gclient help sync
*   git-cl help
    *   It works for subcommands too like: git-cl help patch

Otherwise, there are
[many](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/app_notepad.mspx?mfr=true)
[great](https://www.vim.org/) [text](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
[editors](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) that can help you out to read what the
tools are actually doing.

## gclient

`gclient` is a python script to manage a workspace of modular dependencies that
are each checked out independently from different subversion or git
repositories. Features are:

*   Dependencies can be specified on a per-OS basis.
*   Dependencies can be specified relative to their parent dependency.
*   Variables can be used to abstract concepts.
*   Hooks can be specified to be run after a checkout.
*   .gclient and DEPS are python scripts, you can hack in easily or add
            additional configuration data.

### .gclient file

It's the primary file. It is, in fact, a python script. It specifies the
following variables:

*   **solutions**: an array of dictionaries specifying the projects that
            will be fetched.
*   **hooks**: additional hooks to be run when this meta checkout is
            synced.
*   **target_os**: an optional array of (target) operating systems to
            fetch OS-specific dependencies for.
*   **cache_dir**: Primarily for bots, multiple working sets use a
            single git cache. See [gclient.py
            --cache-dir](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/tools/depot_tools/gclient.py&sq=package:chromium&type=cs&q=%22parser.add_option('--cache-dir'%22&l=1865).

Additional variables are ignored.

Each project described in the solutions array can contain an optional DEPS file
that will be processed. The .gclient file is generated with `gclient config
<url>` or by hand. Each solutions entry is a dictionary that can contain the
following variables:

*   **name**: really, the path of the checkout.
*   **url**: the remote repository to fetch/clone.
*   **custom_deps**: (optional) override the dependencies specified in
            the deps and deps_os variables in child DEPS files. Useful when you
            want to fetch a writable checkout instead of the default read-only
            checkout of a dependency, e.g. you work on native_client from a
            chromium checkout.
*   **custom_vars**: (optional) override the variables defined in vars
            in child DEPS files. Example: override the WebKit version used for a
            chromium checkout.
*   **safesync_url**: (optional) url to fetch to retrieve the revision
            to sync this checkout to.

### DEPS file

A DEPS file specifies dependencies of a project. It is in fact a python script.
It specifies the following variables:

*   **deps**: a dictionary of child dependencies to fetch.
*   **deps_os**: a dictionary of OSes for OS-specific dependencies, each
            containing a dictionary of child dependencies to fetch.
*   **vars**: a dictionary of variables to define. Mainly useful to
            easily override a batch of revisions at once.
*   **hooks**: hooks to run after a sync.
*   **use_relative_paths**: relative paths should specify the checkout
            relative to this directory instead of the root gclient checkout.

Additional variables are ignored. Special keywords are:

*   **File()**: used for dependencies, specify to expect to checkout a
            file instead of a directory.
*   **From()**: used to fetch a dependency definition from another DEPS
            file, for chaining.
*   **Var()**: replace this string with a variable defined in vars or
            overridden.

### Pinned deps

Each dependency checkout URL can (and usually does) contain a revision number or
git hash, which means you're going to check out and build from that specific
revision of the module in question. We call that **pinned deps**. The advantage
is that you can build from a known working revision, even if it comes from a
completely different SCM repository or going back in time. The drawback is you
have to update the revision number(s) constantly, what we call **deps rolls**.

### DEPS examples

Chromium's
[src/DEPS](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/DEPS) is a
fairly complex example that will show all the possibilities of a DEPS file.

## Sending patches

[Contributing code](/developers/contributing-code) is done the same way as in
other Chromium repositories.

## Disabling auto update

The `gclient` and `git-cl` scripts are actually wrapper scripts that will, by
default, always update the `depot_tools` to the latest versions of the tools
checked in at
<https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git>. If for some
reason you wish to disable this auto-update behavior, either:

*   Set the environment variable `DEPOT_TOOLS_UPDATE=0`.
*   Remove `depot_tools/.git`. This may be appropriate if you choose to
            install depot_tools in a common location for use by multiple users
            (for example, `/usr/local/bin` on a Linux system).

Note: If you aren't using either of these helper scripts (e.g. you're developing
Chromium OS), then you will need to manually update depot_tools yourself from
time to time with a simple: git pull

### Caveat

Chromium engineers expect the auto-updating behavior of depot_tools, checkout or
presubmit breakage may ensue.
