title: Graphics Debugging in Visual Studio 2013
---

Visual Studio 2013 has a built-in graphics debugger that can capture a rendered
frame. This is a replacement for PIX.

To use it with Chromium:

*   Pass the command arguments: --no-sandbox --in-process-gpu
    *   To enable gpu rasterization, include the command line arguments:
                --force-gpu-rasterization --enable-impl-side-painting
    *   You might need following hack or something
    diff --git a/content/app/content_main_runner.cc b/content/app/content_main_runner.cc index 05e45bd..46db961 100644 --- a/content/app/content_main_runner.cc +++ b/content/app/content_main_runner.cc @@ -401,6 +401,11 @@ int RunNamedProcessTypeMain( { switches::kGpuProcess, GpuMain }, #endif // !CHROME_MULTIPLE_DLL_BROWSER }; + base::CommandLine& command_line = + \*base::CommandLine::ForCurrentProcess(); + command_line.AppendSwitch(switches::kInProcessGPU); + command_line.AppendSwitch(switches::kNoSandbox);
*   Within Visual Studio, show the Graphics toolbar
*   Click File&gt;Open&gt;Project/Solution, and then click your
            chrome.exe FYI, release build chrome.exe/content_shell.exe works
            well.
*   Click the "Start Diagnostics" button on the Graphics toolbar
*   While hardware accelerated graphics are being rendered within
            Chromium, press the Print Scrn key, or the "Capture Next Rendered
            Frame" button on the Graphics toolbar

Each frame time will be super imposed on top of Chrome. If you don't see this
then the Graphics Debugger is not working correctly and you won't be able to
capture frames.

Here is a description of some of the more important elements of the Graphic
Debugger (numbers correspond to the highlighted part on the above image):

1.  The Graphic toolbar
2.  The *Graphic Event List* pane keeps a complete history of the calls
            to create the frame. Clicking through the list will generate a
            preview of the frame up to the call that you have selected in the
            .vsglog frame in the center.
3.  Within the event list, you can find objects that were created by or
            used in a function call
4.  The *Graphics Object Table* contains a list of all objects used
            during the frame
5.  The name of an object is set within the chrome source. For example,
            if you search for "Offscreen back buffer texture", you will find it
            in the function "SwapChain11::resetOffscreenTexture"
6.  Some calls within the *Graphics Event List* will give you a call
            stack (usually, you must click directly on a DirectX function to get
            a call stack)
7.  If you double click an object in the *Graphics Object Table*, you
            can get details on the object. If it is a texture, it will open and
            display the texture
8.  If you double click on a shader in the *Graphics Object Table*, you
            can open a temporary file that shows the shader code

You may find it useful to use the configuration manager within Visual Studio to
create multiple debug targets. For example, you can set up a second
configuration to pass the gpu specific flags.
