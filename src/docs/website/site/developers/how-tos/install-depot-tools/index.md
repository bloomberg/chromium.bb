Chromium and Chromium OS use a package of scripts called
[**depot_tools**](/developers/how-tos/depottools) to manage checkouts and code
reviews.

The depot_tools package includes `gclient`, `gcl`, `git-cl`, `repo`, and others.

View the [**updated depot_tools set-up documentation** in the depot_tools
tutorial](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools_tutorial.html#_setting_up).
Then continue with the tutorial or [see the depot_tools
documentation](https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chrome-infra-docs/flat/depot_tools/docs/html/depot_tools.html)
for usage. These same docs are also available as man pages.
