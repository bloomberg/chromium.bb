title: Status Update Email Best Practices
---

### General suggestions

*   Send to list with +status, e.g. blink-dev+status@chromium.org
*   Minimize boilerplate subject line.
*   Summarize highlights in subject, or as the first line of the email.
*   Main content follows as a bullet list of key status updates.
*   Every 2 weeks works well for many projects. Adjust as appropriate
            given the news of an update.
*   For feature status updates, link the feature on
            [chromestatus.com](http://chromestatus.com).
*   Optimize for skimmability.
