The following are typical paths taken during a file download.

The start sequence shows what happens after the headers have been received in
response to an HTTP request for a file.

This sequence shows what happens when the file has finished downloading:

Complete

This sequence shows what happens when the user resumes a download that has been
paused:

Unpause

This following sequences have not been checked in yet.

This sequence shows what should happen when an error occurs during a file
download.

Note that currently, the "Complete" sequence is executed in this case, so the
file appears to have downloaded properly but is in fact incomplete.

Interrupted

This shows how a sequence would be restarted after an interruption (error)
occurs.

It basically sends a new request for the remainder of the data, and appends it
to the existing partial file.
