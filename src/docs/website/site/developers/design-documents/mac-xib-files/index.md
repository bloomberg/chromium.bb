title: Mac XIB Files
---

Cocoa interfaces are typically [created using Xcode's Interface
Builder](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LoadingResources/CocoaNibs/CocoaNibs.html).
The output of that program produces XIB files, which are XML representations of
a user interface.

**Chromium does not use XIB files. Do not add new ones.**
