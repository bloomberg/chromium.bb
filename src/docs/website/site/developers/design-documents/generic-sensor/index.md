# Objective

This document explains how sensor APIs (such as Ambient Light Sensor,
Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer) based on Generic Sensor API are
implemented in Chromium. This document describes the Generic Sensor API
implementation on both renderer process and browser process sides, it also
describes important implementation details, for example how data from a single
platform sensor is distributed among multiple JS sensor instances and how sensor
configurations are managed.

At the time of writing following specifications were implemented in Chromium
under “Generic Sensor” feature flag.

ED Specs:

Generic Sensor API <https://w3c.github.io/sensors/>

Ambient Light Sensor API <https://w3c.github.io/ambient-light/>

Accelerometer Sensor API <https://w3c.github.io/accelerometer/>

Gyroscope Sensor API <https://w3c.github.io/gyroscope/>

Magnetometer Sensor API <https://w3c.github.io/magnetometer/>

Absolute Orientation Sensor API <https://w3c.github.io/orientation-sensor/>

# Background

The Generic Sensor API defines base interfaces that should be implemented by
concrete sensors. In most of the cases, concrete sensors should only define
sensor specific data structures and if required, sensor configuration options.
Same approach is applied on the implementation side: Generic Sensor API
implementation (we call it Generic Sensor Framework or GSF) provides the common
functionality that is reused by concrete sensor implementations, its goal is to
decrease to a minimum the amount of code required for implementation of a new
sensor type.

    Generic Sensor Framework requirements

    Share the crucial parts of functionality between the concrete sensor
    implementations.

Avoid the code duplication and thus simplify maintenance and development of new
features.

    Support simultaneous existence and functioning of multiple JS Sensor
    instances of the same type that can have different configurations and
    life-time.

    Support for both “slow” sensors that provide periodic updates (e.g.
    AmbientLight, Proximity), and “fast” streaming sensors that have low-latency
    requirements for sensor reading updates (motion sensors).

# Overview/Scope

The GSF implementation consists of two main components: Sensor module in Blink
(located at
[third_party/WebKit/Source/](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/third_party/WebKit/Source/modules/sensor)[modules/sensor](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/third_party/WebKit/Source/modules/sensor))
which contains JS bindings for Generic Sensor API and concrete sensors APIs, and
‘generic_sensor’ component (located at
[services/device/generic_sensor/](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/services/device/generic_sensor/))
- a set of classes living on Browser process side that eventually call system
API to access the actual device sensors.

The ‘generic_sensor’ component exposes following mojo interfaces for
communication with JS bindings:

    [SensorProvider](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/device/generic_sensor/public/interfaces/sensor_provider.mojom?l=33)
    is a “factory like” interface that provides data about the sensors present
    on the device and their capabilities (reporting mode, maximum sampling
    frequency).

    [Sensor](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/device/generic_sensor/public/interfaces/sensor.mojom?l=42)
    is an interface wrapping a concrete device sensor. JS bindings code uses it
    to start polling the device sensor with the configurations obtained from JS.

    [SensorClient](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/device/generic_sensor/public/interfaces/sensor.mojom?l=80)
    is implemented by JS bindings code to be notified about errors occurred on
    platform side and about sensor reading updates for sensors with ‘onchange’
    reporting mode.

Please note, that the fetched sensor data is not passed to JS bindings via mojo
calls - shared memory buffer is used instead, thus we obviate bloating of mojo
IPC channel with sensor data (for sensors with continuous reporting mode) when
platform sensor has high sampling frequency and also avoid bringing of an extra
latency.

GSF component diagram is shown on figure below:

# Detailed Design

## Generic sensor component

The class diagram of Generic Sensor device component is shown below. All classes
act on IO thread, except if documented otherwise.

<img alt="image"
src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Dvff-Ry2p4OwE-6KKcvQaZR0hZqTkiiYSUFAlxKFyU8hhcX9qHZMxKRunk-wxPBA9hn4ctdK3IovGkFU4_gg6CafhLuXV2lDVNiPopwIqhW2gGWvnTEy7ZCiwuy76Ws-UahRyon-"

height=661 width=814>

PlatformSensorProvider is a singleton class, its main functionality is creating
and tracking PlatformSensor instances. PlatformSensorProvider is also
responsible for creating a shared buffer for sensor readings. Every platform has
its own implementation of PlatformSensorProvider (PlatformSensorProviderAndroid,
PlatformSensorProviderWin, ...), generic part of the functionality is
encapsulated inside the inherited PlatformSensorProviderBase class.

PlatformSensor represents device sensor of a given type, there can be only one
PlatformSensor instance of the same type at the time, its ownership is shared
between existing SensorImpl instances. PlatformSensor is an abstract class which
encapsulates generic functionality and is inherited by the platform-specific
implementations (PlatformSensorAndroid, PlatformSensorWin, ...).

SensorImpl class implements the exposed Sensor mojo interface and forwards IPC
calls to the owned PlatformSensor instance. SensorImpl implements
PlatformSensor::Client interface to receive notifications from PlatformSensor.

SensorProviderImpl class implements the exposed SensorProvider mojo interface
and forwards IPC calls to the PlatformSensorProvider singleton instance.

## Sensor module in Bink

Blink side class diagram is shown below.

<img alt="sensor_blink.png"
src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/zJkWjhDxivcT-LPfjxkM9G8b5JvW0mtGzBpIOiHMBIcrA-p6uJyospc7JaBL6ZbyRmC40lhVwzWVUWGeR10srHGxAAdFb59Kr-8JxocnlhNwZKmeBo9vZBVU8PZ64MQgbTXfP3lf4HltKvTf2g"
height=627 width=807>

Sensor - implements bindings for the
[Sensor](https://w3c.github.io/sensors/#the-sensor-interface) interface. All
classes that implement concrete sensor interfaces (such as AmbientLightSensor,
Gyroscope, Accelerometer) must be inherited from it.

SensorReading - implements bindings for the
[SensorReading](https://w3c.github.io/sensors/#the-sensor-reading-interface) IDL
interface. All classes that implement concrete sensor reading interfaces (e.g.
GyroscopeReading) must be inherited from it.

SensorProxy wraps the mojom::Sensor mojo interface proxy and itself implements
mojom::SensorClient interface. It provides nested SensorProxy::Observer
interface which is inherited by Sensor class in order to receive notification
from platform side.

SensorProxy contains the SensorReading instance which is shared between all
Sensor instances inside the frame.

Inside a frame there can be only one SensorProxy instance for a concrete sensor
type (i.e. ambient light, accelerometer) at the time and its ownership is shared
between Sensor instances. SensorProxy instance is created at first
Sensor.start() method call and destroyed when there are no more active Sensor
instances left.

SensorProviderProxy wraps 'SensorProvider' mojo interface proxy and manages
'SensorProxy' instances. Sensor implementation obtains SensorProviderProxy
instance as a LocalFrame supplement and uses it to the get SensorProxy instance
for the needed type.

SensorReadingUpdater abstract class (and its implementations
SensorReadingUpdaterOnChange and SensorReadingUpdaterContinuous) encapsulates
the logic for sending 'onchange' event which depends on sensor's reporting mode.

## Sensor shared buffer

Sensor shared buffer is used to transfer sensor readings from browser process to
renderer process. Read-write operations are synchronized via seqlock mechanism.

GSF uses a single shared memory buffer which is divided into chunks - sensor
reading buffers, one chunk per sensor type. Every sensor reading buffer contains
6 tightly packed 64-bit floating fields: { seqlock, timestamp, sensor reading 1,
sensor reading 2, sensor reading 3, sensor reading 4 }, so it has fixed size 6
\* 8 = 48 bytes.

Please see
[sensor_reading.h](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/services/device/public/cpp/generic_sensor/sensor_reading.h)
for more details.

## Sensor configurations management

This paragraph describes the implementation of logic behind
[Sensor.reading](https://w3c.github.io/sensors/#sensor-reading) update and
sending of [Sensor.onchange](https://w3c.github.io/sensors/#sensor-onchange)
event. The issue here is that relationship between device sensor and
corresponding JS sensor instances is one-to-many, and each JS sensor instance
may have different configuration.

In GSF the resulting configuration which is applied to the device sensor is the
highest from the currently existing JS sensors configurations. The following
object diagram illustrates these logic with example of four sensor instances of
the same type and they have different sampling frequencies: 1Hz, 50Hz, 10Hz,
20Hz.

The maximum sampling frequency used is 50 Hz and PlatformSensor updates shared
buffer using this frequency. <img alt="image"
src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/3/d/seLUCG5qYsxSM0B-2rqap5A/image?w=652&h=488&rev=61&ac=1&parent=1Ml65ZdW5AgIsZTszk4mD_ohr40pcrdVFOIf0ZtWxDv0"
height=488 width=652>

Note: the given sampling frequency value is capped to 60 Hz for security
reasons, that are explained in “Security and Privacy” section of this document.

On platform side (in generic_sensor component) sensor configurations are managed
inside PlatformSensor class.

On Blink side, for ‘continuous’ reporting mode, SensorProxy continuously updates
the stored reading instance from shared buffer using periodic timer and then
notifies all dependent Sensor instances that sensor reading has changed.
Further, Sensor instance may send ‘onchange’ event considering its own frequency
and based on the timestamp delta between the newly arrived reading and the one
that had been previously send.

For ‘onchange’ reporting mode the behavior is a bit different: SensorProxy
updates reading from shared buffer, however, unlike the ‘continuous’ reporting
mode case, it does not do it all the time. Reading updates start after
‘SensorReadingChanged()’ mojo call and continue for the period of time equal to

T= 1÷Fmin

where Fmin is the minimal sampling frequency from the currently present Sensor
instances, in the example above it would be 1÷1Hz =1s.

# Platform Implementation details

## Implementation on Android

<img alt="generic_sensors_android.png"
src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XscvEjpOvW8ZMteqph3E2lG-KTxxyU-H_ep2YpZ62yOlzf2trcGkRLzZ9-CWDSfJKX5m2rUIXyF6xwNX9iQvDBN-MupNuLli20VRAeMKxJ52plpDgCHaNZJP54HPRDz35XAksyylyvzEgTytew"
height=504 width=796>

The adaptation for Android platform consists of two parts, native (C++) and
java. Native adaptation includes PlatformSensorProviderAndroid and
PlatformSensorAndroid C++ classes, while java counterpart consists of
PlatformSensorProvider and PlatformSensor java classes that are included in
org.chromium.device.sensors package. Java classes interface with Android Sensor
API to fetch reading from device sensors. Native side and java classes
communicate with each other over JNI interface.

The PlatformSensorProviderAndroid class implements PlatformSensorProvider
interface and responsible for creation of PlatformSensorProvider instance over
JNI, when java object is created, all sensor creation requests are forwarded to
java object.

The PlatformSensorAndroid class implements PlatformSensor interface, owns
PlatformSensor java object and forwards start, stop and other requests to it.

The PlatformSensorProvider java object is responsible for thread management, and
PlatformSensor creation, it also owns Android SensorManager object that is
accessed by PlatformSensor java objects.

The PlatformSensor java object implements SensorEventListener interface and owns
Android Sensor object. The PlatformSensor adds itself as a event listener for a
Sensor to receive sensor reading updates and forwards them to native side using
native\* methods.

## Implementation on Windows

<img alt="generic_sensors_win.png"
src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/piQ76AtNgH95JBmYvq39nQHVuHKtn8IwtxBduY3kHFlCSZk_27Oh8xGpQ7O0B7IfAsRwVb9-nHJDU3K0hV19UDl4ZRzj9H_iCTMOpCKev_NjEEZX0cxmtMel6KLngN8f49sJmWgRvyMMNWZrkA"
height=496 width=816>

The adaptation layer for Generic Sensors on Windows platform uses Windows Sensor
API that provides COM interfaces to interact with platform sensors. The
adaptation consists of three main classes: PlatformSensorProviderWin,
PlatformSensorWin and PlatformSensorReaderWin.

All Windows Sensor API COM objects and PlatformSensorReaderWin are created on
sensors thread, while PlatformSensorProviderWin and PlatformSensorWin live on
IPC thread and communicate with Generic Sensor API mojo interfaces.

The PlatformSensorProviderWin implements PlatformSensorProvider interface, it is
responsible for creation of PlatformSensorWin and PlatformSensorReaderWin
instances. It also manages COM object ISensorManager and sensor thread where all
COM objects are created.

The PlatformSensorReaderWin communicates with ISensor interface to configure it
and get readings from ISensor COM object. The EventListener class implements
ISensorEvents interface to get notifications about sensor state changes and
delivers sensor readings to parent class PlatformSensorReaderWin that in turn,
forwards sensor readings to PlatformSensorWin through
PlatformSensorReaderWin::Client interface that is implemented by
PlatformSensorWin.

The PlatformSensorWin implements PlatformSensor and controls
PlatformSensorReaderWin state using StartSensor() and StopSensor() methods.
Implements PlatformSensorReaderWin::Client interface to receive notifications
about new readings or error conditions.

## Implementation on Chrome OS and Linux

ChromeOS (CrOS) and Linux Operating Systems (OS) share the same code base except
for some auxiliary data structures, which are used to read sensor values in a
right order and in accordance to Generic Sensor API specifications, and
functions, which are used to apply scaling value, offset value and other values
to keep readings in single units of measurement.

Sensor data is read using Industrial Input/Output (IIO) APIs. There are two ways
to read data:

    Using sysfs paths.

    Using device node interface.

Our implementation is using sysfs for both CrOS and Linux platforms. The problem
with the device node interface is that it requires device nodes to be accessible
not only by root but by a user without root rights, who runs Chromium or Chrome
browser. While the mentioned problem concerns only Linux distributions, CrOS
involves another problem - data cannot be read by multiple clients
simultaneously, which is true for Linux platform as well. As far as we know,
there is an AccelerometerReader that uses this interface to read accelerometer
data for CrOS specific components in the browser. To be more precise, the
interface uses a ring buffer, whose values are erased after reading happens or
buffer is full. If there are two simultaneous clients trying to read from the
same buffer, both of them will miss data which will cause performance and
reliability issues. There is a new feature in the latest kernel - two and more
simultaneous reads can be done for the same device node interface, but this
feature is still in staging.

The implementation on CrOS and Linux involves several classes - a
PlatformSensorProviderLinux, derived from a PlatformSensorProvider, a
PlatformSensorLinux derived from a PlatformSensor, a SensorDeviceManager and a
SensorReader, which is a base class for a PollingSensorReader.

<img alt="image"
src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/u/3/d/sRFxDJyPPjE85FLZKbmQGCg/image?w=579&h=65&rev=1&ac=1&parent=1Ml65ZdW5AgIsZTszk4mD_ohr40pcrdVFOIf0ZtWxDv0"
height=65 width=579><img alt="generic_base.png"

height=740 width=803>

PlatformSensorProviderLinux is a singleton class that processes requests for new
sensors. It uses composition and holds a unique pointer to a SensorDeviceManager
object, which sends notifications about added and removed iio sensors back to it
using a Delegate pattern. The PlatformSensorProviderLinux has a SensorDeviceMap
cache, which is an unordered map that stores a pair of a mojom::SensorType key
and a std::unique_ptr&lt;SensorInfoLinux&gt; structure, which represents a
structure of an existing iio device. The structure’s members will be discussed
further along with the implementation of the SensorDeviceManager.

The SensorDeviceMap is a cache, which is used to store type to structure pairs
of all known IIO sensors provided by an OS and is used to create sensors of
requested types. When a request for a specific type of sensor comes
(PlatformSensorProviderLinux::CreateSensorInternal is called), the provider
checks if the SensorDeviceManager has been started and enumeration has been
done. If not, the provider starts the manager and waits until it enumerates all
iio devices available to create PlatformSensorLinux sensors asynchronously,
otherwise the provider checks if it has a SensorInfoLinux for a specific sensor
type in its cache. Then it creates a platform sensor passing SensorInfoLinux to
it, which will use the structure to set own frequency, reporting mode and then
passes the structure to a SensorReader created by that sensor.

Once enumeration is done, the provider starts to process stored in
std::vector&lt;mojom::SensorType&gt; requests according their types by
enumerating own cache and looking for a SensorInfoLinux structure that
represents the requested type of a sensor.

As previously said, the PlatformSensorLinux creates a SensorReader and passes a
SensorInfoLinux structure to it. The reader has a static factory method
SensorReader::Create, which creates a PollingSensorReader (we will implement
triggered sensor reader, which will use the device node interface in the future
once all problems regarding this reading strategy are resolved). The reader uses
the SensorInfoLinux structure and stores sysfs paths, which are used to read iio
sensor values, offset value, scaling value and a functor -
SensorPathsLinux::ReaderFunctor, which is used to apply scaling and offset
values and invert signs if needed. A base::RepeatingTimer is used to instantiate
readings using a frequency provided by a PlatformSensorLinux.

SensorDeviceManager is a class that uses LinuxDeviceMonitor to enumerate
devices, listen to "add/removed" events and then notify the
PlatformSensorProviderLinux about added or removed IIO devices. It has own cache
to speed up an identification process of removed devices. The LinuxDeviceMonitor
is a class that listens for notifications from libudev about

connected/disconnected devices. When the manager is started, it adds itself as
an observer to the LinuxDeviceMonitor and asks to enumerate devices. During
enumeration, the provider gets notifications about found sensors and updates its
cache.

height=69 width=579>

## Chrome OS and Linux: threading model

The threading model differs from other Generic Sensor API’s platform
implementations. Three threads are used to preserve Chromium or Chrome fast and
responsive. Those are an I/O browser thread, a browser file thread and a custom
polling thread.

The PlatformSensorProviderLinux and PlatformSensorLinux use the I/O browser
thread and all the communications with another Generic Sensor framework code
happens there. The SensorDeviceManager uses the browser file thread and
communicates with the PlatformSensorProviderLinux using I/O thread’s task
runners. The polling thread is created and owned by the
PlatformSensorProviderLinux and stopped once there are no sensors left. The
provider passes the polling thread’s task runner to the PlatformSensorLinux,
which uses that to communicate with the SensorReader. The SensorReader is
created on a I/O thread, but detached in it’s constructor and attached to a
custom polling thread once it’s methods are called by the sensor.

## Implementation on macOS

The implementation for Mac platform consists of two classes:
PlatformSensorProviderMac (singleton) and PlatformSensorAmbientLightMac. The
reason of a precise naming of the sensor class is that the platform has only
ambient light sensors embedded into hardware.

PlatformSensorProviderMac implements PlatformSensorProvider’s interface and is
responsible for creation of PlatformSensorAmbientLightMac object. Both of them
live on I/O browser thread and communicate with the rest Generic Sensor API code
using mojo interfaces.

PlatformSensorAmbientLightMac utilizes IOKit to get information from the
platform and callback

when the value of the sensor is changed. In order to get a right callback
notification, IOServiceAddInterestNotification is used.

# Security and Privacy

Generic Sensor APIs can be only accessed by top-level secure browsing contexts.
Only focused browsing context is able to access sensor data. When browsing
context (tab) is unfocused, sensors that are associated with are stopped to
reduce power consumption and avoid exposing sensor data. Generic Sensors API
specification addresses security and privacy in chapter [5. Security and Privacy
considerations.](https://w3c.github.io/sensors/#security-and-privacy)

Generic Sensor implementation in Chromium is using Permission mojo service to
obtain permission from the user.

In order to avoid privacy information leakage, sensors that might expose privacy
sensitive data must be protected by permission system and maximum allowed
polling frequency should capped to complicate ‘gyrophone’ \[1\] or keylogger
\[2,3,4,5\] type of attacks.

The ambient light sensor is prone to keylogging attacks \[5\], therefore, must
have separate permission token, so that UA / web page is able to control access
to data provided by the sensor. The data could be rounded to its integer part
and only illuminance values returned to the users of the API without exposing
RGB data. Also, ambient light sensor might be used to track what end-user is
watching at the moment on the TV or tell whether user has moved from one room to
another.

The accelerometer and gyroscope sensors might be used for keylogger type of
attacks \[2,3,4\] or, for example, identify users by walking patterns,
therefore, must be protected by separate permission token.

The magnetometer sensor provides information about magnetic field and in theory,
can expose location of a user. For example, attack vector could be
pre-magnetized surface in a particular location, or mapping between location and
constant magnetic field disturbances caused by the building. Due to non-uniform
strength of the Earth’s magnetic field, another attack vector could be exposure
/ validation of user location. For example, if end-user is connected through
VPN, magnetic field associated with GEO IP information can be compared with
magnetometer readings at real location, therefore, tell whether user is using
VPN or not.

Orientation sensor that provides quaternion or rotation matrix data is a fusion
sensor that uses accelerometer, gyroscope and optionally magnetometer. It fuses
data from different sources, therefore, it is difficult to reconstruct original
data provided by low-level sensors. Research paper \[6\] indicates that
orientation sensors can be used for keylogger type of attacks.

To avoid out-of-band communication between different origins, actual polling
frequency is not exposed to JS objects.

Generic Sensor APIs functions the same in incognito and regular windows.

Discussion of past issues discovered in Blink’s Device Orientation and Motion
APIs is [here](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=598674), we
believe they are all addressed by the above mitigations.

## Sensor permissions considerations

Given the privacy and security risks described above the most sensitive data is
fetched from the low-level sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope in particular),
therefore access to these sensor interfaces is better to be protected with
permission mechanism.

## Chrome UI

The site settings UI could contain single option entry dedicated for sensors.
The user might forbid access, thus disabling sensors that are under ‘opt-out’
group. If the default permission policy for particular sensor is ‘ASK’ web page
could request permissions using Permission API, thus, triggering permission
dialog. Therefore, localized strings and possibly icons would be required for
the UI.

## Mock (opt-out) UI

### Simple site settings UI

<img alt="site_settings_mock.png"
src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/f6H63VF9pQtgw_SmljATMVK29aSIz3z7Ef6wWSaaWmq409W08-kFMreB4JjJqp7wSlIQU6e6AfDW1Ig6lHKIjIMshNt7qujaVRwXGzmYUgGHBZY-WpYMSPRQOATwXnZynPx9n7Xn"
height=574 width=390>

If “always block” is selected by the user, Chrome should (options):

    Block all sensors?

    Block particular set of sensors?

### Site settings UI with granular permission settings

<table>
<tr>
<td><img alt="granular_site_settings.png" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/dclZNraHc8sOwB7lJrl_6GDR8StPxP_vd8dFF8zbygXnMs27oL1R3hAaQU7TB0ALfJ_fBZlzOYlGgyz6jR9AD-AjRcOPPv-AEVCLAOJWtj1AH6x0PV7bScavi39FMFHNtBJ3ktjb" height=473 width=321></td>

<td># <img alt="granular_permissions.png" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/6Yytq5AuiJiHPFZO7lqqEu332lZAGhDt7waCUo6wbk-rYqEHs7zB8re_v74VxnFoa0UAXNyJsG9GQ3X51SVPO9f5RqyzypRmu9K8vFEfkbt08tvBZUatdonoWA9YpkoL1sZG235V" height=243 width=298></td>

</tr>
</table>

Pros:

    User is able to see what sensors are being used by the web page.

    Block all sensors or particular sensor in “granular” UI, similar to cookies.

Cons:

    Unclear whether this can be implemented on mobile devices, e.g., Android.
