### Overview

Chrome for Android uses certain resources in Java code (e.g. Android layouts and
associated strings or images). These resources are stored according to
[Android's resource directory
structure](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html)
within a Java root folder.

*   content/public/android/java/res - Java resources available within
            content and anything that depends on content
*   chrome/android/java/res - Java resources available within chrome and
            anything that depends on chrome
*   ui/android/java/res - Java resources available within ui and
            anything that depends on ui

Java code can reference these resources in [the normal
way](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/accessing-resources.html)
using a generated R class, being sure to qualify it with the correct package
name.

<pre><code>
// Use a resource from content
setImageResource(<b>org.chromium.content.R</b>.drawable.globe_favicon);
// Use a resource from chrome
setContentView(<b>org.chromium.chrome.R</b>.layout.month_picker);
</code></pre>

### How resources are packaged

While compiling the Java code in content, an R.java file is generated based on
the Java resources in content. This R.java contains non-final constants and is
used only while compiling content (and any non-APK target that depends on
content) but is not included in the content jar.

When building an APK target, such as content_shell_apk, resources are merged
from content, any other dependencies, and from content shell itself. These
merged resources are processed and included in the APK. Based on these
resources, a new R.java is generated with the correct resource -&gt; ID
mappings. This R.java is copied into the R packages needed by each dependency
(e.g. org.chromium.content.R and org.chromium.content_shell.R), and all these
copies are included in the APK.

This process closely follows Android's handling of resources in [library
projects](http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html#LibraryProjects),
where content and chrome are the "libraries", though we don't use the SDK to
compile our "libraries". Hence some of the same
[caveats](http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/index.html#considerations)
apply. In particular, two resources with the same ID cannot coexist. The
resource highest in the dependency chain (e.g. in content shell) will override
the others (e.g. in content).

### Supporting resources in gyp

To add resources to another Java root folder, add the variables
has_java_resources, R_package, and R_package_relpath to the gyp target that
builds that Java code. For example:

<pre><code>
{
  'target_name': 'content_java',
  'type': 'none',
  'dependencies': [ ... ],
  'variables': {
    'package_name': 'content',
    'java_in_dir': '../content/public/android/java',
    <b># Support Java resources in content</b>
    <b>'has_java_resources': 1,</b>
    <b>'R_package': 'org.chromium.content',</b>
    <b>'R_package_relpath': 'org/chromium/content',</b>
  },
  'includes': [ '../build/java.gypi' ],
},
</code></pre>
