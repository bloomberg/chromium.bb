This document describes the process sandboxing mechanism used on Mac OS X.

## Background

Sandboxing treats a process as a hostile environment which at any time can be
compromised by a malicious attacker via buffer overruns or other such attack
vectors. Once compromised, the goal is to allow the process in question access
to as few resources of the user's machine as possible, above and beyond the
standard file-system access control and user/group process controls enforced by
the kernel.

See the [overview document](/developers/design-documents/sandbox) for goals and
general architectural diagrams.

## Implementation

On Mac OS X versions starting from Leopard, individual processes can have their
privileges restricted using the sandbox(7) facility of BSD, also referred to in
some Apple documentation as "Seatbelt". This is made up of a single API call,
sandbox_init(), which sets the access restrictions of a process from that point
on. This means that previously opened file descriptors continue working even if
the new privileges would deny access to newly created descriptors. We can use
this to our advantage by setting up everything correctly at the start of the
process then cutting off all access before we expose the renderer to any 3rd
party input (html, etc).

Seatbelt does not place restrictions on memory allocation, threading, or access
to previously opened OS facilities. As a result, this shouldn't impose any
additional requirements or drastically alter our IPC designs.

OS X provides additional protection against buffer overflows. In Leopard, the
stack is marked as non-executable memory and thus less susceptible as an attack
vector for executing malicious code. This doesn't prevent against buffer
overruns in the heap, but for 64-bit apps, Leopard disallows any attempts to
execute code unless that portion of memory is explicitly marked as executable.
As we move towards 64-bit render processes in the future, this will be another
attractive security feature.

sandbox_init() has supports for both predefined sandbox access restrictions and
sandbox profile scripts which provide finer grained control.

Chromium uses custom sandbox profiles defined in .sb files in the source tree.

The following profiles are defined (paths relative to root of source directory):

*   content/common/common.sb - used for common setup for all sandboxes.
*   content/renderer/renderer.sb - used for the extension & renderer
            processes. Enables access to the font server.
*   chrome/browser/utility.sb - used by the utility process. Allows
            access to a single configurable directory.
*   content/browser/worker.sb - used by the worker process. Most
            restrictive - no file system access apart from loading system
            libraries.
*   chrome/browser/nacl_loader.sb - used for running Native Client
            untrusted (i.e., "user") code.

One sticky point we run into is that the sandboxed process calls through to OS X
system APIs. There is no documentation available about which privileges each API
needs, such as whether they need access to on-disk files, or call other APIs to
which the sandbox restricts access. Our approach to date has been to "warm up"
any problematic API calls before turning the sandbox on. This means that we call
through to the API, to allow it to cache whatever resource it needs. For
example, color profiles and shared libraries can be loaded from disk before we
"lock down" the process.

SandboxInitWrapper::InitializeSandbox() is the main entry point for initializing
the Sandbox, it performs the following steps:

*   Determines if the current process type needs to be sandboxed and if
            so, which sandbox configuration to use.
*   "Warm up" relevant system APIs by calling through to
            sandbox::SandboxWarmup() .
*   Enable the Sandbox by calling through to sandbox::EnableSandbox() .

### Diagnostics

The OS X sandbox implementation supports the following flags:

*   --no-sandbox - Disable the sandbox entirely.
*   --enable-sandbox-logging - Verbose information about which system
            calls are blocked is logged to syslog.

documentation on debugging and diagnostic tools provided by the Mac OS X sandbox
API.
