Overview
The purpose of this API is to allow third parties to develop IMEs for Chrome OS
via extensions.
Use cases
This API would be used to create IMEs that aren’t included in Chrome OS. This
could include Cloud IME solutions, alternate CJK IMEs, or English IMEs and
writing assistants.
There are three basic types of input we should support:

*   Text Generators: Generates a block of text to input into a text
            window. Voice Input is an example of this.
*   Keystroke Generators: Generates distinct keystroke, which are passed
            to the active IME. Virtual Keyboard and Handwriting inputs are
            examples of this.
*   IMEs: Manages the candidate window, composition, and processes key
            events.

An input method extension can behave as any or all of these, but only a single
extension can be active as an IME at a time.
Could this API be part of the web platform?
This is a client side feature, and doesn’t make much sense to add       to HTML5
Do you expect this API to be fairly stable?
Once finalized, I don’t expect this API to change in any way that would break
backwards compatibility.

What UI does this API expose?
On ChromeOS, the user interacts with this API through the IME selection button,
and the candidate window. As such, no new UI would need to be added. To
implement this API on Windows, Mac and Linux, an IME selection method would need
to be added, and the candidate window would need to be exposed.

How could this API be abused?
The biggest danger of this API is that it could easily be used to create key
loggers. Android deals with this issue by adding additional security dialogs to
enable third party IMEs. The danger is mitigated slightly by the fact that
password dialogs do not send their keystrokes to IME. Extensions that generate
keystrokes such as virtual keyboards will still be able to send keystrokes to
password fields and could record this data, however.
This should be protected by both the standard security warning during
installation, and an additional warning/confirmation dialog when enabled for the
first time.
How would you implement your desired features if this API didn’t exist?
There is currently no way for third parties to add IMEs to Chrome OS. Allowing
IMEs executing in any other context than sandboxed Javascript seems much more
dangerous from a security standpoint.
Are you willing and able to develop and maintain this API?
Yes.

Draft API spec
To prevent abuse of IMEs, the API will be guarded by the “ime” permission in
manifest.json.

Manifest Entries:

To use the ime.engine APIs, you need to specify an input_components entry in the
manifest. It will contain an array describing any input components in the
extension.

It should look like:

"input_components" = \[

{

"name": "My IME", // A user visible name.

"type": "ime", // The type of input component.

"id": "my_ime", // The id that will be passed to callbacks

"description": "My Input method for Japanese", // A user visible description

"language": "ja", // The primary language this IME is used for

"layouts": {"jp::jpn", "us:dvorak:eng"} // The supported keyboard layouts for
this IME

}

\]

Types:

*   MenuItem (Object)
    *   id (String)
    *   label (optional String) (default: “”)
    *   style (optional Integer) - Enum representing if this item is:
                None, Check, Radio, or a Separator. Radio buttons between
                separators are considered grouped.
    *   visible (optional Boolean) (default: true)
    *   enabled (optional Boolean) (default: true)
    *   checked (optional Boolean) (default: false)
    *   children (optional Array of MenuItem)
*   KeyboardEvent (Object) - See
            <http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-KeyboardEvent>
    *   type (String) - One of 'keyup' or 'keydown'.
    *   key (String) - Value of the key being pressed
    *   altKey (optional Boolean) - Whether or not the ALT key is
                pressed.
    *   ctrlKey (optional Boolean) - Whether or not the CTRL key is
                pressed.
    *   shiftKey (optional Boolean) - Whether or not the SHIFT key is
                pressed.
*   InputContext (Object)
    *   textID (Integer) - This is used to specify targets of text field
                operations. This ID becomes invalid as soon as onBlur is called.
    *   type (String) - Type of value this text field edits, (Text,
                Number, Password, etc)
