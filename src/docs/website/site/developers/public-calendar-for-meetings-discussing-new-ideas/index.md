title: Public calendar for meetings discussing new ideas
---

We strongly recommend that Chromium discussions happen in public forums!

But, if you would like to discuss an idea that is not yet public with another
Chromium contributor outside of a public forum (eg. in a meeting or a
conference), please add the meeting details to this [public
calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r?cid=Y18xODhlMjI4YWZhMnY4dmswdHJzZ25zcmZwYzJkMDRnYWN0bm11cHJjY2tuNjZycmRAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).

*   Add a brief agenda and any documents/links to track progress.
*   Ensure that the discussion is moved to the public forums and
            reflects any decisions made in such meetings.
*   If you receive interest from another contributor to attend the
            meeting, please try to accommodate the interest.
