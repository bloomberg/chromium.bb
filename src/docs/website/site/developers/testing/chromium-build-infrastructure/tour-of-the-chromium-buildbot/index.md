title: Tour of the Chromium Continuous Integration Console
---

Chromium uses [LUCI](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-go/) to
run continuous builds and tests. The most useful is the [Main
Console](https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/g/main/console). From the top
section you'll see other consoles linked. Each can display its own console view.
The Chromium Console shows the status of many tests. That Console shows a lot of
information that can be hard to understand at first, so let's take a quick tour.

[TOC]

## Basics

The LUCI service watches the git repository, telling machines in Swarming to
start building and testing new revisions, and serves the "console" page that
shows all the results. Every time a new revision is discovered, the scheduler
triggers builders as each serve a different purpose. "Testing" builders are
triggered when a "building" builder doing compilation archives its build. For
example, all "XP Tests (dbg)(N)" and "Vista Tests (dbg)(N)" are triggered when
"Chromium Builder (dbg)" is done archiving its build.

## Builds

Let's take a look at the [console
page](https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/g/main/console). For now, skip over the
header (green, red, yellow, etc.) and the box at the top with lots of links and
horizontal stripes (we'll come back to them later), and look down at the row of
grey boxes with "changes" at the left. Those boxes show one column per builder.

The main console page shows only the builders, machines that build the
executables and then distribute them to numerous machines to run various kinds
of tests.

TODO: Everything below here is outdated.

"Memory" builders run tests using ASAN to check memory correctness, "Perf"
builders are running performance tests, and "GPU" builders run tests related to
GPU usage. "Tree closers" automatically close the tree (preventing people from
committing new changes) when they fail; "FYI" testers are considered less
important, so failures there shouldn't close the tree.

Click on one of the platform names next to a row of colored boxes in the big
grey box at the top, and then on "waterfall" at the left, to see the testing
bots working on that platform, for example
[Windows](http://build.chromium.org/p/chromium.win/waterfall). The set of
builders changes pretty often, so any list we could put here would go out of
date quickly, but the names are generally pretty good at describing what kinds
of machines they are and what kinds of tests they're running. A "dbg" builder is
running a Debug build rather than a Release build. Some machines both build and
test, but "builder" machines only build the executables, then upload them to
"tests" machines to run the tests.

## Build Steps

Now look down one of the columns, starting at the grey box with the builder's
name. Each box shows one step in that builder's build/test sequence, with the
oldest one at the bottom and the current or latest one just below the name box.
Just above the name box is the builder's current activity, and above that is the
final result of the last build/test sequence that finished.

A yellow build step is still in progress, green finished successfully, red
finished with errors, orange finished with warnings, and purple had an internal
build error.

If you click on the "stdio" link for a step, you can see the exact command that
was run and the environment it was run in in blue, and any output it produced in
black. stderr is in red.
Most of the tests are pretty straightforward, but performance test output can be
complicated at times. See the [Guide to Perf Test
Plots](/developers/testing/chromium-build-infrastructure/performance-test-plots)
for more about that.

## Builders vs Testers

A tester doesn't compile, so **you can't clobber it**. It simply extracts its
build from a builder. Testers are triggered when the corresponding builder
finishes.

## Changes

Each time someone commits a change to the repository, the system notifies
builders to start their build and test sequences. (If they're already busy, the
change is queued, which means that more than one change is included in a single
run if they're coming in faster than the builders can test.) The "changes"
column at the left of the waterfall shows who committed a patch and when. If you
hover over that link, you'll see a summary of the change; click on it to see a
little more information. The times at the very left are in Pacific time.
At the start of each run (that is, at the bottom of each series of steps for a
build), there's a yellow box holding the build number. Clicking on that
build-number link shows more information about the run, including in principle
the "blamelist" of changes that went into it. Every now and then, though, that
list of changes is off by one. If you need to know for sure, look at the results
of the "update" step to see exactly what gclient sync pulled in.

## Tree state

The "tree" is the sum of the various source repositories used to build the
project, being Chromium, ChromiumOS, NativeClient, etc. In Chromium case, it's
chrome/src/ plus everything listed in its
[DEPS](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/DEPS?view=markup) file,
and a bit more for Google Chrome like trademarked graphics. The tree can be
"open", "closed" or "throttled". The normal state is open. When tests break, the
tree is closed by putting the word "closed" in the tree status;
[PRESUBMIT.py](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/PRESUBMIT.py?view=markup)
checks the status and will block commits, and the build sheriff will act to fix
the tree. When the tree is throttled, commits are only allowed with specific
permission from the build sheriff, generally because the sheriff wants to make
sure the tree is stable before opening it up to unlimited commits.

## Seeing More and Seeing Less

Tucked away down at the very bottom of the waterfall page is a set of small
links, of which two are particularly useful. The \[next page\] link takes you to
the next screenful of the waterfall, which is backward in time to earlier
builds. The \[help\] link, among other things, shows you a list of all the bots
attached to this waterfall. You can choose which ones you'd like to see, then
bookmark the resulting URL so you can get that view easily next time.

**Banner and Box**

Now back to the top of the waterfall. At the very top is a banner showing the
current state of the tree. If the tree is closed because of build or test
failures, it should be mentioned here. If there's an announcement about a new
build process, expected downtime, or some other aspect of Chromium development,
it'll generally be shown here, too.
Below that is an oval box. It has a number of handy links at the left -- try
them to see where they go. It also has four rows of colored boxes, which show
the pass/fail status of the last completed runs for several categories of
builders. If you click on one of those category names, you'll go to a partial
waterfall view that shows only the related builders. Hovering over a colored box
shows you the name of the builder it's summarizing, and clicking on the box will
go to a waterfall view with only that one builder.

## Sheriffs

The last thing in the oval is a list of this week's build sheriffs. Although
every developer is responsible for running tests before committing patches and
watching the tree for problems afterward, the sheriffs have overall
responsibility in case someone else is away or not paying attention.

## Sources

Most of the source for Chromium's builder setup is found in the
[chromium/tools/build](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/build)
Git repo.

## Adding new build configurations and tests to the main Chromium waterfall & Commit Queue

Since every additional configuration that closes the tree has a cost for all the
developers to maintain it, there are some guidelines for adding new bots to the
main waterfall and commit queue:

*   all the code for this configuration must be in Chromium's public
            repository or brought in through src/DEPS
*   setting up the build should be straightforward for a Chromium
            developer familiar with existing configurations
*   tests should use the existing test harnesses
*   it should be possible for any committer to replicate any testing
            run; i.e. tests and their data must be in the public repository
*   cycle time needs to be under 40 minutes for trybots

In addition to the above requirements, configurations need to catch enough
failures to be worth adding to the commit queue, because running builds on every
CL is expensive. If a configuration only fails once every couple of weeks on the
waterfalls, it's probably not worth it to add it to the commit queue.

If a configuration has tests that depend on code in other repositories, then it
could have its own LUCI project. The team responsible for a separate
configuration would sheriff that separate tree. Teams would generally find it
more maintainable to have a configuration on the main Chromium tree that
observes the above guidelines, even if it only contains a subset of the full
code and tests. Whenever a regression is found that only reproduces on the
separate team's LUCI project, the separate team's goal should be to write a
regression test that runs on the main Chromium waterfall to catch those failures
in Chromium, too.

Please email dpranke@chromium.org to sign off on new build configurations.

When adding new tests for existing build configs, see [Adding new tests to the
Main Waterfall](/developers/testing/adding-tests-to-the-main-waterfall).

## Builder setup

For some builders, there exist no trybots. In order to debug compile failures,
you need to setup a similar compile environment locally:

*   [Linux Builder (dbg-shlib)](/system/errors/NodeNotFound)

## Other views

The [console view](http://build.chromium.org/p/chromium) is the default one.
Marc-Antoine is also looking for people willing to use the [json
interface](http://build.chromium.org/p/chromium/json/help) to create a cool live
interface in Javascript. Contact him for more details.

## Glossary

It's important to use the right words so here are the official definitions:

*   **builder**: a column in the waterfall or console view, doing a
            series of build steps. The build steps involve compiling and/or
            running tests.
*   **bot**: an actual machine (often a VM) connected to a builder. In
            the case of the [try server](/developers/testing/try-server-usage),
            multiple bots are connected to one builder. In general there is a
            1:1 mapping between a bot and a builder so they can usually be used
            interchangeably.
*   **build step**: a shell invocation like *compile* or *update
            sources*. Each builder has a determined series of build steps that
            are executed on the bot.
*   **"a tester"**: a builder that only runs tests, it gets its binaries
            from the extract step.
*   **"a builder"**: a builder has a double-meaning, it can be any
            builder but also only builder that compiles code but does not run
            tests.
*   **"an incremental builder"**: a builder that does incremental
            compiles.
*   **"a full builder"**: a builder that does full compiles, it does a
            clobber on every compile (deleting all build products), starting
            fresh.
*   **clobber**: the act of doing a full builder, versus an incremental
            build. E.g.: rm -rf out; make
