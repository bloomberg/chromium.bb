### Guidelines

1.  Please make sure that you are on the dev channel. We have recently
            refreshed the dev channel, so you will have to sign up for the dev
            channel once again. Instructions for joining the dev channel are
            here: <http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel/>.
2.  Make sure you are running the latest version. You can find
            information about Google Chrome versions here:
            <http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel/release-notes>.
3.  IMPORTANT: Before you begin testing, please [set up a new
            profile](/developers/creating-and-using-profiles). We strongly
            suggest that you use a separate profile folder for testing purposes
            so that the testing does not tamper with your existing profile and
            also to ensure all the volunteers are starting with a similar setup.
    1.  You can clear the profile between tests, as described in the
                [profile page](/developers/creating-and-using-profiles).
    2.  When you are done testing, you can edit the shortcut again to go
                back to your original profile.
4.  Please go through as many test cases as possible. Detailed
            description about the test cases is provided in the column on the
            left. Each test case should be answered with a 'Pass' or 'Fail'
5.  Please try and associate a failing test case with a bug. It could be
            an existing bug or a new issue. Please refer to bug reporting
            guidelines here:
            <http://dev.chromium.org/for-testers/bug-reporting-guidelines>. Use
            the 'Other' response field in the test cases to include the bug
            numbers.
6.  Please do not use this form to send us feature requests or
            information about unrelated crashes or bugs. Please file them
            directly on <http://crbug.com> where they will be looked at along
            with other bugs.
