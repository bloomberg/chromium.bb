title: Network Speed Experiments
---

We're currently experimenting with improving the way clients and servers
communicate. Our primary goal is to reduce page load time for end users. This
page contains information about some of those experiments.

**Notes**

*   The web has evolved almost entirely out of experiments. The
            experiments that worked have stuck. For example, did you know that
            while the web globally in use by 1994, yet HTTP as a protocol was
            not formally standardized until 1996? Chromium network experiments
            are intended to follow a similar pattern. Start with designs that
            make sense, measure prototypes in the lab, measure prototypes in the
            real world, and iterate. Only if the experiment works will we
            continue with that work.
*   Our experiments will always be open source.
*   We will always work with standards bodies where appropriate.
*   All experiments are designed to benefit the web at large, never for
            a single vendor or site.
