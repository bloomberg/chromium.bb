# Jumbo / Unity builds

[Jumbo / Unity builds are no longer supported in Chromium](crbug.com/994387).

They were a mechanism for speeding up local builds by combining multiple
files into a single compilation unit.

We are still in the process of cleaning up the build files to remove
references to the jumbo templates.

**[TODO(crbug.com/994387)](crbug.com/994387)**: Remove this page itself
when all references to jumbo have been removed from the build files.
