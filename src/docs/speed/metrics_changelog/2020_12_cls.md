# Cumulative Layout Shift Changes in Chrome 89

## Changes in Chrome 89

### Ignore layout shift when visibility:hidden becomes visible

We have been always ignoring layout shifts when the element has
visibility:hidden. However before Chrome 89, if the element having
visibility:hidden became visible and shift at the same time, we reported layout
shift. Now we also consider the previous visibility and ignore layout shift in
the case.
