# Perf Bot Health Sheriff

The goal of the perf bot health sheriff rotation is to ensure that the benchmarks running on our perf waterfall continue to produce data and catch regressions quickly. This is also known as "keeping the bots green" and is primarily achieved by triaging incoming alerts. Note that a different rotation [Perf Regressions Sheriffs](../perf_regression_sheriffing.md) is focused on performance.
