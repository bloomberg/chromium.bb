# Updating clang

We distribute prebuilt packages of LLVM binaries, including clang and lld, that
all developers and bots pull at `gclient runhooks` time. These binaries are
just regular LLVM binaries built at a fixed upstream revision. This document
describes how to build a package at a newer revision and update Chromium to it.
An archive of all packages built so far is at https://is.gd/chromeclang

1.  Check that https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/g/chromium.clang/console
    looks reasonably green.
1.  Sync your Chromium tree to the latest revision to pick up any plugin
    changes
1.  Run `python tools/clang/scripts/upload_revision.py NNNN`
    with the target LLVM SVN revision number. This creates a roll CL on a new
    branch, uploads it and starts tryjobs that build the compiler binaries into
    a staging bucket on Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
1.  If the clang upload try bots succeed, copy the binaries from the staging
    bucket to the production one. For example:

    ```shell
    $ export rev=123456-abcd1234-1
    $ for x in Linux_x64 Mac Win ; do \
        gsutil.py cp -n -a public-read gs://chromium-browser-clang-staging/$x/clang-$rev.tgz \
            gs://chromium-browser-clang/$x/clang-$rev.tgz ; \
        gsutil.py cp -n -a public-read gs://chromium-browser-clang-staging/$x/clang-$rev-buildlog.txt \
            gs://chromium-browser-clang/$x/clang-$rev-buildlog.txt ; \
        gsutil.py cp -n -a public-read gs://chromium-browser-clang-staging/$x/llvmobjdump-$rev.tgz \
            gs://chromium-browser-clang/$x/llvmobjdump-$rev.tgz ; \
        gsutil.py cp -n -a public-read gs://chromium-browser-clang-staging/$x/translation_unit-$rev.tgz \
            gs://chromium-browser-clang/$x/translation_unit-$rev.tgz ; \
        gsutil.py cp -n -a public-read gs://chromium-browser-clang-staging/$x/llvm-code-coverage-$rev.tgz \
            gs://chromium-browser-clang/$x/llvm-code-coverage-$rev.tgz ; \
        done
    $ gsutil.py cp -n -a public-read gs://chromium-browser-clang-staging/Mac/lld-$rev.tgz \
          gs://chromium-browser-clang/Mac/lld-$rev.tgz
    ```

1.  Run the goma package update script to push these packages to goma. If you do
    not have the necessary credentials to do the upload, ask clang@chromium.org
    to find someone who does
1.  Run an exhaustive set of try jobs to test the new compiler:

    ```shell
    git cl try &&
    git cl try -B luci.chromium.try -b ios-device -b mac_chromium_asan_rel_ng \
      -b linux_chromium_cfi_rel_ng \
      -b linux_chromium_chromeos_asan_rel_ng -b linux_chromium_msan_rel_ng \
      -b linux_chromium_chromeos_msan_rel_ng -b linux-chromeos-dbg \
      -b win-asan -b chromeos-amd64-generic-cfi-thin-lto-rel
    ```

1.  Optional: Start Pinpoint perf tryjobs. These are generally too noisy to
    catch minor regressions pre-commit, but make sure there are no large
    regressions.

    a.  (Log in to store OAuth2 token in the depot_tools cache. Only needs to be
        run once:)

        $ PYTHONPATH=$(dirname $(which git-cl)) python -c"import auth;auth.OAUTH_CLIENT_ID='62121018386-h08uiaftreu4dr3c4alh3l7mogskvb7i.apps.googleusercontent.com';auth.OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET='vc1fZfV1cZC6mgDSHV-KSPOz';print auth.get_authenticator_for_host('pinpoint',auth.make_auth_config()).login()"

    b.  Generate a fresh Oauth2 token:

        $ TOKEN=$(PYTHONPATH=$(dirname $(which git-cl)) python -c"import auth;print auth.get_authenticator_for_host('pinpoint',auth.make_auth_config()).get_access_token().token")

    c.  Launch Pinpoint job:

        $ curl -H"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -F configuration=chromium-rel-win7-gpu-nvidia \
            -F target=performance_test_suite -F benchmark=speedometer2 \
            -F patch=https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/$(git cl issue | cut -d' ' -f3) \
            -F start_git_hash=HEAD -F end_git_hash=HEAD https://pinpoint-dot-chromeperf.appspot.com/api/new

    d.  Use the URL returned by the command above to see the progress and result
        of the tryjob, checking that it doesn't regress significantly (> 10%).
        Post the URL to the codereview.

1.  Commit roll CL from the first step
1.  The bots will now pull the prebuilt binary, and goma will have a matching
    binary, too.

## Adding files to the clang package

The clang package is downloaded unconditionally by all bots and devs. It's
called "clang" for historical reasons, but nowadays also contains other
mission-critical toolchain pieces besides clang.

We try to limit the contents of the clang package. They should meet these
criteria:

- things that are used by most developers use most of the time (e.g. a
  compiler, a linker, sanitizer runtimes)
- things needed for doing official builds

If you want to add something to the clang package that doesn't (yet?) meet
these criteria, you can make package.py upload it to a separate zip file
and then download it on an opt-in basis by requiring users to run a script
to download the additional zip file. You can structure your script in a way that
it downloads your additional zip automatically if the script detects an
old version on disk, that way users have to run the download script just
once. `tools/clang/scripts/download_lld_mac.py` is an example for this
(It doesn't do the "only download if old version is on disk or if requested"
bit, and hence doesn't run as a default DEPS hook. TODO(thakis): Make
coverage stuff a better example and link to that.)

If you're adding a new feature that you expect will meet the inclusion criteria
eventually but doesn't yet, start by having your things in a separate zip
and move it to the main zip once the criteria are met.
