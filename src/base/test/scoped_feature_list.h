// ScopedFeatureList resets the global FeatureList instance to a new empty
// instance and restores the original instance upon destruction. When using the
// non-deprecated APIs, a corresponding FieldTrialList is also created.
//
// Note: Re-using the same object is not allowed. To reset the feature
// list and initialize it anew, destroy an existing scoped list and init
// a new one.
//
// If multiple instances of this class are used in a nested fashion, they
// should be destroyed in the opposite order of their Init*() methods being
// called.
//
// ScopedFeatureList needs to be initialized on the main thread (via one of
// Init*() methods) before running code that inspects the state of features,
// such as in the constructor of the test harness.
//
// WARNING: To be clear, in multithreaded test environments (such as browser
// tests) there may background threads using FeatureList before the test body is
// even entered. In these cases it is imperative that ScopedFeatureList be
// initialized BEFORE those threads are started, hence the recommendation to do
// initialization in the test harness's constructor.
