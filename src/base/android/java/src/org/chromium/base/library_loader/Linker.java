/*
 * This class provides a way to load the native library as an alternative to System.loadLibrary().
 * It has the ability to save RAM by placing the PT_GNU_RELRO segments in a shared memory region and
 * memory-mapping this region from different processes. This approach saves a few MiB RAM compared
 * to the normal placement of the segment in private dirty memory.
 *
 * In the main library only one PT_GNU_RELRO segment is present, and it maps only one section
 * (.data.rel.ro), so here and below it will be referred as a "RELRO section".
 *
 * When two processes load the same native library at the _same_ memory address, the content of
 * their RELRO section (which includes C++ vtables or any constants that contain pointers) will be
 * largely identical. The exceptions are pointers to external, randomized, symbols, like those from
 * some system libraries, but these are very rare in practice.
 *
 * In order to establish usage of the same shared region in different processes, the Linker can
 * serialize/deserialize the relevant information to/from a Bundle. Providing the RELRO shared
 * memory region is done by loading the library normally, then replacing the virtual address mapping
 * behind the RELRO section with the one backed by the shared memory, with identical contents.
 *
 * Security considerations:
 *
 * - The shared RELRO memory region is always forced read-only after creation, which means it is
 *   impossible for a compromised process to map it read-write (e.g. by calling mmap() or
 *   mprotect()) and modify its content, altering values seen in other processes.
 *
 * - The common library load addresses are randomized for each instance of the program on the
 *   device.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * - The native shared library must be loaded with Linker.loadLibrary(), instead of
 *   System.loadLibrary(). The two functions should behave the same (at a high level).
 *
 * - Before loading the library, setApkFilePath() must be called when loading from the APK.
 *
 * - Early on, before the attempt to load the library, the linker needs to be initialized either as
 *   a producer or a consumer of the RELRO region by invoking ensureInitialized(). Since various
 *   Chromium projects have vastly different initialization paths, for convenience the
 *   initialization runs implicitly as part of loading the library. In this case the behaviour is of
 *   a producer.
 *
 * - When running as a RELRO consumer, the loadLibrary() may block until the RELRO section Bundle
 *   is received. This is done by calling takeSharedRelrosFromBundle() from another thread.
 *
 * - After loading the native library as a RELRO producer, the putSharedRelrosToBundle() becomes
 *   available to then send the Bundle to Linkers in other processes.

     * Initializes the Linker. This is the first method to be called on the instance.
     *
     * Linker and its subclasses abstract away from knowing process types and what the role of each
     * process is. The LibraryLoader and the layers above tell the singleton linker whether it needs
     * to produce the RELRO region, consume it, whether to use the address hint or to synthesize
     * according to a strategy.
     *
     * In many cases finding the library load address is on the critical path, and needs to be
     * transferred to other processes as soon as possible. For this purpose initialization is
     * invoked separately from loading.
     *
     * The caller should provide the |preference| for obtaining the address at which to load the
     * native library. The value is one of these:
     *
     *     FIND_RESERVED, RESERVE_HINT, RESERVE_RANDOM.
     *
     * In the vast majority of cases the chosen preference will be fulfilled and the address (with
     * the size) will be saved for use during {@link Linker#loadLibrary(String)}. In case the
     * preferred way fails (due to address fragmentation, for example), a fallback attempt will be
     * made with |preference| to the right of the current one in the list above. There is no
     * fallback for RESERVE_RANDOM.
     *
     * FIND_RESERVED: Finds the (named) reserved address range for library loading. The caller needs
     *     to make sure that this is only called on platform versions supporting this memory
     *     reservation (Android Q+).
     *
     * RESERVE_HINT: Reserves enough of address range for loading a library, starting at the
     *     |addressHint| provided. The latter is expected to arrive from another process (randomized
     *     there), hence sometimes the address range may not be available.
     *
     * RESERVE_RANDOM: Finds a free random address range and reserves it.
     *
     * With the LegacyLinker this method releases the memory reservation (or does not attempt to do
     * it). This is because the LegacyLinker reserves a region using:
     *
     *     mmap(address_hint, flags_without_MAP_FIXED )
     *
     * This behavior is harmlessly racy: in case something else grabs the address range before the
     * library loading starts, the dynamic linking will load at a different address and fall back to
     * *not* sharing RELRO. The chances of this happening in a fresh process are low.
     *
     * Unmapping and then mapping the region again is likely unnecessary. Ideally both Linkers
     * should start by reserving the memory region early in process lifetime, then load the library
     * with mmap(nullptr, ... MAP_FIXED) on top of it. Unfortunately the crazylinker feature to load
     * on top of a reserved memory region is not well tested and looks buggy.
     *
     * @param asRelroProducer whether the Linker instance will need to produce the shared memory
     *                        region as part of work in {@link Linker#loadLibrary(String)}.
     * @param preference the preference for obtaining the address, with fallback to a less memory
     *                   efficient method
     * @param addressHint the hint to be used when RESERVE_HINT is provided as |preference|
