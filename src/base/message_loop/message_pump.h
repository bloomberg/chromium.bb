  // The Run method is called to enter the message pump's run loop.
  //
  // Within the method, the message pump is responsible for processing native
  // messages as well as for giving cycles to the delegate periodically. The
  // message pump should take care to mix delegate callbacks with native message
  // processing so neither type of event starves the other of cycles. Each call
  // to a delegate function or DoInternalWork() is considered the beginning of a
  // new "unit of work".
  //
  // The anatomy of a typical run loop:
  //
  //   for (;;) {
  //     bool did_internal_work = DoInternalWork();
  //     if (should_quit_)
  //       break;
  //
  //     Delegate::NextWorkInfo next_work_info = delegate->DoWork();

  //
  //     if (did_idle_work)
  //       continue;
  //
  //     WaitForWork();
  //   }
  //

  // Here, DoInternalWork is some private method of the message pump that is
  // responsible for dispatching the next UI message or notifying the next IO
  // completion (for example).  WaitForWork is a private method that simply
  // blocks until there is more work of any type to do.
  //
  // Notice that the run loop cycles between calling DoInternalWork and DoWork
  // methods. This helps ensure that none of these work queues starve the
  // others. This is important for message pumps that are used to drive
  // animations, for example.
  //
  // Notice also that after each callout to foreign code, the run loop checks to
  // see if it should quit.  The Quit method is responsible for setting this
  // flag.  No further work is done once the quit flag is set.
  //
  // NOTE 1: Run may be called reentrantly from any of the callouts to foreign
  // code (internal work, DoWork, DoIdleWork). As a result, DoWork and
  // DoIdleWork must be reentrant.
  //
  // NOTE 2: Run implementations must arrange for DoWork to be invoked as
  // expected if a callout to foreign code enters a message pump outside their
  // control. For example, the MessageBox API on Windows pumps UI messages. If
  // the MessageBox API is called (indirectly) from within Run, it is expected
  // that DoWork will be invoked from within that call in response to
  // ScheduleWork or as requested by the last NextWorkInfo returned by DoWork.
  // The MessagePump::Delegate may then elect to do nested work or not depending
  // on its policy in that context. Regardless of that decision (and return
  // value of the nested DoWork() call), DoWork() will be invoked again when the
  // nested loop unwinds.
