This directory contains the bulk-memory proposal tests, converted to JS using
the reference interpreter using the following shell command:

```
for f in *.wast; do wasm $f -o $f.js; done
```

Where `wasm` is the reference interpreter compiled from the bulk memory
proposal (https://github.com/WebAssembly/bulk-memory-operations).

This only includes the tests that are different than the spec repo. The
testsuite repo (https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite) has a tool which
calculates this, see
https://github.com/WebAssembly/testsuite/tree/master/proposals/bulk-memory-operations
