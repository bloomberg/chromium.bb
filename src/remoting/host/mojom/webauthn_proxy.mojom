// An interface for the host-side chromoting extension to pass intercepted Web
// Authentication API requests to the client side chromoting security extension
// through a chromoting host process.
//
// The interface defined here generally matches the IDL of the Chrome
// webAuthenticationProxy extension API:
//   chrome/common/extensions/api/web_authentication_proxy.idl
//
// The remote of this interface is always owned by a native messaging host
// process; on Windows, the receiver is bound in a chromoting network process,
// while on Linux, the receiver is bound in a chromoting host process. Both the
// remote and the receiver are generally trusted.
//
// There is an intrinsic risk of remote WebAuthn forwarding, but it's an
// accepted risk and the impact is limited given the limited scope of the
// feature. Please see the note here: go/crd-webauthn#heading=h.s445jjbbs1m2
//
// Note that both processes are chromoting-only and they don't make IPCs with
// Chrome processes.

  // |request_data| is the string-serialized representation of the parameters
  // passed to the create() call. It is opaque to chromoting host processes and
  // will be passed verbatim to the client.
  // If |response| is null, it means that the remote create() call has yielded
  // `null`, which is still a valid response according to the spec.
