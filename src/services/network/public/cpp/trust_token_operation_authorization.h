// A Trust Tokens operation requires the 'trust-token-redemption' Feature Policy
// feature if it's of type "redemption" or "signing" (as opposed to "issuance").
//
// Needing the top-level frame's authorization to execute a redemption operation
// has two motivations: security and privacy.
//  - Security: Executing a redemption operation counts against rate limits,
//  currently indelible short of a user-initiated browsing data clear, that are
//  scoped to the redemption-time top frame origin. Using Feature Policy stops
//  subframes from denying service to ancestor frames by exhausting these rate
//  limits.
//  - Privacy: The results of a redemption operation ("signed redemption
//  records") are persistent first-party identifiers in the context of the top
//  frame at redemption time. Since embedded third-party frames are on the other
//  side of a privacy boundary, we’d like to prohibit these third-party frames
//  from having access to the redeeming-context RRs without the top-level
//  frame's explicit consent.
