==== Certificates ====
The certificates in here are extracted from /net/data/ssl/certificates using the
script setup-certificates.sh.
The script produces:
(*) root_ca_cert.pem: An Authority certificate that is the root of the hierarchy.
(*) root-ca-cert.onc: ONC policy for specifying root_ca_cert.pem as an
    additional trust anchor for Web navigations.
(*) ok_cert.pem: A Server certificate that is signed by root_ca_cert.pem.
(*) intermediate_ca_cert.pem: An Authority certificate that is signed by
    root_ca_cert.pem
(*) root-and-intermediate-ca-certs.onc: ONC policy for specifying
    root_ca_cert.pem as an additional trust anchor for Web navigations, and
    intermediate_ca_cert.pem as an untrusted Authority.
(*) ok_cert_by_intermediate.pem: A Server certificate that is signed by
    intermediate_ca_cert.pem.
