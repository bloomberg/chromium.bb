// The original thread model used in upstream chromium is:
//   * browser-main-thread: used to control the browser UI.  This is
//                          responsible for creating browser tabs, windows,
//                          etc.  It is also responsible for creating the
//                          windows in which webkit renders content.  This is
//                          known as the BrowserMain thread.  However, it does
//                          not run webkit/v8.  This is the main application
//                          thread.
//
//   * browser-background-threads: used to control all kinds of things like IO,
//                                 sub-process management, db, caching, gpu
//                                 coordination, etc.
//                                 See browser_thread.h in the content module
//                                 for more details.
//
//   * render-thread: normally this thread runs in a separate process.
//                    However, if "--single-process" is specified on the
//                    command-line, this thread is run as a background thread
//                    in the same process as the browser.  However, the
//                    single-process mode is not officially supported by
//                    chromium and only exists for debugging purposes.  This
//                    thread runs webkit/v8.
//
// The render-thread makes sync calls to the browser threads.  However, browser
// threads must *not* make sync calls to the render-thread.  See
// https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/developers/design-documents/inter-process-communication
//
// Since we want to use webkit/v8 in our application's main thread, we added a
// new thread model called 'RENDERER_MAIN', where the render-thread is on the
// application's main thread.
//
// In this mode, we create a second thread to run browser-main, which spawns
// all the other browser background threads.  When we create a blpwtk2::WebView
// (from the application's main thread, i.e. the render-thread), we post a
// message to the secondary browser-main thread, which sets up the window for
// the web content.  If it is an in-process WebView, then the browser thread
// will post back to the render thread to setup the blink::WebView, otherwise
// it will post to an external renderer process.
//
// Some caveats of this design:
//   * the window that hosts web contents must never be exposed to users of
//     blpwtk2, because it belongs to a different thread (and is created and
//     destroyed asynchronously).  Any window-ey operation we need on the
//     WebView (like show/hide/etc) should be a method on blpwtk2::WebView,
//     which posts to the browser-main thread.  See blpwtk2_webviewproxy where
//     this is done.
//
//   * our WebView<->WebViewDelegate interfaces must be completely asynchronous
//     (i.e. there can be no return values).  Anything that needs to be sent
//     back must be done via callbacks.
//
//   * the WebView::mainFrame() is not available immediately after creating the
//     WebView, because you have to wait for the post to the browser-main
//     thread, and post back to the render thread.  In general, you should wait
//     for the first didFinishLoad() callback on your WebViewDelegate, before
//     attempting to access WebView::mainFrame().

                        // class Toolkit
                        // =============

// This interface can be used to create profiles and WebViews.  A single
// instance of this class can be created using the 'ToolkitFactory'.
//
// Once a tookit is created using the factory, the application must call
// preHandleMessage() and postHandleMessage() for each message within
// the application message loop. Here is an example code:
///<code>
//     MSG msg;
//     while(GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0) > 0) {
//         if (!toolkit->preHandleMessage(&msg)) {
//             TranslateMessage(&msg);
//             DispatchMessage(&msg);
//         }
//         toolkit->postHandleMessage(&msg);
//     }
///</code>
// The behavior is undefined if these functions are not invoked as shown
// in the code snippet above.  If 'preHandleMessage' returns true, this
// means that blpwtk2 has consumed the message, and it should not be
// dispatched through the normal Windows mechanism.  However, the
// application must still call 'postHandleMessage'.
