OVERVIEW
--------

The CEF patch application tool is used to apply patches to the Chromium, Blink
and third-party code bases. Currently only unified diff format is supported.
See the README.txt file in the patch directory for information on how this tool
is used.

The patch.[bat|sh] file can be used to run the patch application tool with
command-line arguments that match the default CEF directory structure and
output options. Run 'patcher.py -h' for a complete list of available command-
line arguments.
