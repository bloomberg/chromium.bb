# OVERVIEW
#
# CMake is a cross-platform open-source build system that can generate project
# files in many different formats. It can be downloaded from
# http://www.cmake.org or installed via a platform package manager.
#
# CMake-generated project formats that have been tested with this CEF binary
# distribution include:
#
# Linux:      Ninja, Unix Makefiles
# MacOS:      Ninja, Xcode 8+ (x86_64) or Xcode 12.2+ (ARM64)
# Windows:    Ninja, Visual Studio 2015+
#
# Ninja is a cross-platform open-source tool for running fast builds using
# pre-installed platform toolchains (GNU, clang, Xcode or MSVC). It can be
# downloaded from http://martine.github.io/ninja/ or installed via a platform
# package manager.
#
# CMAKE STRUCTURE
#
# This CEF binary distribution includes the following CMake files:
#
# CMakeLists.txt              Bootstrap that sets up the CMake environment.
# cmake/*.cmake               CEF configuration files shared by all targets.
# libcef_dll/CMakeLists.txt   Defines the libcef_dll_wrapper target.
# tests/*/CMakeLists.txt      Defines the test application target.
#
# See the "TODO:" comments below for guidance on how to integrate this CEF
# binary distribution into a new or existing CMake project.
#
# BUILD REQUIREMENTS
#
# The below requirements must be met to build this CEF binary distribution.
#
# - CMake version 2.8.12.1 or newer.
#
# - Linux requirements:
#   Currently supported distributions include Debian Wheezy, Ubuntu Precise, and
#   related. Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit is recommended. Newer versions will likely also
#   work but may not have been tested.
#   Required packages include:
#     build-essential
#     libgtk3.0-dev     (required by the cefclient target only)
#
# - MacOS requirements:
#   Xcode 8 or newer building on MacOS 10.11 (El Capitan) or newer for x86_64.
#   Xcode 12.2 or newer building on MacOS 10.15.4 (Catalina) or newer for ARM64.
#   Only 64-bit builds are supported. The Xcode command-line tools must also be
#   installed.
#
# - Windows requirements:
#   Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 or newer building on Windows 7 or newer. Visual
#   Studio 2019 and Windows 10 64-bit are recommended.
#
# BUILD EXAMPLES
#
# The below commands will generate project files and create a Debug build of all
# CEF targets using CMake and the platform toolchain.
#
# Start by creating and entering the CMake build output directory:
# > cd path/to/cef_binary_*
# > mkdir build && cd build

# CEF_ROOT setup.
# This variable must be set to locate the binary distribution.
# TODO: Choose one of the below examples and comment out the rest.
#

# Example 1: The current directory contains both the complete binary

# Example 2: The binary distribution is in a separate directory from your
#            project. Locate the binary distribution using the CEF_ROOT CMake
#            variable.
# A. Create a directory structure for your project like the following:
#    myproject/
#      CMakeLists.txt    <= top-level CMake configuration
#      mytarget/
#        CMakeLists.txt  <= CMake configuration for `mytarget`
#        ... other `mytarget` source files
# B. Copy this file to "myproject/CMakeLists.txt" as the top-level CMake
#    configuration.
# C. Create the target-specific "myproject/mytarget/CMakeLists.txt" file for
#    your application. See the included cefclient and cefsimple CMakeLists.txt
#    files as an example.
# D. Comment in these lines:
#
# set(CEF_ROOT "c:/path/to/cef_binary_3.2704.xxxx.gyyyyyyy_windows32")
# set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} "${CEF_ROOT}/cmake")

# Example 3: The binary distribution is in a separate directory from your
#            project. Locate the binary distribution using the CEF_ROOT
#            environment variable.
# A. Create a directory structure for your project like the following:
#    myproject/
#      CMakeLists.txt    <= top-level CMake configuration
#      cmake/
#        FindCEF.cmake   <= CEF CMake configuration entry point
#      mytarget/
#        CMakeLists.txt  <= CMake configuration for `mytarget`
#        ... other `mytarget` source files
# B. Copy this file to "myproject/CMakeLists.txt" as the top-level CMake
#    configuration.
# C. Copy the cmake/FindCEF.cmake file to "myproject/cmake/FindCEF.cmake".
# D. Create the target-specific "myproject/mytarget/CMakeLists.txt" file for
#    your application. See the included cefclient and cefsimple CMakeLists.txt
#    files as an example.
# E. Set the CEF_ROOT environment variable before executing CMake. For example:
#    > set CEF_ROOT=c:\path\to\cef_binary_3.2704.xxxx.gyyyyyyy_windows32
# F. Comment in these lines:
#
# set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake")
