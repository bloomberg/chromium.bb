/// from the C API to this structure. Additionally,
/// reads and writes to this data structure are guaranteed
/// to be able to propagate through Mojo as they are
/// volatile. Language optimization backends are generally
/// unaware of other address spaces, and since this structure
/// represents some buffer from another address space, we
/// need to make sure loads and stores are volatile.
///
/// Changes to this data structure are propagated through Mojo
/// on the next Mojo operation (that is, Mojo operations are
/// considered barriers). So, unmapping the buffer, sending a
/// message across a pipe, duplicating a shared buffer handle,
/// etc. are all valid ways of propagating changes. The read
/// and write methods do NOT guarantee changes to propagate.
