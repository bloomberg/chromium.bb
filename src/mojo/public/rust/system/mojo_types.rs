//! This module contains a variety of types which are used
//! for representing representing flag arguments a little bit
//! better than just as u32 and some other basic Mojo types that
//! we need to expose.
//!
//! This module also provides MojoResult which is the canonical
//! result coding system used by Mojo.
//!
//! Many places in the system code directly import this module as
//! a whole because it is intended to be used that way. It contains
//! all of the basic types needed by all system-level Mojo bindings.
