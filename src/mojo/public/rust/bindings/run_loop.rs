//! This module contains a thread-local run-loop.
//!
//! The run-loop may have handles and handlers pre-registers
//! (and in fact, must) in order to keep running. The run-loop
//! executes until it has no more handles or handlers on itself,
//! or until it is told to quit via stop().
//!
//! The run-loop waits until some signals on some handle is satisfied,
//! at which point it wakes up and executes the appropriate handler
//! method. This handler method may then be used to further populate
//! or de-populate the run-loop.
//!
//! As of yet, the run-loop is NOT thread-safe. Although it is useful
//! to be able to register tasks or handles from one thread onto
//! another thread's run-loop, this is as-of-yet unsupported, and
//! Rust should complain loudly when you try to do any threading here.
