// These test suites work more or less. They still rely on some old Mojo
// behavior such as wait sets (see https://codereview.chromium.org/2744943002).
// These are temporarily replaced in support.cc.

// Has one broken test that panics during a panic. It's disabled for now.
mod regression;

// These tests have two problems:
// * lots of test data from the Mojo SDK doesn't exist / has changed
// * the mojom encoding has changed since this code was written
//
// The code in crate/bindings/{encoding,decoding}.rs needs to be updated and
// the tests must be updated to use the available test data
