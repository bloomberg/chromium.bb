// Generic helper used to own a collection of Receiver endpoints. For

//
// Note that this type is not typically used directly by application. Instead,
// prefer to use one of the various aliases (like ReceiverSet) that are based on
// it.
//
// If |ContextType| is non-void, then every added receiver must include a
// context value of that type (when calling |Add()|), and |current_context()|
// will return that value during the extent of any message dispatch or
// disconnection notification pertaining to that specific receiver.
//
// So for example if ContextType is |int| and we call:
//
//   Remote<mojom::Foo> foo1, foo2;
//   ReceiverSet<mojom::Foo> receivers;
//   // Assume |this| is an implementation of mojom::Foo...
//   receivers.Add(this, foo1.BindNewReceiver(), 42);
//   receivers.Add(this, foo2.BindNewReceiver(), 43);
//
//   foo1->DoSomething();
//   foo2->DoSomething();
//
// We can expect two asynchronous calls to |this->DoSomething()|. If that
// method looks at the value of |current_context()|, it will see a value of 42
// while executing the call from |foo1| and a value of 43 while executing the
// call from |foo2|.
//
// Finally, note that ContextType can be any type of thing, including move-only
// objects like std::unique_ptrs.
