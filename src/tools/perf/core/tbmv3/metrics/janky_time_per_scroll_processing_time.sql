--
-- A collection of metrics related to GestureScroll events.
--
-- We compute a couple different metrics.
--
-- 1) GestureScrollMilliseconds
--      The time spent scrolling during the trace. Measured as the timestamp of
--      the GestureScrollBegin to the end timestamp of the last event (either
--      GestureScrollEnd or a GestureScrollUpdate that extends past the
--      GestureScrollEnd).
-- 2) GestureScrollProcessingMilliseconds
--      The time spent in milliseconds working on GestureScrollUpdates. This
--      differs from "GestureScrollMilliseconds" by including overlapping
--      events. For example if a scroll is made of two events from microsecond 1
--      to microsecond 4 like this:
--        0  1  2  3
--        |-----|
--           |-----|
--      Then GestureScrollMilliseconds will by 3 (scroll started at 0 and ended
--      at 3), and Processing time will be 4 (both events are duration 2 so the
--      sum is 4).
-- 3) Jank.NumJankyGestureScrollUpdates
--      The number of GestureScrollUpdate events we believe can be classified as
--      "janky". Definition of janky is given below.
-- 4) Jank.JankyGestureScrollMilliseconds
--      The sum of the duration of all the events classified as "janky". I.E.
--      for every event included in the count of
--      |Jank.NumJankyGestureScrollUpdates| sum their duration.
-- 5) Jank.JankyTimePerScrollProcessingTimePercentage
--      This is |Jank.JankyGestureScrollMilliseconds| divided by
--      |GestureScrollProcessingMilliseconds| and then multiplied into a
--      percentage. Due to limitations this is rounded down to the nearest whole
--      percentage.
--
-- We define a GestureScrollUpdate to be janky if comparing forwards or
-- backwards (ignoring coalesced updates) a given GestureScrollUpdate exceeds
-- the duration of its predecessor or successor by 50% of a vsync interval
-- (currently pegged to 60 FPS).
--
-- WARNING: This metric should not be used as a source of truth. It is under
--          active development and the values & meaning might change without
--          notice.


-- Get all the GestureScrollBegin and GestureScrollEnd events. We take their
-- IDs to group them together into scrolls later and the timestamp and duration
-- to compute the duration of the scroll.

-- Get all processes which are related to Chrome to the best of our current
-- ability.
