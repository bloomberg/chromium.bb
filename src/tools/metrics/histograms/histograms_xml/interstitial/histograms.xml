    User decision when presented with a security interstitial. As of M44,

    social_engineering_ads* and social_engineering_landing* interstitial reasons
    are split into their own entries from phishing*.

<histogram name="interstitial.decision.repeat_visit"

  <owner>felt@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>carlosil@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    User decision when presented with a security interstitial, on a site that
    the user had previously visited. As of M44, subresource interstitials were
    split into their own entries. As of M52, social_engineering_ads* and

  <summary>
    User interactions with a security interstitial. As of M44, subresource

<histogram name="interstitial.ssl.captive_portal" enum="SSLCaptivePortal"
    expires_after="M85">
  <owner>meacer@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Record possible states of captive portals. This histogram is emitted
    (possibly multiple times to different buckets) whenever a ssl interstitial
    page is displayed and captive portal detection is enabled. The captive
    portal technique forces a client on a network to see a special web page
    (usually for authentication purposes) before using the internet normally.

<histogram name="interstitial.ssl.cause.nonoverridable" enum="SSLErrorCauses"
    expires_after="M90">
  <owner>estark@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>carlosil@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Possible non-attack causes of the non-overridable SSL interstitial. Many
    errors are not reported in this histogram and new errors may be added over
    time, therefore one should not look at the breakdown of this histogram (one
    bucket divided by the sum) because that will be inaccurate. Instead, one
    should look at each bucket count divided by the count of the ssl errors of
    that type. E.g. WWW mismatch is recorded only when the ssl error is
    CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID, so one should look at the bucket count of WWW
    mismatch divided by the bucket count of CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID in the
    histogram interstitial.ssl_error_type.
  </summary>

    State of the system clock, as inferred from the build timestamp, when an SSL

    The histogram shows the connection types associated with SSL warnings. E.g.,
    do more warnings occur on WiFi?

<histogram name="interstitial.ssl.did_user_revoke_decisions2"
    enum="BooleanRevoked" expires_after="M89">
  <owner>carlosil@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Specifies when a user enters the page info menu whether or not the user
    pressed the SSL decisions revoke button. This is logged when the page info
    UI is closed, only if the button was visible in the page info.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="interstitial.ssl.visited_site_after_warning" enum="Boolean"
    expires_after="M77">

    warning.

<histogram name="interstitial.ssl_error_handler.cert_date_error_delay"
    units="ms" expires_after="M77">
  <owner>estark@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    When handling a certificate date error, Chrome (under certain Variations
    Service experiments) will delay displaying the warning interstitial for up
    to 3 seconds while querying a network time service. This histogram records
    the amount of time for which the interstitial was delayed on this check. The
    histogram is recorded even when a time query is not sent (for example,
    because Chrome already had an up-to-date network timestamp that it could
    use, or because the client is not in the experimental group that enables
    network time queries).

<histogram name="interstitial.ssl_error_type" enum="SSLErrorTypes"
    expires_after="M89">
  <owner>estark@chromium.org</owner>

  <summary>
    The type of SSL error that the user encounters. This is recorded for all SSL
    warnings, regardless of whether they are overridable.

<histogram name="interstitial.ssl_nonoverridable.is_recurrent_error"
    enum="BooleanRecurrentError" expires_after="M72">
