This file is used to generate a comprehensive list of PCScan histograms
along with a detailed description for each histogram.

For best practices on writing histogram descriptions, see

Please send CLs to chromium-metrics-reviews@google.com rather than to specific
individuals. These CLs will be automatically reassigned to a reviewer within
about 5 minutes. This approach helps the metrics team to load-balance incoming
reviews. Googlers can read more about this at go/gwsq-gerrit.
