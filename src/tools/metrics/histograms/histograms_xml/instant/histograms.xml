  <owner>better-together-dev@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Provides a breakdown of how many times each possible Bluetooth advertisement
    registration result occurs.

    The bucket &quot;Unknown result&quot; indicates that the Bluetooth platform
    returned an unknown error code; if it has any counts, the client code should
    be changed to account for the new error code.

    expires_after="2021-02-02">
  <owner>hansberry@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>better-together-dev@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Provides a top-level breakdown of the times a connection to a host has
    failed.

    An &quot;unknown error&quot; is caused by the host returning an
    &quot;unknown error&quot; response code. Tethering timing out and client
    connection error are both broken down further in
    InstantTethering.ConnectionToHostResult.Failure.TetheringTimeout and
    InstantTethering.ConnectionToHostResult.Failure.ClientConnection,
    respectively.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram
    name="InstantTethering.ConnectionToHostResult.Failure.ClientConnection"

    expires_after="2021-02-02">
  <owner>hansberry@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>better-together-dev@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Breaks down the reasons why the client failed to connect to the hotspot, and
    the number of times they occurred.

    Note that a client connection can be canceled by a user either via pressing
    the Disconnect button or beginning a connection attempt to another host. The
    &quot;internal error&quot; case is a general bucket that captures client
    errors we don't expect to be significant failure causes.

    This histogram breaks down the &quot;client connection error&quot; count of
    InstantTethering.ConnectionToHostResult.Failure.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram
    name="InstantTethering.ConnectionToHostResult.Failure.TetheringTimeout"
    enum="InstantTethering_ConnectionToHostResult_Failure_TetheringTimeout"
    expires_after="2021-02-02">
  <owner>hansberry@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>better-together-dev@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Captures the number of times of whether or not first-time setup was required
    when tethering timed out.

    Starting tethering on the host works like so: if first-time setup is
    required on the host, a first-time setup UI is shown on the host; once the
    user interacts with it, the provisioning app is called. If first-time setup
    is not required, then the provisioning app is directly called. To be clear:
    the provisioning app is always run.

    There are two possible ways for tethering to time out: either the
    provisioning app flaked (crashed or hung, and never called back to Instant
    Tethering), or the user never interacted with the first-time setup UI flow
    (assuming first-time setup was required).

    Because it's very unlikely for the provisioning app to flake, we can read
    the &quot;was first-time setup&quot; count as almost always indicative of
    the user not interacting with the first-time setup UI. We expect the
    &quot;was not first-time setup&quot; count to be low (because, as mentioned,
    it's very unlikely for the provisioning app to flake).

    This histogram breaks down the &quot;tethering timed out&quot; count of
    InstantTethering.ConnectionToHostResult.Failure.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram
    name="InstantTethering.ConnectionToHostResult.ProvisioningFailureRate"
    enum="InstantTethering_ConnectionToHostResult_ProvisioningFailureRate"
    expires_after="2021-02-02">
  <owner>hansberry@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>better-together-dev@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Provides a breakdown of the times a connection to a host was either
    unsuccessful due to provisioning failure (the carrier disallows tethering)
    or &quot;other&quot; (this is captured under
    InstantTethering.ConnectionToHostResult.SuccessRate.Background).

    This metric captures the rough percentage of connections which are
    unsuccessful due to provisioning failure. It is separate from
    InstantTethering.ConnectionToHostResult.SuccessRate.Background and the
    metrics related to it because provisioning failure is neither truly a
    success nor an error.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram
    name="InstantTethering.ConnectionToHostResult.SuccessRate.Background"
    enum="InstantTethering_ConnectionToHostResult_SuccessRate"
    expires_after="2021-04-04">
  <owner>hansberry@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>better-together-dev@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Captures the count of successful and failed connection attempts.

    This metric counts the top-level user action from beginning to connect, all
    the way through success or failure of the connection (excluding any
    programmatic retries within the connection attempt).

    This metric provides an immediate understanding of the Instant Tethering
    connection success rate. The counts of failure are broken down in
    InstantTethering.ConnectionToHostResult.Failure.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="InstantTethering.FeatureState"
    enum="InstantTethering_FeatureState" expires_after="2021-04-04">
  <owner>hansberry@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>better-together-dev@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Breaks down the state of Instant Tethering during user sessions. All states,
    except for 'Enabled', indicate that the feature was not active. This
    histogram is emitted to each time a condition affecting Instant Tethering's
    state, e.g. the user enabling or disabling the feature, or Bluetooth
    becoming enabled or disabled.

    Note: The &quot;Screen locked&quot; bucket is obsolete, and should not have
    any reports.
  </summary>

<histogram name="InstantTethering.HostScanBatchDuration" units="ms"
    expires_after="2021-02-02">
  <owner>hansberry@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>better-together-dev@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    The duration of a batch of host scans. A batch is defined as a series of one
    or host scans separated by no more than one minute.

    For example, if a scan occurs then stops and does not start back up again,
    the metric logged would be the amount of time taken for that scan. However,
    if a scan finishes and a new scan starts up again less than a minute after
    the previous scan finished, the metric logged would be the time difference
    between the start of the first scan and the finish of the second scan.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="InstantTethering.HostScanResult"
    enum="InstantTethering_HostScanResult" expires_after="2021-05-09">
  <owner>hansberry@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>better-together-dev@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Provides a breakdown of the results of each host scan. This metric is
    recorded after each host scan.

    Comparing the number of times no hosts were found against the other buckets
    can help determine how often a host scan is useful.

    The sum of the buckets capturing that a notification was shown can be used
    as a baseline of comparison against
    InstantTethering.ConnectionToHostResult.ProvisioningFailureRate to roughly
    measure engagement with the notification.
  </summary>

  <owner>hansberry@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>better-together-dev@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    The duration of time between the start and end of a Tether connection.
    Timing starts when the device connects to the Wi-Fi hotspot and ends when
    the device becomes disconnected from the Wi-Fi hotspot.

    enum="MultiDevice_FeatureState" expires_after="2021-04-04">
  <owner>hansberry@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>better-together-dev@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Indicates the feature state of the Instant Tethering feature. This metric is
    emitted to at the creation of the user session (when the user logs in), and
    when feature state updates occur.
