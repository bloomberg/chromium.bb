# Core Metrics Owners
#
# Note: Please send CLs to chromium-metrics-reviews@google.com rather than to
# specific individuals from the list of core metrics owners. These CLs will be
# automatically reassigned to a reviewer within about 5 minutes. This approach
# helps our team to load-balance incoming reviews. Googlers can read more about
# this at go/gwsq-gerrit.
file://base/metrics/OWNERS

# Prefer chromium-metrics-reviews@google.com instead.
# Use the following owners only if:
#  - You work in the same area as them.
#  - They are already a good reviewer for the non-metrics part of the CL.
cthomp@chromium.org  # For security-related metrics only.

chrome-metrics-team+robot@google.com # For bot updates to expiry.

# All metrics changes should be reviewed by metrics reviewers.
