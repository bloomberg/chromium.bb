  <summary>
    The time interval between when a WebView-using app's copy of the variations
    seed was written to its local app storage and when it was loaded for use.
    This is different from Variations.SeedFreshness because it measures
    freshness from when the app received its copy of the seed, not when the seed
    was originally downloaded. Written every time the browser process
    initializes, but not if there was an error reading the seed, or no seed
    existed.
