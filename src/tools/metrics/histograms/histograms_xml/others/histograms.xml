    The percent dropped frame is calculated for each sliding window of 1 second
    length and added to a histogram, and then the 95 percentile of that
    histogram is reported as 95pctPercentDroppedFrames_1sWindow.

    The sliding windows cover the duration of page-load (From start of page-load
    until user navigates away, or closes the tab/chrome, or when app goes to
    background). Note that this means that this metric will bias toward tabs
    that are closed more quickly, and might underreport tabs that remain open
    for a long duration.

    PercentDroppedFrames is measured by tracking the number of frames which were
    not displayed on screen out of the total number of frames expected to be
    produced and displayed. In other words, the lower this number is, the

    Tracks the percent of frames that were shown with checkerboards during a
    particular sequence of frames (e.g. during scroll, animation, etc.). Note
    that this is only recorded for sequences of length &gt; 4.

    Checkerboarding is measured by tracking the number of times checkerboard
    frames are displayed (as opposed to the number of checkerboard frames
    produced), since the same checkerboard frame can be displayed more than
    once.

    Diagnostic metric to measure how many dependent reporters have been

    The reporters might be dependant on another reporter (when having partial

    them earlier. This metric count how many of such reporters been discarded
    earlier than expected as a result of outstanding number of dependent

    Page load time for Browser-initiated navigations.

    Browser-initiated navigations include all navigations initiated by
    interacting with Chrome's UI elements, except for back/forward navigations.
    Specifically, typing a URL into the omnibox, tapping the reload button,
    loading a bookmark, and loading a page from the reading list (including when
    offline) are all considered browser-initiated. Additionally, background
    loads for prerendering and reading-list offline sync are also
    browser-initiated, as is a reload triggered by switching to a tab whose
    WKWebView renderer process was killed by the OS.

    This is recorded for successful main-frame navigations (that is, navigations
    that don't result in the browser displaying an error page). The recorded
    value measures the time from the navigation request being sent to the
    renderer process until all frames have fired their load events. For
    background loads, the same interval is measured while the page loads and
    fires load events in the background; the metric is not recorded again if the
    background-loaed page is later displayed in the foreground.

    It is possible for a user to interact with a page before all load events
    have been fired, so the recorded value should not be interpreted as the time
    before the page becomes interactive.

    Any navigation that is not considered browser-initiated is considered to be
    renderer-initiated (see PLT.iOS.RendererInitiatedPageLoadTime).

    Page load time for Renderer-initiated navigations.

    Renderer-initiated navigations are all main-frame navigations that are not
    considered to be browser-initiated (see
    PLT.iOS.BrowserInitiatedPageLoadTime). Specificially, tapping on links
    within web content, navigations triggered by JavaScript, navigations for
    restoring tabs on launch, and back/forward navigations are all considered to
    be renderer-initiated.

    This is recorded for successful main-frame navigations (that is, navigations
    that don't result in the browser displaying an error page). However, this is
    not recorded when WebKit handles a navigation using its page cache (that is,
    when the DOM representation of the destination is still loaded in memory
    from a recent visit). The recorded value measures the time from the browser
    process being notified that the navigation has started, to all frames having
    fired their load events. The time that the browser process is notified that
    the navigation has started is usually just after a network request is sent,
    but can be later for back/forward navigations on sites that use pushState to
    generate history entries; in the latter case, the navigation may be almost
    finished by the time the browser finds out about it.

    It is possible for a user to interact with a page before all load events
    have been fired, so the recorded value should not be interpreted as the time
    before the page becomes interactive.
