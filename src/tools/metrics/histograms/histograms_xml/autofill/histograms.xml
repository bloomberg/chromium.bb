    submission, for form with autocomplete=&quot;one-time-code&quot;. An
    interaction requires changing a form control's value manually or via
    autofill. The interaction can happen on a different form than the one which
    is submitted. This is recorded once per form submission.

    Records whether a frame collects phone number based on the field

    Note that the field types may not be calculated if there are less than 3

    form has only a single field regarding phone number without specifiying
    autocomplete=&quot;phone&quot;, a sample with &quot;false&quot; will be
    reported.
