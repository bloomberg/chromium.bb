    Tracks the number of times Chrome made a GetDetailsForGetRealPan call. A

    As a percentage of the number of times card suggestions are shown, which is
    tracked under Autofill.FormEvents.CreditCard, this metric provides an
    estimate for the potential reach for the Autofill Better Auth project.
    Moreover, this acts as a baseline value for other metrics in this project.

    This is useful when compared to Autofill.BetterAuth.OptInPromoUserDecision,

    Tracks the user response to the opt-in promo for using FIDO authentication
    for card unmasking. The user can either accept the promo and proceed to
    perform user-verification, can decline the promo immediately, or first
    accept the promo but then decline while the challenge is being fetched. Only

    The GetDetailsForGetRealPan call is made when card suggestions are shown.
    This metric tracks whether the response is received before or after a card

    The GetDetailsForGetRealPan call is made when card suggestions are shown.
    This metric logs the duration of the perceived latency when the response for

    The GetDetailsForGetRealPan call is made when card suggestions are shown. If

    Counts whether users interacted with a form of a certain type.

    Focusing a field is sufficient to consider a form as being interacted with.

    focused on page load.

    This metric is recorded once per form observed by Autofill, but only for
    forms that Autofill classifies to be of the type indicated by the histogram
    name. If a form changes dynamically, Autofill interprets the forms before
    and after the change as two different forms and records two values. If a
    form did not have features that classify it as a form of a certain type
    (e.g. an address form or payment form), then nothing is recorded.

    Records whether a frame collects phone number based on the field
    classification. It records once per frame only if it has parsed forms.

    Note that the field types may not be calculated if there are less than 3
    fields in the form unless an autocomplete attribute is provided. e.g. if the
    form has only a single field regarding phone number without specifiying
    autocomplete=&quot;phone&quot;, a sample with &quot;false&quot; will be
    reported.
