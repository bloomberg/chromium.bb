    Records the number of PermissionStatus handles that have been created by a

  <owner>dominickn@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>kcarattini@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    For every permission request that would show a prompt to the user, this
    metric tracks whether the request is suppressed by embargo (and the source
    of that embargo), or whether there is no embargo and the prompt is shown.
    This is the proportion of permission prompts that the user would have seen
    that have been blocked due to embargo.

    If the (origin, permission) pair was previously placed under embargo, no
    prompt is displayed and the reason for embargo is recorded. Otherwise, the
    prompt is shown and a no embargo reason is recorded.

  <summary>
    Tracks the reason that an (origin, permission) pair has been placed under
    embargo (blocked from making requests for that permission for a period of
    time). This is triggered when a permission is placed under embargo for
    blacklisting (once Safe Browsing has returned a result), when a permission
    prompt has been shown and it is placed under embargo for repeated
    dismissals, or when a permission prompt is shown and not embargoed.
