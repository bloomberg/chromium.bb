    This metric measures the total time spent on completing encoding all the

    Encoding occurs during one or more idle periods on the main thread and the
    waiting time of the next idle period is included in the measurement. If the
    code has swtiched to force encoding path, we will not measure the delay in
    this metric.

    This metric is useful in helping us adjust the IdleTaskCompleteTimeoutDelay
    in canvas.toBlob. When the encoding idle task is delayed for longer than
    IdleTaskCompleteTimeoutDelay, the browser will switch to a non-idle task to
    force encoding to happen on the main thread.

    In addition, metric values from OffscreenCanvas.convertToBlob API call are

  <summary>
    Records usage of CSS properties used on a page, either statically or

  <details>
    The first time a CSS property is parsed on a page, the histogram is updated
    to increment the counter. Each histogram bucket corresponds to a CSS
    property (eg. width, border-radius). The exception is the 'Total pages
    measured' bucket - this counts the number of pages that CSS properties were
    counted on. When a page navigation occurs the page count bucket is
    incremented and tracking of the set of which properties have been seen is
    reset.

    These numbers give the percentage of pages that use a CSS property. For
    example, if the 'border-radius' histogram bucket has a count of 250, and the
    page count bucket (i.e. bucket number 1) has a count of 1000 - this means
    that 1000 pages were recorded, and border-radius was used on 25% of those
    pages.

    Note that CSS properties used inside of SVG images are tracked separately in
    the Blink.UseCounter.SVGImage.CSSProperties histogram.

    As of M57 this histogram supercedes WebCore.FeatureObserver.CSSProperties.

    As of M69, Blink.UseCounter.AnimatedCSSProperties is moved from the blink
    side to the browser side.
