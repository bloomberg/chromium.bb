    When a navigation is committed, it should have a non-null NavigationContext.
    This histogram counts the frequency of this invariant holding at the time
    when a new navigation is committed. It is used to verify the effectiveness
    of code fixes because this issue is not currently reproducible in testing
    (http://crbug.com/864769). True means a non-null NavigationContext is

  <owner>justincohen@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Recorded when app is running in the background and posted a background task.
    This time is obtained by calling UIApplication.backgroundTimeRemaining. When
    backgroundTimeRemaining reaches 0 and there is at least one running
    background task, then iOS terminates the app instead of suspending it. The
    lower recorded value is, the higher chances that posted task will keep
    running when backgroundTimeRemaining reaches 0, causing the app termination.
    When app is relaunched after termination the app starts cold which is slower
    and does not fully restore the prior UI state, so terminations are worse
    than suspensions.
