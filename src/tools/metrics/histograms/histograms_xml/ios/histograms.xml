    When a navigation is committed, it should have a non-null NavigationContext.
    This histogram counts the frequency of this invariant holding at the time
    when a new navigation is committed. It is used to verify the effectiveness
    of code fixes because this issue is not currently reproducible in testing
    (http://crbug.com/864769). True means a non-null NavigationContext is

    Recorded when app is running in the background and posted a background task.
    This time is obtained by calling UIApplication.backgroundTimeRemaining. When
    backgroundTimeRemaining reaches 0 and there is at least one running
    background task, then iOS terminates the app instead of suspending it. The
    lower recorded value is, the higher chances that posted task will keep
    running when backgroundTimeRemaining reaches 0, causing the app termination.
    When app is relaunched after termination the app starts cold which is slower
    and does not fully restore the prior UI state, so terminations are worse
    than suspensions.

    [iOS] The number of items Navigation Manager was requested to restore. 100

    just a requested count and actual number of restored items can be smaller.

    [iOS] Time spent on restoring committed Navigation Manager's items. Recorded

    triggered in the following cases (the list is not exhaustive): app cold
    start, remote tab was open, cookies were cleared, recently closed tab was

    The URL in a navigation request should have the same host as the URL in the
    corresponding response, but this sometimes doesn't hold after a server
    redirect because of a WKWebView bug. This histogram counts the frequency of
    this invariant violation, and is logged each time that a main-frame
    navigation response is received after a server redirect. True means that the
    request and response URLs have the same host.

  <summary>
    Counts the number of Chrome Siri Shortcuts that the user has created in the
    Siri Shortcuts app. This is recorded once during startup. The histogram caps
    at 20 shortcuts, which is an arbitrary but reasonable limit. Note that
    shortcuts that have multiple actions are not counted if at least one action
    isn't a Chrome-provided one. For example, a shortcut that opens URLs in
    Chrome and then opens URLs in another app won't be counted. As such, this
    metric undercounts the true number of Chrome shortcuts. This is a
    restriction of the native Shortcuts API.
