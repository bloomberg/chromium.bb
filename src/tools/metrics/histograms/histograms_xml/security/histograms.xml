<histogram
    name="Security.CertificateTransparency.MainFrameNavigationCompliance"
    enum="CTComplianceStatus" expires_after="M78">
  <owner>estark@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The compliance of each main frame navigation's connection with the
    Certificate Transparency policy. Recorded whenever a main-frame,
    non-same-page navigation is committed. Connections can be compliant, or they
    can be non-compliant for one of several reasons (not enough Signed
    Certificate Timestamps [SCTs], not diverse enough SCTs, or the build was old
    so CT compliance wasn't checked).
  </summary>

<histogram name="Security.ClientAuth.CertificateSelectionSource"
    enum="ClientCertSelectionResult" expires_after="2020-08-16">
  <owner>jdeblasio@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    When TLS client authentication is requested by the server, Chrome must
    choose whether to return a certificate or to abort the handshake. This
    histogram records how this determination was made, either as a result of
    user action, or as chosen automatically due to content settings. It only
    records when a fresh certificate selection would be attempted (and thus
    ignores cache hits). This histogram is recorded in SSLClientAuthObserver for
    user-selected outcomes and in ChromeContentBrowserClient for policy
    outcomes. This histogram does not cover mobile, as certificate handling is
    not handled by Chrome on Android nor iOS.

    Records whether the page would have a legacy TLS warning (if the user were
    in the appropriate field trial) when a download is initiated from the page
    (*not* the legacy TLS status of the download URL itself). This is recorded
    regardless of whether the warning is actually displayed. This histogram is
    not recorded for downloads that are initiated in a new tab or window, as the
    legacy TLS status of the initiating page cannot be tracked.

    Records whether the page would have a legacy TLS warning (if the user were
    in the appropriate field trial) when submitting a form. This is recorded
    whenever a form submission navigation begins. The recorded status is of the
    page the form was submitted from, not the one that the form targets.

    Records the security level of a page with a cryptographic scheme (e.g.

    can downgrade the security level). This histogram should be analyzed with
    care because each recorded security level is not necessarily user-visible:
    in particular, a page may commit as a secure level (SECURE, EV_SECURE,
    SECURE_WITH_POLICY_INSTALLED_CERT) but get quickly downgraded to NONE if it
    shows mixed content on load. Therefore the histogram values should be

    called again for the same document if the security level changes
    dynamically. Note that the security level can change very quickly after
    commit time, for example if the page includes a password field on load
    (which can downgrade the security level). This histogram should be analyzed
    with care because each recorded security level is not necessarily
    user-visible: in particular, a page may commit as NONE or WARNING but get
    quickly downgraded to WARNING or DANGEROUS, depending on field trial
    configuration, if it shows a password field on load. Therefore the histogram
