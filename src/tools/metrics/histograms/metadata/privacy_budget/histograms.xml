<histogram name="PrivacyBudget.ClockSkew.FetchLatency" units="ms"
    expires_after="2023-01-14">
  <owner>antoniosartori@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>dmcardle@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the duration of the network round-trip performed to fetch the time
    from the network server. Only recorded for background fetches, which are
    enabled only via a feature parameter (and disabled by default).
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PrivacyBudget.ClockSkew.FetchLatencyJitter" units="ms"
    expires_after="2023-01-14">
  <owner>antoniosartori@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>dmcardle@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the standard deviation of the last three fetch latencies (i.e. the
    durations of the last three network round-trip performed to fetch the time
    from the network server). Only recorded for background fetches, which are
    enabled only via a feature parameter (and disabled by default).

<histogram name="PrivacyBudget.ClockSkew.Magnitude.Negative" units="ms"
    expires_after="2023-01-14">
  <owner>antoniosartori@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>dmcardle@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the absolute value of the computed clock skew (local clock - remote
    clock), when negative. Only recorded for background fetches, which are
    enabled only via a feature parameter (and disabled by default).
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PrivacyBudget.ClockSkew.Magnitude.Positive" units="ms"
    expires_after="2023-01-14">
  <owner>antoniosartori@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>dmcardle@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records the computed clock skew (local clock - remote clock), when positive.
    Only recorded for background fetches, which are enabled only via a feature
    parameter (and disabled by default).
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="PrivacyBudget.Identifiability.FinchConfigValidationResult"
    enum="BooleanSuccess" expires_after="2022-10-12">
  <owner>antoniosartori@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>hasanka@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Indicates whether the Finch configuration for the privacy budget
    identifiability study was validated successfully.
