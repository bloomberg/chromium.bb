    The percent dropped frame is calculated for each sliding window of 1 second

    The sliding windows cover the duration of page-load (From start of page-load

    background). Note that this means that this metric will bias toward tabs
    that are closed more quickly, and might underreport tabs that remain open
    for a long duration.

    PercentDroppedFrames is measured by tracking the number of frames which were
    not displayed on screen out of the total number of frames expected to be
    produced and displayed. In other words, the lower this number is, the

  <summary>
    Tracks the maximum staleness value for all presentations for a particular
    sequence of frames (e.g. during scroll, animation, etc.). This is reported
    in various sub-metrics with suffixes describing the type of the sequence
    (e.g. TouchScroll etc.).

    Typically, a frame presentation is expected to last at least one vsync
    cycle, plus any number of additional vsync cycles if no updates are expected
    duration that time. If the presentation interval is prolonged due to reasons
    other than listed above, then that prolonged portion will be considered
    staleness for that frame.

    Note that this metric is reported only when there are sufficient number of
    frames (&gt;= 100). If there are sequences with fewer frames, then these are
    aggregated until there are enough frames to produce the metric.
