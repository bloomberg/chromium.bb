  <summary>
    Bookmarks are indexed by the terms in their titles and URLs. The omnibox
    bookmark provider uses this index to search for bookmarks that match the
    user input. A summary of the approach is:

    1) Split the user input into terms.

    2) For each term, find the index nodes matching the term. Nodes are minimal
    representations of bookmarks that will later be used to construct matches in
    step 5.

    3) Accumulate the nodes.

    3a) If the omnibox is interested only in title and URL matches, or if less
    than 2 terms are longer than a threshold, nodes are accumulated by
    intersection; i.e. only nodes matching every term will be accumulated.

    3b) If the omnibox is interested in path matches as well, nodes are
    accumulated by union with a limit to avoid accumulating too many nodes. If
    the limit is reached, intersection nodes will be appended and therefore
    guaranteed to be included.

    4) Sort the nodes.

    5) Construct bookmark matches from the nodes and the user input. Not all
    nodes will be converted to matches; there is both filtering and a cap.

    This process occurs each time the omnibox looks up bookmarks for an input;
    approximately once per character the user types and occasionally at other
    times, e.g. when the omnibox is focused.

    This histogram detects whether step 3a or 3b occurred.

    It is emitted exactly once per the omnibox's request for bookmark matches
    with a non-empty input.

    representations of bookmarks that will later be used to construct matches in
    step 5.

    3) Accumulate the nodes.

    3a) If the omnibox is interested only in title and URL matches nodes are
    accumulated by intersection; i.e. only nodes matching every term will be
    accumulated.

    3b) If the omnibox is interested in path matches as well, nodes are
    accumulated by union with a limit to avoid accumulating too many nodes. If
    the limit is reached, intersection nodes will be appended and therefore
    guaranteed to be included.

    4) Sort the nodes.

    5) Construct bookmark matches from the nodes and the user input. Not all
    nodes will be converted to matches; there is both filtering and a cap.

    This process occurs each time the omnibox looks up bookmarks for an input;
    approximately once per character the user types and occasionally at other
    times, e.g. when the omnibox is focused.
