<histogram name="Windows.ApplockerRunning" enum="Boolean" expires_after="M83">
  <owner>forshaw@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>wfh@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records if the APPID driver is running which indicates Applocker is enabled
    and running. This does not guarantee that Applocker is configured to enforce
    any rules. Reported once per browser session, on startup.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Windows.CetAvailable" enum="BooleanAvailable"
    expires_after="2022-12-01">
  <owner>ajgo@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>wfh@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records if CET (Control-flow Enforcement Technology / Hardware Enforced
    Shadow Stack) is available, based on IsUserCetAvailableInEnvironment().
    Reported once per browser session, on startup.
  </summary>
</histogram>

    expires_after="2022-12-01">
  <owner>ajgo@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>wfh@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records if CET (Control-flow Enforcement Technology / Hardware Enforced
    Shadow Stack) is enabled or if it has been disabled by IFEO. Reported only
    if CetAvailable is true, once per browser session, on startup. Note: This
    was recorded incorrectly in M91.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Windows.ChromeDllPrefetchResult" enum="FilePrefetchResult"
    expires_after="2022-06-26">

    fallback to slow prefetch took place, and why if so.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Windows.CreateOrUpdateShortcuts.Result"
    enum="CreateOrUpdateShortcutsResult" expires_after="2022-11-26">
  <owner>davidbienvenu@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>jessemckenna@google.com</owner>
  <summary>
    The result of creating or updating a Windows shortcut out of process.
    Recorded when Chrome creates or updates a Windows shortcut using
    shell_integration::win::CreateOrUpdateShortcuts, e.g., when a profile is
    added.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Windows.FileDeleteRetryCount" units="attempts"
    expires_after="2022-10-16">
  <owner>grt@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>davidbienvenu@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The number of retries needed to successfully delete a file from
    GetDeleteFileCallback. 0 means it succeeded the first time, 9 means it never
    succeeded.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Windows.HasHighResolutionTimeTicks" enum="Boolean"
    expires_after="2023-12-19">
  <owner>brucedawson@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>gab@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The value of TimeTicks::IsHighResolution(). Reported once per browser
    session, on startup.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Windows.HighResolutionTimerUsage" units="%"
    expires_after="2022-10-30">
  <owner>olivierli@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>catan-team@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Percentage of elapsed time the high resolution timer is activated. The usage
    is reported by each of Chrome processes individually (without aggregation)
    and logged every 10 minutes.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Windows.HypervPresent" enum="BooleanEnabled"
    expires_after="2022-10-01">
  <owner>rkc@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>rockot@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Whether Hyper-V is enabled on this machine. Logged shortly after startup.
    This metric will only be logged on Windows 10+.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Windows.InspectModule.ConnectionError"
    enum="BooleanConnectionError" expires_after="M81">
  <owner>pmonette@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Whether connection error has happened for the UtilWin service. Every time a
    connection is made to the service, a &quot;false&quot; value is reported to
    provide a baseline. Every time a mojo connection error happens, a
    &quot;true&quot; value is reported, which typically means the utility
    process crashed.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Windows.IsPinnedToTaskbar" enum="IsPinnedToTaskbarResult"

  </summary>
</histogram>

    expires_after="M85">
  <owner>pmonette@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Indicates whether a connection error occured between the browser and the
    shell handler process. This is usually caused by a crash in the utility

  <owner>chrdavis@microsoft.com</owner>
  <summary>
    Indicates whether Chrome is pinned to the Windows taskbar for the current
    user. Recorded shortly after startup. This is different from
    Windows.IsPinnedToTaskbar in that we do not check if the pin to taskbar verb
    is available on the shortcut and only relies on the shortcut existing in the
    User Pinned folder.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Windows.Menu.Win11Style" enum="BooleanWin11MenuStyle"

<histogram name="Windows.NativeWindowVisibility{NativeWindowVisibility}"
    units="windows" expires_after="2021-02-01">
  <owner>davidbienvenu@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>fdoray@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The number of Chrome browser windows in a given visibility state. This is
    computed using ComputeNativeWindowOcclusionStatus() and is recorded every 10
    minutes. {NativeWindowVisibility}
  </summary>
  <token key="NativeWindowVisibility">
    <variant name=""/>
    <variant name=".Hidden"
        summary="The native window is not visible because it is in a

  <owner>davidbienvenu@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>sky@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Indicates if the current workspace state of a window is cached or not. If
    it's known that the window is on the current workspace or not, then we can
    avoid the COM method call IsWindowOnCurrentVirtualDesktop. This is recorded
    in BrowserView::IsOnCurrentWorkspace. In general, the state should almost
    always be cached.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Windows.OOPSelectFileDialog.ProcessError" enum="BooleanError"
    expires_after="M82">
  <owner>pmonette@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Indicates whether a connection error occured between the browser and the
    shell handler process. This is usually caused by a crash in the utility
    process. This is logged every time SelectFile() function is called and the
    WinOOPSelectFileDialog feature is enabled.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Windows.ParentProcessNameHash" enum="ProcessNameHash"
    expires_after="never">

  <summary>
    A 32-bit value formed from combining the minor and patch level of the
    currently running Windows operating system as reported by GetVersionEx().
    E.g. &quot;Windows 10 OS Version 1809 (Build 17763.503)&quot; would be 17763
    (0x4563), combined with 503 (0x1F7) = 0x456301F7. If either minor or patch
    level exceeds the value that can fit in a 16-bit unsigned integer, then this
    histogram will report 0. Reported once, shortly after browser startup.
  </summary>
</histogram>

<histogram name="Windows.PatchLevelKernel32" enum="WindowsPatchLevel"
    expires_after="never">

  <owner>grt@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>davidbienvenu@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    The number of retries needed to fully delete a path recursively from
    GetDeletePathRecursivelyCallback. 0 means it succeeded the first time, 9
    means it never succeeded to fully delete the path and all of its contents
    (if the path named a directory).

    expires_after="2021-12-01">
  <owner>davidbienvenu@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>dfried@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Recorded each time the user starts a Windows touch drag drop of web
    contents. This is currently only used by the WebUI tab strip, where touch
    drag drop is enabled, to count the number of touch drags attempted.
    ::DoDragDrop occasionally blocks waiting for a right mouse button down
    followed by a move, which is detected by ::DoDragDrop not calling
    QueryContinueDrag for more than a second. This will be recorded as false.
    This stat will be used to determine how much of a real world problem this
    is.
