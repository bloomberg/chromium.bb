    A new version of &quot;Blink.Canvas.ToBlob.InitiateEncodingDelay&quot;

    This metric measures the time spent from initiating image encoding (jpeg or
    png) on idle task to the actual execution time of initiation, as part of a
    canvas.toBlob API call.

    This metric is useful in helping us adjust the IdleTaskStartTimeoutDelay in
    canvas.toBlob. When the initialization idle task is delayed for longer than
    IdleTaskStartTimeoutDelay, the browser will switch to a non-idle task to
    force initialization and encoding to occur on the main thread.

    also gathered into this histogram, because the logic flow is exactly the
    same as canvas.toBlob. It's worth to note that the values can come from idle
    tasks on either main or worker thread.

    Note: This metric drops reports on clients with low-resolution clocks, which
    means these reports will be biased against a portion of the population on
    Windows. See Windows.HasHighResolutionTimeTicks for the affected sample.

  <summary>
    A new version of &quot;Blink.Canvas.ToBlob.InitiateEncodingDelay&quot;
    (which will be allowed to expire) which allows for times &gt;10ms.

    This metric measures the total time spent on completing encoding all the
    rows of an image (jpeg or png), as part of a canvas.toBlob API call.
    Encoding occurs during one or more idle periods on the main thread and the
    waiting time of the next idle period is included in the measurement. If the
    code has swtiched to force encoding path, we will not measure the delay in
    this metric.

    This metric is useful in helping us adjust the IdleTaskCompleteTimeoutDelay
    in canvas.toBlob. When the encoding idle task is delayed for longer than
    IdleTaskCompleteTimeoutDelay, the browser will switch to a non-idle task to
    force encoding to happen on the main thread.

  <summary>
    Time spent on 2D canvas toDataURL API call divided by the square root of the

    The idea behind this unit is that the bigger the area of a canvas the longer

    performance regardless of the size of the canvas.

    Warning: This metric may include reports from clients with low-resolution

  <summary>
    Time taken to completely decode an image frame of the {Type} file format.
    This includes time spent in codec implementations but excludes time spent
    waiting for the network or file cache to deliver the source bytes.

    For incremental decoding, e.g. the source bytes involve multiple network
    events, only the final event (producing a complete image frame) triggers a
    histogram record, but that record holds the total time spent on that frame.

    Incomplete (partially decoded) image frames (e.g. navigating away from the
    web page before any of its images fully loaded) are not recorded here, but
    they still might be recorded in the separate Blink.DecodedImageType
    histogram if the partial decoding was able to determine width and height.

    An image's frames may be decoded more than once. If so, {Index}
    distinguishes whether every decode of every frame is tracked or just the
    first (not repeated) decode of the first (not later) frame.

    For an example of repeated (not first) decodes, when switching between tabs
    or scrolling a web page, a previously decoded frame may be discarded so that
    the backing memory can be re-used elsewhere. When that image comes back into
    view, its frame may need decoding again.

    For an example of later (not first) frames, animated images may produce
    multiple frames from a single img tag. Looping animations may be able to
    cache all of the decoded frames after the first playthrough but, if too big
    to cache, playing the loop continually may keep adding Every histogram
    records as uncached frames are repeatedly decoded.

    The Every {Index} correlates more with &quot;how much CPU time (which
    correlates with battery consumption) is spent overall in {Type}
    decoding&quot;. The First {Index} correlates more with &quot;how long until
    First Contentful Paint&quot;.

  <summary>
    Records usage of CSS properties used on a page, either statically or
    dynamically, from the time the page is initialised to when it is closed or
    navigated away from. Each property is counted at most once per page per view
    via PageLoadMetricsObserver.

    The first time a CSS property is parsed on a page, the histogram is updated
    to increment the counter. Each histogram bucket corresponds to a CSS
    property (eg. width, border-radius). The exception is the 'Total pages
    measured' bucket - this counts the number of pages that CSS properties were
    counted on. When a page navigation occurs the page count bucket is
    incremented and tracking of the set of which properties have been seen is
    reset.

    These numbers give the percentage of pages that use a CSS property. For
    example, if the 'border-radius' histogram bucket has a count of 250, and the
    page count bucket (i.e. bucket number 1) has a count of 1000 - this means
    that 1000 pages were recorded, and border-radius was used on 25% of those
    pages.

    Note that CSS properties used inside of SVG images are tracked separately in
    the Blink.UseCounter.SVGImage.CSSProperties histogram.

    As of M57 this histogram supercedes WebCore.FeatureObserver.CSSProperties.

    As of M69, Blink.UseCounter.AnimatedCSSProperties is moved from the blink
    side to the browser side.
