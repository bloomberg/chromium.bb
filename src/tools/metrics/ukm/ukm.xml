  <summary>
    Identifiability metrics are used to measure the diversity of web clients as
    observed by individual web sites.

    Browser or device fingerprinting uses differences in behaviors of web APIs
    as identifiers. The values collected under this event indicate the level of
    identifiability of these differences.

    Metrics recorded under this event are keyed based on parameters determined
    at runtime. Hence the metrics described in this file are not exhaustive.

    See
    //third_party/blink/public/common/privacy_budget/identifiability/identifiability_metric_builder.h
    for details on how the metrics hash is determined.

      aggregated across study parameter sets, this value can be changed to
      partition the results.

      The name suffix (.626) was chosen so that the resulting metric hash as
      determined by base::DigestForMetrics() has all 8 LSBs set to 0. Such a
      metric hash does not collide with any other metric hash generated by

    A record of some predicted value vs. an observation. If the prediction is
    for a regression-style task (e.g., &quot;predict a number&quot; rather than
    &quot;predict an enum value&quot;), then the predicted and observed values
    are the numeric values, scaled by default to be in the integer range 0-100.

    The exact scaling used depends on the particular regression problem. Please
    see the LearningTask structure for the task of interest to find out how it
    maps values into the [0, 100] output range.

    A record is created for every prediction separately.

    For example, in the MediaCapabilities experiments, each playback generates a
    record. The predicted / observed values are the ratio of dropped to decoded
    frames, expressed as a percentage scaled to 0-100.

  <summary>
    Watch time is defined as the amount of elapsed media time for audio+video
    media aggregated per player instance. A minimum of 7 seconds of unmuted,
    foreground media must be watched to start watch time monitoring. Watch time
    is checked on a regular basis and reported upon one of the stop events
    mentioned below or at player destruction if none occur prior.

    Any one of paused, hidden, or muted is sufficient to stop watch time metric
    reports. Each of these has a hysteresis where if the state change is undone
    within some time, the watch time will be counted as uninterrupted.

    Power events (on/off battery power) have a similar hysteresis, but unlike
    the aforementioned properties, will not stop metric collection.

    Native controls events have a similar behavior than power events.

    Each seek event will result in a new watch time metric being started and the
    old metric finalized as accurately as possible.
