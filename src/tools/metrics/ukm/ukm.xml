      True if the page loaded in the main frame is an AMP document (has an amp
      attribute in the html element). Will not be recorded for non-AMP frames.
      Note that most AMP documents are loaded in a subframe from a reader like
      Google Search; this metric measures sites that are using AMP as a

      frame was a non-same-document navigation. Should be near-zero when the
      main frame navigation is a same-document navigation and the AMP subframe
      was not prerendered.
    </summary>
  </metric>
  <metric name="SubFrame.PaintTiming.NavigationToFirstContentfulPaint">
    <summary>
      Measures the time in milliseconds from navigation timing's navigation
      start to the time when the page first paints content, in the AMP subframe.
      A contentful paint includes a paint of text, image, SVG, or canvas.
    </summary>
  </metric>
  <metric name="SubFrame.PaintTiming.NavigationToLargestContentPaint">
    <summary>
      Measures the time in milliseconds from navigation timing's navigation

  </metric>
  <metric name="SubFrameAmpPageLoad">
    <summary>

  <owner>dalecurtis@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Watch time is defined as the amount of elapsed media time for audio+video
    media aggregated per player instance. A minimum of 7 seconds of unmuted,
    foreground media must be watched to start watch time monitoring. Watch time
    is checked on a regular basis and reported upon one of the stop events
    mentioned below or at player destruction if none occur prior.

    Any one of paused, hidden, or muted is sufficient to stop watch time metric
    reports. Each of these has a hysteresis where if the state change is undone
    within some time, the watch time will be counted as uninterrupted.

    Power events (on/off battery power) have a similar hysteresis, but unlike
    the aforementioned properties, will not stop metric collection.

    Native controls events have a similar behavior than power events.

    Each seek event will result in a new watch time metric being started and the
    old metric finalized as accurately as possible.

    <summary>
      Records whether the PasswordAutofillAgent in the renderer manages to fill
      credentials as instructed by the browser or records a failure reason
      otherwise. Only the outcome of the first attempt to fill is recorded.

      0: Success

      1: No password element - The password element to be filled has not been
      found.

      2: Blocked by frame hierarchy - Filling only happens in iframes if all
      parent frames PSL-match the security origin of the iframe containing the
      password field.

      3: Password element is not autocompleteable - Passwords are not filled
      into fields that are not editable.

      4: Username prefilled with incompatible value - The username field
      contains a string that does not match the username of any available
      credential. This typically indicates placeholder values.

      5: Found no password for username - No credential was filled due to
      mismatches with the username. This can happen in a number of cases: In
      case the username field is empty and readonly. In case of a
      username-first-flow where a user's credentials do contain a username but
      the form contains only a password field and no username field. In case of
      change password forms that contain no username field. In case the user
      name is given on a page but only PSL matched credentials exist for this
      username. There may be further cases.

      6: Wait for username - Renderer was instructed to wait until user has
      manually picked a credential. This happens for example if the session is
      an incognito session, the credendial's URL matches the mainframe only via
      the PSL, the site is on HTTP, or the form has no current password field.
      Fill.FirstWaitForUsernameReason records the root causes.

      7: No fillable elements found - No fillable elements were found, only
      possible for the old form parser.

      This is replicated as PasswordManager.FirstFillingResultInRenderer in UMA.
    </summary>
  </metric>
  <metric name="Fill.FirstWaitForUsernameReason">
    <summary>
      This metric records why the browser instructs the renderer not to fill the
      credentials on page load but to wait for the user to confirm the
      credential to be filled. Only the value of the first decision to fill is
      recorded.

      0: Don't wait

      1: Incognito mode - User is browsing in incognito mode.

      2: Public suffix match - A credential exists for a PSL matched site but
      not for the current security origin.

      3: Form not good for filling - Form is suspected to be a password change
      form. (Only recorded for old form parser)

      4: FOAS on HTTP - User is on an HTTP site where passwords are filled on
      account selection (FOAS).

      This is replicated PasswordManager.FirstWaitForUsernameReason in UMA.
