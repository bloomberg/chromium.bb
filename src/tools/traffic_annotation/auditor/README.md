# Network Traffic Annotation Auditor
This binary runs extractor.py for extraction of Network Traffic Annotations
from chromium source code, collects and summarizes its outputs, and performs
tests and maintenance.
Please see `docs/network_traffic_annotations.md` for an introduction to network
traffic annotations.

## Usage
`traffic_annotation_auditor [OPTIONS]... [path_filter]...`

Extracts network traffic annotations from source files, tests them, and updates
`tools/traffic_annotation/summary/annotations.xml`. If path filter(s) are
specified, only those directories of the source will be analyzed.
Run `traffic_annotation_auditor --help` for options.

Example:
  `traffic_annotation_auditor --build-path=out/Debug`

The binary for this file is checked out into
`tools/traffic_annotation/bin/[platform]`. This is only done for Linux and
Windows platforms now and will be extended to other platforms later.

## Running
Before running, you need to build the COMPLETE chromium and pass the build path
to the executable.

## Safe List
If there are files, paths, or specific functions that need to be exempted from
all or some tests, they can be added to the `safe_list.txt`. The file is comma
separated, specifying the safe lists based on
`AuditorException::ExceptionType` in
`tools/traffic_annotation/auditor/traffic_annotation_auditor.h`.
Use * as wildcard for zero or more characters when specifying file paths.

Here are the exception types:
* `all`: Files and paths in this category are exempted from all tests.
* `missing`: Files and paths in this category can use the
  MISSING_TRAFFIC_ANNOTATION tag.
* `mutable_tag`: Files and paths in this category can use the
  CreateMutableNetworkTrafficAnnotationTag() function.
* `direct_assignment`: The functions in this category can assign a value
  directly to a MutableNetworkTrafficAnnotationTag. This is controlled to
  avoid assigning arbitrary values to mutable annotations.
* `test_annotation`: Files and paths in this category can use the
  TRAFFIC_ANNOTATION_FOR_TESTS tag.
