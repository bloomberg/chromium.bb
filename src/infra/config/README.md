**IMPORTANT:** If you see this in a branch which is not `master`,
**this directory has no effect and should be ignored.**

This directory contains chromium project-wide configurations
for Chrome Operations services.
For example, [cr-buildbucket.cfg](cr-buildbucket.cfg) defines builders.

**Remember** Change these configs on `master` branch only!

Currently active version can be checked at
https://luci-config.appspot.com/#/projects/chromium .

The configuration files are currently in the process of being migrated to
lucicfg/starlark. See
https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/luci/luci-go/+/HEAD/lucicfg/doc/README.md
for more information on lucicfg/starlark. If a hand-written configuration file
is still present alongside this file, you can modify that file directly.

The remainder of the configuration files are generated by starlark. The starlark
configuration is rooted in main.star and dev.star, which execute other starlark
files to generate a subset of the LUCI service configuration files to the
`generated` subdirectory. A presubmit check enforces that the generated files
are kept in sync with the generated output of the starlark configuration.

The starlark configuration also copies over the not-yet migrated files to the
`generated` directory, so updating the hand-written configuration files will
require re-'generating' the configuration.
