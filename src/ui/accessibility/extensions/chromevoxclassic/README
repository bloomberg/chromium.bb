# ChromeVox Classic

## Overview
ChromeVox Classic is a screen reader built utilizing only web api's available
through the use of a content script (e.g. DOM).

Over time, this project diverged from the approach taken by ChromeVox in Chrome
OS, which takes an approach closer to other OS-level screen readers which talk
to each renderering surface directly without direct knowledge of the specifics
within each renderer (due to an accessibility api abstraction).

## Building
This directly contains everything you need. It can be loaded into Chrome as an
unpacked extension and ready to use. Go to chrome://extensions, and click "Load
Unpacked".

## Maintenance/Contributions
Tooling is minimal for this fork of ChromeVox. Much of what's available for
ChromeVox in Chrome OS (chrome/browser/resources/chromeos/chromevox/tools is
applicable) including deps.js generation, but requires adaptation.

## Release/Testing
Load ChromeVox Classic on at least Mac and Linux Chrome. Verify web content and
the chrome of Chrome both speak (e.g. google.com, the address bar). These two
paths are verbalized using entirely different code paths.

Once confirmed, the entire directory can be uploaded once zipped to the Chrome
webstore.
