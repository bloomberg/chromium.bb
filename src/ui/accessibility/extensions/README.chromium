This directory contains accessibility extensions developed by the
Chrome team, not included with Chrome by default, but available via a
one-click install from the Settings page.

#
# Building
#

Right now only the colorenhancer needs to be built, because it has localized
strings. To build it:

ninja -C out/Release ui/accessibility/extensions

The built extensions will be in your out directory, e.g.:

out/Release/colorehancer

All other extensions should be zipped and uploaded to the webstore.

Note for chromevoxclassic:
see chromevoxclassic/README for further details.

#
# Instructions for publishing to the web store (new as of August 2019):
#

Googlers, you need to be a member of the chrome-a11y-extensions group:
https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/d/forum/chrome-a11y-extensions

Then visit the Chrome Web Store and you can manage the extension. Remember to
increment the version of each extension every time you update it.

#
# Script
#

This script can be used to programmatically update extensions. Proceed with caution,
only use this if you are already comfortable updating an extension manually, you have a
rollback plan, and you can take the time to understand the script.
