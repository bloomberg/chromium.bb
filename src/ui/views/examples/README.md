`views_examples` and `views_examples_with_content` are similar tools to show
all the views widgets with some varied styles. The latter has extra support to
`web_view` as well.

*To run either of the programs:*

`<output_dir>/<program> [--enable-examples=<example1,[example2...]>]`

*To get help from the programs:*

`<output_dir>/<program> --help` will print out the above usage info.

`<output_dir>/<program> --enable-examples` will print out all names of available
examples and execute as if all (the default) are specified.

The current available examples are listed below:
