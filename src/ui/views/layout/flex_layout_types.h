//
// This callback takes two parameters: a child view, and a set of size bounds
// representing the available space for that child view to occupy. The function
// returns the preferred size of the view within those bounds, which may exceed
// them if the child is not capable of shrinking to the specified size. The
// callback may also return an empty size, which means the child view can drop
// out of the layout. Not specifying either bound means there is an unlimited
// amount of room for the child view in that dimension (and the child view
// should probably use its preferred size).
//
// We provide the ability to use an arbitrary function here because some views
// have complex sizing behavior; for example, they may shrink stepwise as their
// internal elements drop out due to lack of space.

};

// Specifies how a view should flex (i.e. grow or shrink) within its parent as
// the available space changes. Flex specifications have three components:
//  - A |rule| which tells the layout manager how the child view resizes with
//    available space.
//  - A |weight| which specifies how much of the available space is allocated to
//    a child view that can flex. The percentage of space allocated is the
//    weight divided by the total weight of all views at this order (see below).
//  - An |order| which specifies the priority with which available space is
//    allocated. All available space is offered to child views at order 1, then
//    any remaining space is offered to order 2, and so forth.
//
// For example, say there are three child controls in a horizontal layout, each
// of which has a flex rule that allows it to be between 0 and 20 DIPs wide.
// Child A is at order 2 with weight 2, child B is at order 1 with weight 1, and
// child C is at order 2 and weight 1. The parent control is 50 DIPs across and
// has no margins.
//
// All 50 DIPs are offered to child B, since it is first in order. It consumes
// 20 DIPs, its maximum size. Of the remaining 30, 20 are offered to child A and
// 10 are offered to child C, each of which they take - the 2:1 ratio is due to
// the different weights. (Also note that, if there were another child at order
// 3, it would be offered zero DIPs and might choose not to display itself.)
