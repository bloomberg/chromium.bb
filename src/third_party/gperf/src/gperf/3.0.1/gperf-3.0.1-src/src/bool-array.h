/* A Bool_Array instance is a bit array of fixed size, optimized for being
   filled sparsely and cleared frequently.  For example, when processing
   tests/chill.gperf, the array will be:
     - of size 15391,
     - clear will be called 3509 times,
     - set_bit will be called 300394 times.
   With a conventional bit array implementation, clear would be too slow.
   With a tree/hash based bit array implementation, set_bit would be slower. */
