===========================

What is it?
-----------
Gperf: generate a perfect hash function from a key set

Description
-----------
GNU gperf is a perfect hash function generator. For a given list of
strings, it produces a hash function and hash table in the form of
C or C++ code, for looking up a value depending on the input string.
The hash function is perfect,' which means that the hash table has
no collisions, and the hash table lookup needs a single string
comparison only. GNU gperf is highly customizable. There are options
for generating C and C++ code, for emitting 'switch' statements or
nested 'ifs' instead of a hash table, and for tuning the algorithm
that gperf uses.

Compilation
-----------
The package has been compiled with GNU auto-tools, GNU make, and Mingw
(GCC for MS-Windows). Any differences from the original sources are given
in gperf-3.0.1-GnuWin32.diffs in gperf-3.0.1-src.zip. Libraries needed
for compilation can be found at the lines starting with 'LIBS = ' in the
Makefiles. Usually, these are standard libraries provided with Mingw, or
libraries from the package itself; 'gw32c' refers to the libgw32c package,
which provides MS-Windows substitutes or stubs for functions normally found in
Unix. For more information, see: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/compile.html
and http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libgw32c.htm.
