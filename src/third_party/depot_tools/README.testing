Most of the tests require a local Rietveld server.

To set this up:
Method 1: Let the presubmit script do the work for you.
   $ git cl presubmit

Method 2: Manual.
1) Check out a copy of Rietveld:
     $ svn checkout http://rietveld.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ rietveld
   (Use git-svn if you must, but man is it slow.)
2) Get the Google App Engine SDK:
   http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html
3) To run Rietveld you will need Django 1.0, which is not included
   with the App Engine SDK.  Go to http://www.djangoproject.com/download ,
   download a Django from the 1.0 series (it's in the sidebar on the right),
   untar it, then
     $ export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`/Django-1.0.4
4) Run Rietveld:
     $ /path/to/appengine/sdk/dev_appserver.py /path/to/rietveld
   (If using one of the App Engine launchers, be sure to use port 8080
   for this project.)

And then, finally, run the tests.
