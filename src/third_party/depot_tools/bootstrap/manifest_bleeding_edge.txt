# CIPD manifest for bootstrapping tools.
#
# We must install anything that we want included on PATH to a different
# subdirectory than Git, as Git's msys bash strips its root directory
# from PATH, hence the subdirs.
#
# If any paths or package layouts change, updates will be required in
# "win_tools.bat", "bootstrap.py" and "../bootstrap_python3" templates.
#
# "win_tools.bat" has a hard requirement that the Python packages contain the
# strings "cpython/" for Python 2 and "cpython3/" for Python 3, and ends with
# the CIPD tag "version:VERSION". It uses this to extract VERSION.
#
# "bootstrap_python3" has a hard requirement that the Python package contains
# the string "cpython3/" and ends with the CIPD tag "version:VERSION".
# It uses this to extract VERSION.
