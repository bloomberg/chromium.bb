.gitcookies problem report:

  .googlesource.com wildcard record detected:

    Chrome Infrastructure team recommends to list full host names explicitly.

  The following hosts were defined twice:

    dup.googlesource.com

  Credentials should come in pairs for Git and Gerrit hosts. These hosts are missing:

    gpartial-review.googlesource.com    but gpartial.googlesource.com defined
    partial.googlesource.com            but partial-review.googlesource.com defined

  The following Git hosts have differing credentials from their Gerrit counterparts:

    conflict.googlesource.com    git-example.google.com vs git-example.chromium.org

  These hosts likely use wrong identity:

    chrome-internal.googlesource.com    git-example.chromium.org but google.com recommended
    chromium.googlesource.com           git-example.google.com but chromium.org recommended

  You can manually remove corresponding lines in your ~/.gitcookies file and visit the following URLs with correct account to generate correct credential lines:

    https://chrome-internal-review.googlesource.com/new-password
    https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/new-password
    https://conflict-review.googlesource.com/new-password
    https://gpartial-review.googlesource.com/new-password
    https://partial-review.googlesource.com/new-password
