Description:
mock is a library for testing in Python. It allows you to replace parts of your
system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been
used. mock is now part of the Python standard library, available as
unittest.mock in Python 3.3 onwards.
mock provides a core Mock class removing the need to create a host of stubs
throughout your test suite. After performing an action, you can make assertions
about which methods / attributes were used and arguments they were called with.
You can also specify return values and set needed attributes in the normal way.
Additionally, mock provides a patch() decorator that handles patching module and
class level attributes within the scope of a test, along with sentinel for
creating unique objects. Mock is very easy to use and is designed for use with
unittest. Mock is based on the ‘action -> assertion’ pattern instead of
‘record -> replay’ used by many mocking frameworks. mock is tested on Python
versions 2.4-2.7, Python 3 plus the latest versions of Jython and PyPy.
