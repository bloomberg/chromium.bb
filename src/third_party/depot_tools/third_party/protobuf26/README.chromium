This directory contains google.protobuf module version 2.6.0 build 0.

sergiyb@: It has been manually renamed to protobuf26. This is needed to avoid
conflicts with a built-in google.protobuf module found on many developer
machines. The long-term solution to this problem was to use virtualenv and it
was implemented, but had to be reverted due to incompatibilities with ChromiumOS
builds (see http://crbug.com/542922).

If you need to update this package, please make sure that you replace all the
references to google.protobuf in the package itself with protobuf26, e.g.

  from google.protobuf import text_format
  import google.protobuf

becomes

  from protobuf26 import text_format
  import protobuf26

Original bug tracking setting up virtualenv for depot_tools was
http://crbug.com/503067, but it was closed as WontFix. If you believe that
virtualenv should be added to the current version of depot_tools, please re-open
that bug.
