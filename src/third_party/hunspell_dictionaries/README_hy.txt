This software was originally created in 2008. Being the only linguistically
complete Armenian spell-checker tool (in both Classical and Reformed
Orthographies), it was commercially available under "HySpell Armenian
Spell-Checker" name until June 2017. It was then made open source in order to
promote software development in the direction and advancement of the Armenian
language. For further information, as well as, further linguistic tools, please
