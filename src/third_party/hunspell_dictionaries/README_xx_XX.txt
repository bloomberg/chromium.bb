xx_XX Hunspell Dictionary
Version 2019.07.15

README file for Test Hunspell dictionaries. The affinity list was copied from
en_US.aff. In case we need to do more unit testing.

Currently, we are adding `typographit` as offensive (in the `xx_XX.dic`) which
should never be suggested and never be underlined as misspelled.
