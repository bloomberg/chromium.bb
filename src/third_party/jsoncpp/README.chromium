Description:
The libjingle/webrtc/liblouis_nacl uses jsoncpp for signaling message
serialization and deserialization. This library is also shipped in NaCl
SDK and used in several examples.

Local modifications:
The overrides are used to eliminate static initializers in json_value.cpp and
json_reader.cpp adds includes for <string> and <istream> to build on libc++
(https://llvm.org/PR25232), and to change some one-bit bit fields to unsigned
so that they can hold the '1' values that are stored in them.
