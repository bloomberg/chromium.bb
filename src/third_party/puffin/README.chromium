Description:
Puffin is a deterministic deflate recompressor. It is mainly used for patching
deflate compressed images (zip, gzip, etc.) because patches created from deflate
files/streams are usually large (deflate has a bit-aligned format, hence,
changing one byte in the raw data can cause the entire deflate stream to change
drastically.) Specifically in chromium/src, this library is needed in order for
Omaha, chrome's auto-updater client, to support puffin-generated diffs created
by Omaha Server.

Local Modifications:
- Updated OWNERS to reflect our team as the owners.
- Removed BUILD.gn taken from AOSP as it doesn't build in chromium.
- removed PRESUBMIT.cfg and PREUPLOAD.cfg
- Adding a DEPS file so we can pass presubmit checks.
- removed BSDiff as we only require the zucchini version of puffdiff/puffpatch
- rewrote the commandline usage for the puffin binary as we only need to support
    and test puffdiff and puffpatch.
- Replaced POSIX file IO with chromium/src's base::File/base::FilePath methods
    so it will build and run cross-platform.
- Removed dependence of libpuffpatch on libpuffdiff as the puffin patching
    service we plant to implement only requires libpuffpatch.
