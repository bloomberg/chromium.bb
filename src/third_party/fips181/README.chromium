Description:

A C library that provides an implementation of FIPS 181 Automated Password
Generator (APG).

Local Modifications:

pronpass.c and pronpass.h were imported as files fips181.cc and fips181.h.

owntypes.h was removed and the calling code changed to use standard C99/C++
types. (At least 1 typedef (UINT32) conflicted with the same typedef in
windows.h.) Although the upstream code is vanilla C, bool is available without
stdbool.h here because we compile the code as C++. Vanilla C users must include
that header.

Additionally, some variables and a function (is_restricted_symbol) have had
their types changed from int to bool (they were being used as bools). This
allows us to build the code warning-free in MSVC (warning C4805).
