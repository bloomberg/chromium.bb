[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/swiftshader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/swiftshader) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/yrmyvb34j22jg1uj?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/c0d1f1ed/swiftshader)

SwiftShader is a high-performance CPU-based implementation of the OpenGL ES and Direct3D 9 graphics APIs<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>. Its goal is to provide hardware independence for advanced 3D graphics.

Usage
-----

The SwiftShader libraries act as drop-in replacements for graphics drivers.

On Windows, most applications can be made to use SwiftShader's DLLs by placing them in the same folder as the executable. On Linux, the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable or -rpath linker option can be used to direct applications to search for shared libraries in the indicated directory first.

Prebuilt binaries can be found at: https://goo.gl/5MOcdb

Third-Party Dependencies
------------------------

The [third_party](third_party/) directory contains projects which originated outside of SwiftShader:

[LLVM](third_party/LLVM/) contains an outdated and diverged copy of the [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) compiler framework. Until further notice, maintenance fixes can be made directly in the SwiftShader repository.

[subzero](third_party/subzero/) contains a fork of the [Subzero](https://chromium.googlesource.com/native_client/pnacl-subzero/) project. It is part of Google Chrome's (Portable) [Native Client](https://developer.chrome.com/native-client) project. Its authoritative source is at [https://chromium.googlesource.com/native_client/pnacl-subzero/](https://chromium.googlesource.com/native_client/pnacl-subzero/). The fork was made using [git-subtree](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/subtree/git-subtree.txt) to include all of Subzero's history, and until further notice it should **not** diverge from the upstream project. Contributions must be tested using the [README](third_party/subzero/docs/README.rst) instructions, reviewed at [https://chromium-review.googlesource.com](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/project:native_client%252Fpnacl-subzero), and then pulled into the SwiftShader repository.

[llvm-subzero](third_party/llvm-subzero/) contains a minimized set of LLVM dependencies of the Subzero project.

[PowerVR_SDK](third_party/PowerVR_SDK/) contains a subset of the [PowerVR Graphics Native SDK](https://github.com/powervr-graphics/Native_SDK) for running several sample applications.

[googletest](third_party/googletest/) contains the [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) project, as a Git submodule. It is used for running unit tests for Chromium, and Reactor unit tests. Run `git submodule update --init` to obtain/update the code. Any contributions should be made upstream.
