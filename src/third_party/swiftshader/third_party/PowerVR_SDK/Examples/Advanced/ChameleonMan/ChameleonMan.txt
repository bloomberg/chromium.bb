:FullDescription:	
The ChameleonMan demo shows a Matrix Skinned Character in combination with bump mapping. 

Matrix Skinning is the act of animating a vertex over time given a set (palette) of matrices and a known set of blend weights assigned to those matrices. The ChameleonMan model has 19 bones and an animation cycle of 16 frames. 

For each frame the Matrix Palette is recomputed based on time. For example to render the model at time point 5.25 the application would linearly blend between the matrices stored for frame 5 and 6 using weights of 0.75 and 0.25 respectively. 

Per vertex, up to 3 matrices, from the palette, along with 3 weights are used by the vertex shader to update the vertex position to obtain the current animation frame position. 

Two lighting modes are available:
	-	per vertex lighting
	-	bump mapped lighting

Controls:
	-	1	-	Toggle lighting modes
	-	Esc	-	Close the application
