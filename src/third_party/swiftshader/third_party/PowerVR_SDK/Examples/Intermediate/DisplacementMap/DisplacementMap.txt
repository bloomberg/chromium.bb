:FullDescription:
This training course demonstrates displacement mapping using a texture read from the vertex shader. A tesselated grid of vertices is displaced by differing amounts as dictated by the value read from the texture.
Displacement mapping is an alternative to bump mapping, normal mapping, and parallax mapping, that causes the actual geometric position of points over a textured surface to be displaced, often along the local surface normal, according to the value the texture function evaluates to at each point on the surface. It gives surfaces a great sense of depth and detail, permitting self-occlusion, self-shadowing and silhouettes.
Additional geometry is requried in order for the effect to be achieved and thus performance will be affected.
