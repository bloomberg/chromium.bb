Description:
After fetching from Google storage, the data/ folder contains a filter list
derived from EasyList. It is used for the Subresource Filter, as described at
https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/subresource_filter/README.md

Local Modifications:
The filter list is processed to reduce its size substantially. We include the
unindexed version of this smaller ruleset. The full process is described at
https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/components/subresource_filter/FILTER_LIST_GENERATION.md
