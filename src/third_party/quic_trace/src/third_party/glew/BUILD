# The source version of GLEW 2.1.0 is a custom, reduced-size version that only
# contains the extensions we need (otherwise, GLEW takes up more than a
# megabyte in source code).  How to rebuild it:
#   1. Get a copy of GLEW source
#   2. Copy custom.txt into auto/ directory.
#   3. Run `make custom` in auto/ directory.
#   4. Copy the resulting files.
