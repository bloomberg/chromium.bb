Description:
The NEON_2_SSE.h file is intended to simplify ARM->IA32 porting. It makes the
correspondence (or a real porting) of ARM NEON intrinsics as defined in
"arm_neon.h" header and x86 SSE (up to SSE4.2) intrinsic functions as defined
in corresponding x86 compilers headers files.

Local Modifications:
- Included only the NEON_2_SSE.h file.
