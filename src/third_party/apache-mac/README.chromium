Description:

This is a checked-in copy of Apache2 with OpenSSL, PHP, and dependencies for
Mac. It is used by the Blink layout tests. Binaries are built from:

apr 1.6.5
apr-util 1.6.1
httpd 2.4.38
openssl 1.1.1b
pcre 8.42
php 7.3.3
zlib 1.2.11

To update, use the build-apache-mac.sh script.

   mkdir tmp
   cd tmp
   /path/to/build-apache-mac.sh

The files will be placed in the out directory. Copy these over and upload the
executables and DLLs to Google Storage, to the chromium-apache-mac bucket.
See http://g.co/bugatrooper in order to get permission to upload. Upload all
binaries with:

  find bin lib libexec -type f -not -name '*.sha1' | upload_to_google_storage.py --bucket chromium-apache-mac -

Optionally, prune the files that were uploaded and run gclient runhooks to
verify that they are re-downloaded. Remember to clean up any temp files used in
the above process before uploading a CL. The CL should contain sha1 files but
not actual binaries.
