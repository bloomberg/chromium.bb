  // and from messages like this one under various conditions (broker relays,
  // different transport mechanisms, etc.), parcels are tagged with strictly
  // increasing SequenceNumbers by the sender. This field informs the recipient
  // that the closed endpoint has transmitted exactly `sequence_length` parcels,
  // from SequenceNumber 0 to `sequence_length-1`. The recipient can use this
  // to know, for example, that it must still expect some additional parcels to
  // arrive before completely forgetting about the route's link(s).
