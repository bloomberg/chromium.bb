// The Router is the main primitive responsible for routing parcels between ipcz
// portals. This class is thread-safe.
//
// Before a Router can participate in any actual routing, it must have an
// outward link to another Router (see SetOutwardLink()). To establish a locally
// connected pair of Routers, pass both to LocalRouterLink::ConnectRouters(),
// which internally calls SetOutwardLink() on both:
//
//     Router::Pair routers = {MakeRefCounted<Router>(),
//                             MakeRefCounted<Router>()};
//     LocalRouterLink::ConnectRouters(LinkType::kCentral, routers);
//
// Each ipcz Portal directly controls a terminal Router along its route, and
// all routes stabilize to eventually consist of only two interconnected
// terminal Routers. When a portal moves, its side of the route is extended by
// creating a new terminal Router at the portal's new location. The previous
// terminal Router remains as a proxying hop to be phased out eventually.
