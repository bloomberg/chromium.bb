Building using the SDK and NDK
------------------------------

To build and install glmark2 you need the Android SDK and NDK. The 'android',
'adb' and 'ndk-build' tools used below are included there.

To build glmark2 for Android we start by building the native part:

$ cd android
$ ndk-build

To continue building the package from the command line:

$ android update project -p . -s -t <target> (where target, e.g., android-10)
$ ant debug {or release}

To install to a device, you need to have set up an ADB connection
to the device. Then do:

$ adb install bin/Glmark2-debug.apk

Alternatively you can load the project (in the android/ directory) in Eclipse
using the ADT plugin and manage the build and install process from there.  Keep
in mind that when updating the native build (ndk-build etc) you need to refresh
the Eclipse project, otherwise it won't notice that something has changed.

Building using the Android build system
---------------------------------------

Copy the glmark2 source tree to somewhere the Android build system can access
it (eg external/glmark2) and build the GLMark2 module:

$ make GLMark2
