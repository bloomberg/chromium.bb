libmatrix
=========

A simple C++ template library that provides containers and arithmetic 
operations for vectors, matrices and matrix stacks of 2, 3 and 4 dimensions.
Additionally, it provides implementations of the more common matrix 
transformations described by the OpenGL programming guide.  libmatrix does
not make any OpenGL calls, it merely replaces a portion of the fixed-function
vertex processing API that have been removed from newer releases of core OpenGL
and omitted from OpenGL ES.  The goal is simply to provide developers an easier
point of entry into developing for OpenGL and OpenGL ES.
