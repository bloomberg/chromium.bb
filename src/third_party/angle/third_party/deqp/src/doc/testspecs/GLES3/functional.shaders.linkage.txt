    Program linking tests

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES3.functional.shaders.linkage.*

Includes:
 + Varying linking rules
   - Negative and allowed cases
 + Uniform linking rules
 + Uniform buffer object linking rules
 + Float, float-vector and matrix varyings
 + Integer and int-vector varyings
 + Flat and centroid varyings

Excludes:
 + Varying arrays
   - Covered in functional.shaders.indexing group
 + Interpolation rules for varyings
   - Will be covered in primitive rendering tests (2012.2)
 + Rendering tests for uniform buffer objects
   - Covered in separate uniform buffer object tests

Description:

Shader execution tests render a grid of quads filling entire viewport with
the shader being tested. Fragment shader includes a comparison against
pre-computed reference. Fragment color is either white or black depending
on whether the result were correct or not.

Negative tests try to compile the given shader and expect compilation
to fail.
