    Fragment output tests

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES3.functional.frag_output.*

Includes:
 + All valid scalar and vector output types
 + Conversion to signed and unsigned fixed point formats
 + Multiple outputs
   - Implies multiple render targets
 + Array outputs
 + Negative tests for fragment shader output declarations

Excludes:
 + Negative API tests

Description:

Fragment output tests render a single quad that fills the entire viewport.
Each test case uses one or more output variables. Values for floating-point
output values are interpolated from per-vertex data. For integer outputs
no interpolation is done and flat values are used instead.

Each shader output is matched with a framebuffer. For floating-point targets
framebuffer can be either default framebuffer, renderbuffer with floating-point
format or normalized fixed point format depending on the test case. For
integer outputs renderbuffer with compatible integer format is always used.

Resulting image is read from all render targets and compared against
reference(s) produced by reference rendering code.
