	Fence sync tests

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES3.functional.fence_sync.*

Includes:
 + Creating and deleting sync objects
 + Calling glWaitSync
	- With varying number of primitive draws
 + Calling glClientWaitSync and verifying return values
	- With varying number of primitive draws
	- With varying timeouts
	- Flushing or finishing before wait

Description:

Fence sync functionality is tested by drawing a small or large number of
primitives with glDrawArrays(). Then a sync object is created, and
optionally glFlush() or glFinish() are called.

Wait is then performed with either glWaitSync() or glClientWaitSync(), and
different timeout values as well as the flag GL_SYNC_FLUSH_COMMANDS_BIT
are tested. Finally, errors are checked and the return value of
glClientWaitSync() is verified.

The testcase fails if errors are created or if glClientWaitSync() returns
GL_WAIT_FAILED. Additionally, if glFinish() was called before wait, return
value is required to be GL_ALREADY_SIGNALED.
