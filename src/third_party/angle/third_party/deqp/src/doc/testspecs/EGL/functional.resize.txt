    Title

Tests:
 + dEQP-EGL.functional.resize.*

Includes:
 + EGL_WIDTH and EGL_HEIGHT
 + Preservation of back buffer contents
 + EGL_*_RESOLUTION consistency

Excludes:
 + Preservation of front buffer contents

Description:

Checks for EGL surface behavior when the surface's native window is resized by external means.

The surface_size.* tests resize the native window and call
eglSwapBuffers(). Then EGL_WIDTH and EGL_HEIGHT are checked to verify
that they report the new native window size.

The back_buffer.* tests create an EGL_BUFFER_PRESERVED surface and draw
a test image on it. The native window is resized, and the back buffer is
checked to see that it is similar to the original test image in some
corner.

The pixel_density.* tests query the EGL_HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION and
EGL_VERTICAL_RESOLUTION attributes of the surface both before and after
resizing. These are compared to the size of the native image in physical
display pixels. An error is reported if the results are inconsistent,
i.e. if they imply that the size of a physical display pixel changed
size during resizing.
