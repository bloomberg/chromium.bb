    Sampler tests

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES2.functional.texture.sampler.*

Includes:
 + Creating and deleting sampler objects
 + Setting sampler parameters
 + Binding samplers to texture units
   - Single unit
   - Multiple units
 + Verify that sampler state supercedes texture state

Excludes:
 + Negative API tests
   - Will be added in 2012.3 release
 + Sampler queries
   - Will be added in 2012.4 release

Description:

Sampler tests construct a sampler object with selected parameters. Sampler
is then bound to one or more texture units populated with textures that
have random texture parameters set. Image is then rendered combining samples
from all of the textures.

Rendered image is compared against a reference image produced by a reference
renderer.
