    Framebuffer blit tests

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES3.functional.fbo.blit.*

Includes:
 + Copying whole framebuffer
 + Copying sub-framebuffer
 + Scaling in copy
   - Nearest and linear filtering
 + Copying depth values
 + Copying stencil values
 + All supported conversions
 + Pixel ownership test
 + Scissor test
 + sRGB conversion

Excludes:
 + Negative tests
   - Will be covered in separate negative API test set
 + MSAA resolve in glBlitFramebuffer()
   - Covered in MSAA FBO tests

Description:

Framebuffer blit tests will create two framebuffers with configurations
defined by the test case. Both are initialized with color, depth and
stencil data. A copy defined by the test case is performed between first
and second framebuffer. If depth and/or stencil values were copied,
a rendering command that will use the copied depth/stencil values is
submitted to the target framebuffer.

Rendered image is compared against a reference image computed by a reference
rendering code.
