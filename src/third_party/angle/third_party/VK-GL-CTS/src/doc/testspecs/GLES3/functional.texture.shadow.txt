    Shadow compare tests

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES3.functional.texture.shadow.*

Includes:
 + All depth comparison modes
 + Texture formats with depth and depth_stencil internal formats
 + All texture filtering modes with minification and magnification.
 + 2D, 2D array and cube map textures

Excludes:

Description:

Shadow compare tests render two adjecent quads. Left one has texture
coordinates choosed to trigger minification while right one tests
magnification. Reference value for depth comparison is uniform.

The rendered image is compared against a reference that is produced by
reference renderer. A simple threshold-based comparison is used.

In tests where filtering mode is not NEAREST or NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST
all r values are accepted if reference image contains r that is not
exactly 0 or 1. Reference is computed using executing comparisons
for all texels and combining results in same fashion as in regular
texture lookups.
