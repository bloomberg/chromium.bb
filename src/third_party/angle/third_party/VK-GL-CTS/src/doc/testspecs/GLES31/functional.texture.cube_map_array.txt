    Texture specification

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES31.functional.texture.format.*cube_array*
 + dEQP-GLES31.functional.texture.specification.*cube_array*

Includes:
 + Creating and sampling from cube map arrays
 + All formats
 + Various methods for specifying cube map array contents
   - TexImage3D
   - TexSubImage3D
   - Uploads from pixel buffer objects
 + Immutable cube map arrays (TexStorage3D)

Excludes:
 + Strict texture filtering validation
   - Will be added in 2014.3 release
 + Rendering into cube map arrays
   - Will be added in 2014.3 release
 + Negative tests
   - Will be added in 2014.4 release

Description:

Tests perform a set of API calls that create and specify cube map array
texture. Depending on the case texture is sampled one or more times.
Specification tests go through all levels, faces, and layers.

The result images are checked against a reference image rendered by a
reference implementation.
