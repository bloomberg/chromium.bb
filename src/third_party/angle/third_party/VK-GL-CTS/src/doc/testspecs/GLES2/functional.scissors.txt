    Scissoring Tests

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES2.functional.scissor.*
 + dEQP-GLES3.functional.scissor.*

Includes:
 + Primitives
   - Points
   - Lines
   - Triangles
 + Clears (including GLES 3 only ones)
 + Framebuffer blits (GLES 3)
 + Scissor configurations
   - Enclosing rendered area
   - Enclosed by rendered area (if applicable)
   - Partially containing rendered area
   - (Partially) outside render target


Excludes:
 + Blits to/from multiple buffers
 + Partially clipped points

Description:

This test set compares images rendered by the target with the scissor test
enabled to references generated with the scissor test disabled but with
areas outside the scissor rectangle cleared by the test logic.

All primitive types are tested in all reasonable scissor configurations
listed above. Points are tested in a somewhat limited fashion since
support for point sizes above one is not required.

After clearing with scissoring enabled, depth and stencil clears disable
scissoring and render a colored fullscreen quad with depth & stencil
tests requiring values set by the previous clears to produce the final output.
