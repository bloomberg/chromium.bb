    Sampler tests

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES2.functional.texture.sampler.*

Includes:
 + glTexImage3D(), glTexImage2D(), glTexSubImage3D(), glTexSubImage2D()
   - Selected texture formats
   - Randomized usage
 + glCopyTexImage2D(), glCopyTexSubImage2D()
   - All texture formats
   - Randomized usage
 + glTexStorage2D() and glTexStorage3D()
   - All formats
   - 2D, 2D array, cube map and 3D textures
 + All pixel transfer modes
 + Specifying textures from pixel buffer objects

Excludes:
 + Texture formats are more thoroughly exercised in texture format tests
 + Negative API tests
   - Will be added in 2012.3

Description:

Texture specification tests create a complete texture object using texture
specification APIs. The exact functions called depends on the feature being
tested. All texture levels, faces (for cube maps) and slices (for 2D array
textures and 3D textures) are then rendered and compared against a image produced
by a reference renderer.
