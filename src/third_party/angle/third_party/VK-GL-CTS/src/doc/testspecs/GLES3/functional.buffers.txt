    Buffer management and data transfer tests

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES3.functional.buffers.*

Includes:
 + Creating and destroying buffers
 + Mapping buffers
   - Reading and writing to buffers
   - MAP_INVALIDATE_RANGE_BIT
   - MAP_INVALIDATE_BUFFER_BIT
   - MAP_FLUSH_EXPLICIT_BIT
   - MAP_UNSYNCHRONIZED_BIT
 + Copying buffers
 + Data verification by using buffer in rendering
 + Data verification using buffer mapping

Excludes:
 + Writing buffer data with glBufferData, glBufferSubData
   - Will be covered in 2012.3 release
 + Negative API tests
   - Will be covered in separate negative API test set

Description:

Buffer tests perform a sequence of API calls that modify the buffer data.
All buffer-related calls are written to log for inspection.

Buffer contents are verified by either mapping buffer for reading or using
buffer in rendering as a vertex array, uniform buffer or pixel unpack buffer.
Results are compared against reference data or reference rendering.
