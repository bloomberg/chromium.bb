    Multisample framebuffer object tests

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES3.functional.fbo.msaa.*

Includes:
 + Creating framebuffer objects with multisample color, depth and stencil buffers
 + All specification-mandated color, depth and stencil formats
 + Basic rendering to MSAA framebuffer objects
 + Minimum of 1, 4 and 8 samples
 + Multisample resolve in glBlitFramebuffer()

Excludes:
 + Coverage value computation in primitive rasterization
   - Will be covered in primitive rasterization test set (2012.2)

Description:

Each test case exercises a combination of sample count and color, depth
and stencil renderbuffer formats. Simple scene is rendered to the framebuffer
object in such way that all allocated buffers will be exercised. Multisampled
colorbuffer contents are then resolved to non-multisampled renderbuffer
using glBlitFramebuffer() and read from there using glReadPixels().

Resulting image is compared agaist an image produced by a reference renderer.
