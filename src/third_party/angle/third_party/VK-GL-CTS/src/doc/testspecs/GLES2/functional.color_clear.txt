    Color buffer clears

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES2.functional.color.clear.*

Includes:
 + Full-screen color buffer clears: glClear(), glClearColor()
 + glScissor() effect on color buffer clears
 + glColorMask() effect on color buffer clears
 + Combined glScissor() and glColorMask() effect

Excludes:
 + glViewport() effect on color buffer clears
 + Out-of-rande inputs for glClearColor()
 + Depth and stencil buffer clears

Description:

Color clear tests are organized based on the feature set used in the
test case. Each test case performs multiple iterations, each consisting
of multiple color clears. Parameters, such as color, scissor rectangle
or color mask are chosen using deterministic random number generator.

Results are verified by building a reference image and comparing it
against the rendered image at the end of each iteration.
