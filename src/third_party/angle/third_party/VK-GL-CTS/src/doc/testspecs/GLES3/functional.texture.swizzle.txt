    Texture swizzle tests

Tests:
 + dEQP-GLES3.functional.texture.swizzle.*

Includes:
 + All texture swizzle modes applied separately for each channel
 + Randomized swizzle mode combinations
 + RED, RG, RGB, RGBA, A, L, LA texture formats

Excludes:

Description:

Texture format tests render a single quad, consisting of two triangles.
The viewport is configured to match the texture size. Texture coordinates
yield a 1:1 mapping from texels to framebuffer pixels. Thus filtering
shouldn't affect the final rendered image.

The rendered image is compared against a reference that is produced by
reference renderer. A simple threshold-based comparison is used.
