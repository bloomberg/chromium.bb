Number

    EGL Extension #XXX

Extension Type

    EGL device extension

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the language of EGL 1.5 as
    modified by EGL_EXT_device_query.

    EGL_EXT_device_query is required.

Overview

    ANGLE has the ability to run GPU commands on a native Vulkan device.
    This extension defines a mapping from an EGL device to a Vulkan
    device, after it's queried from an EGL display.

IP Status

    No known claims.

New Types

    None.

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

New Tokens

    Accepted as a queried <attribute> in eglQueryDeviceAttribEXT:

        EGL_VULKAN_DEVICE_ANGLE              0x34A8
        EGL_VULKAN_EXTENSIONS_ANGLE          0x34A9
        EGL_VULKAN_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_ANGLE     0x34AA
        EGL_VULKAN_QUEUE_ANGLE               0x34AB
        EGL_VULKAN_QUEUE_FAMILIY_INDEX_ANGLE 0x34AC

Add a new section 2.1.3 (Vulkan Devices) after 2.1.2 (Devices)

    Somewhat analogous to an EGL device, a Vulkan device establishes a
    namespace for Vulkan operations. In the Vulkan APIs, such devices are
    represented by pointers. For more details, see the Vulkan
    documentation.

Changes to section 3.2 (Devices)

    Replace the paragraph immediately following the prototype for
    eglQueryDeviceAttribEXT:

    <attribute> may be EGL_VULKAN_DEVICE_ANGLE.
    On success, EGL_TRUE is returned, and a valid Vulkan device handle VkDevice
    corresponding to the EGL device is returned in <value>. This handle
    is compatible with Vulkan API functions. If the EGL device is not currently
    associated with a Vulkan device and <attribute> is EGL_VULKAN_DEVICE_ANGLE,
    EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE is returned, and <value> is left unchanged.

    <attribute> may be EGL_VULKAN_EXTENSIONS_ANGLE.
    On success, EGL_TRUE is returned, and a pointer to a null terminated static
    string array is returned in <value>. The array contains enabled Vulkan
    device extensions for the Vulkan device used by the display.
    If the EGL device is not currently associated with a Vulkan device and
    <attribute> is EGL_VULKAN_EXTENSIONS_ANGLE, EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE is returned,
    and <value> is left unchanged.

    <attribute> may be EGL_VULKAN_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_ANGLE.
    On success, EGL_TRUE is returned, and a valid Vulkan physical device handle
    VkPhysicalDevice corresponding to the EGL device is returned in <value>.
    This handle is compatible with Vulkan API functions.
    If the EGL device is not currently associated with a Vulkan device and
    <attribute> is EGL_VULKAN_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_ANGLE, EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE
    is returned, and <value> is left unchanged.

    <attribute> may be EGL_VULKAN_QUEUE_ANGLE.
    On success, EGL_TRUE is returned, and a valid Vulkan device queue handle
    VkQueue corresponding to the EGL device is returned in <value>.
    This handle is compatible with Vulkan API functions.
    If the EGL device is not currently associated with a Vulkan device and
    <attribute> is EGL_VULKAN_QUEUE_ANGLE, EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE is returned,
    and <value> is left unchanged.

    <attribute> may be EGL_VULKAN_QUEUE_FAMILIY_INDEX_ANGLE.
    On success, EGL_TRUE is returned, and the Vulkan queue familiy index
    corresponding to the EGL device is returned in <value>.
    If the EGL device is not currently associated with a Vulkan device and
    <attribute> is EGL_VULKAN_QUEUE_FAMILIY_INDEX_ANGLE, EGL_BAD_ATTRIBUTE
    is returned, and <value> is left unchanged.
