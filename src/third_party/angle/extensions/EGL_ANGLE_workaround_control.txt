    EGL Extension #XXX

Extension Type

    EGL device extension

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the wording of the EGL 1.4
    Specification.

Overview

    This extension defines a method to query a string describing
    properties of the EGL client or of an EGL display connection
    which are looked up via the property name and index.

IP Status

    No known claims.

New Types

    None.

New Procedures and Functions

    const char *eglQueryStringiANGLE(
        EGLDisplay dpy,
        EGLint name,
        EGLint index);

New Tokens

    Accepted as a queried <name> in eglQueryStringiANGLE:

        EGL_WORKAROUND_NAME_ANGLE          0x3460
        EGL_WORKAROUND_CATEGORY_ANGLE      0x3461
        EGL_WORKAROUND_DESCRIPTION_ANGLE   0x3462
        EGL_WORKAROUND_BUG_ANGLE           0x3463
        EGL_WORKAROUND_ENABLED_ANGLE       0x3464

Additions to the EGL 1.5 Specification

    Add the following to the end of section 3.3 "EGL Queries":

        const char *eglQueryStringiANGLE(EGLDisplay dpy,
            EGLint name, EGLint index);

    eGLQueryStringiANGLE returns a pointer to a static, zero-
    terminated string describing some aspect of the EGL
    implementation running on the specified display, from an array of
    strings. name may be one of EGL_WORKAROUND_NAME_ANGLE,
    EGL_WORKAROUND_CATEGORY_ANGLE, EGL_WORKAROUND_DESCRIPTION_ANGLE,
    EGL_WORKAROUND_BUG_ANGLE, or EGL_WORKAROUND_ENABLED_ANGLE. Index
    must be a valid index to access into the array of strings.
        The EGL_WORKAROUND_NAME_ANGLE array contains strings that
    describe the name of each workaround available in the display.
        The EGL_WORKAROUND_CATEGORY_ANGLE array contains strings
    with corresponding indices to the array of names. Each string
    describes the category of the workaround at the specified index.
        The EGL_WORKAROUND_DESCRIPTION_ANGLE array contains strings
    with corresponding indices to the array of names. Each string
    describes the workaround at the specified index.
        The EGL_WORKAROUND_BUG_ANGLE array contains strings
    with corresponding indices to the array of names. Each string
    describes the bug related to the workaround at the specified
    index.
        The EGL_WORKAROUND_ENABLED_ANGLE array contains strings
    with corresponding indices to the array of names. Each string has
    the value "true" if the workaround is currently enabled, or
    "false" if the workaround is currently disabled.

    Errors

    On failure, NULL is returned.
    An EGL_BAD_DISPLAY error is generated if dpy is not a valid
    display.
    An EGL_BAD_PARAMETER error is generated if name is not one of the
    values described above.
    An EGL_BAD_PARAMETER error is generated if index is not within
    the valid range of indices for the array.

Issues

    None
