Description:
Hyphenation patterns for automatic hyphenation from Android. The data is
originated from TeX hyphenation patterns project at http://www.hyphenation.org,
modified by Android engineers. See src/README.android.

Local Modifications:
* Added BUILD.gn.
* The script `build_hyb.sh` was added to generate binary data files
  for the minikin library. Also the `hyb` directory contains the
  binary data files generated by the script.
* The `LICENSE` file was generated by concatenating `NOTICE` or
  `LICENSE` files in each locale directory.
* Removed `src/OWNERS`.

The binary data and `LICENSE` files can be rebuilt by running:
    $ ./build_hyb.sh
from this directory.
