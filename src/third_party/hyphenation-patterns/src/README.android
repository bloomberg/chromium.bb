Description:
Hyphenation patterns for automatic hyphenation from TeX hyphenation patterns
project at http://www.hyphenation.org.

Local Modifications:
The patterns are taken from the hyph-utf8/tex/generic/hyph-utf8/patterns/txt directory.

Only the following patterns are included from that directory:

* Armenian (hy)
* Assamese (as)
* Basque (eu)
* Belarusian (be)
* Bengali (bn)
* Bulgarian (bg)
* Church Slavonic (cu)
* Croation (hr)
* Danish (da)
* Estonian (et)
* Ethiopic script (und-Ethi)
* French (fr)
* German (de)
* Gujarati (gu)
* Hindi (hi)
* Hungarian (hu)
* Irish (ga)
* Kannada (kn)
* Latin (la)
* Malayalam (ml)
* Marathi (mr)
* Mongolian written in Cyrillic (mn-cyrl)
* Norwegian Bokm√•l (nb)
* Norwegian Nynorsk (nn)
* Oriya (or)
* Portuguese (pt)
* Punjabi (pa)
* Sanskrit (sa)
* Slovenian (sl)
* Spanish (es)
* Tamil (ta)
* Telugu (te)
* Turkmen (tk)
* US English (en-US)
* Welsh (cy)

The Ethiopic script pattern files have been renamed from mul-ethi to und-ethi,
to properly follow BCP 47 naming.

In case hyphenation patterns are licensed under dual licenses,
hyph-{lang}.lic.txt files are edited to keep only the license Android applies
as listed in the corresponding NOTICE files.

For the German (de) patterns, the *.chr.txt has been automatically generated
based on the contents of the pattern files, using the the create_chr.py script
created by Android engineers.

British English (en-GB) patterns are taken from a different part of the
tex-hyphen repository. Please see the README.android file in the 'en-GB'
directory.

US English (en-US) patterns have been modified to remove patterns added to
the end of the file that had been incorrectly computed based on the TUGboat
hyphenation exception list. To compensate for that, the TUGboat hyphenation
exception list for US English has been downloaded from
<http://mirror.ctan.org/info/digests/tugboat/hyphenex/ushyphex.tex> and
explicitly added to the end of the hyphenation exception file for US
English.
