Description:
This directory includes proguard.jar to allow Chromium to shrink, optimize java
classes for Android, as well as retrace.jar, to allow for deobfuscation of stack
traces.

Proguard is kept at 5.2.1 because all newer versions were found to optimize in a
way that breaks Chrome. Retrace is at 6.0.3 because version 5.2.1 was found to
infinite loop when deobfuscating certainly strings.
