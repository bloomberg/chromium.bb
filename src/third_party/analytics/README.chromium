Description:
This package supports the use of Google Analytics (GA) in Chrome Platform
Applications and Extensions.  

The library is available from GitHub both as closure JS source and as a
"compiled" bundle (traditional JS). The bundle is included here so that
traditional JS apps (non-closure-compiled) can employ the library.

The SHA1 hash for this version of GoogleChrome/chrome-platform-analytics is
472ed678a2322e9a18b10eadb5adba2cde68529a.

Local Modifications:
Added externs.js allowing apps that do use closure compiler to compile code
referencing this library.
