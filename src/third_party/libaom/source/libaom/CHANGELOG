2021-10-13 v3.2.0
  This release includes compression efficiency and perceptual quality
  improvements, speedup and memory optimizations, as well as some new
  features.

  - New Features
    * Introduced speeds 7, 8, and 9 for all intra mode.
    * Introduced speed 10 for real time mode.
    * Introduced an API that allows external partition decisions.
    * SVC: added support for compound prediction.
    * SVC: added support for fixed SVC modes.

  - Compression Efficiency Improvements
    * Intra-mode search improvement.
    * Improved real time (RT) mode BDrate savings by ~5% (RT speed 5)
      and ~12% (RT speed 6). The improvement was measured on the video
      conference set.
    * Improved real time mode for nonrd path (speed 7, 8, 9): BDrate
      gains of ~3-5%.
    * Rate control and RD adjustments based on ML research in VP9.
      Gains of ~0.5-1.0% for HD.

  - Perceptual Quality Improvements
    * Added a new mode --deltaq-mode=3 to improve perceptual quality
      based on a differential contrast model for still images.
    * Added a new mode –deltaq-mode=4 to improve perceptual quality
      based on user rated cq_level data set for still images.
    * Weighting of some intra mode and partition size choices to better
      manage and retain texture.

  - Speedup and Memory Optimizations
    * Further improved 2-pass good quality encoder speed:
      o Speed 2 speedup: 18%
      o Speed 3 speedup: 22%
      o Speed 4 speedup: 37%
      o Speed 5 speedup: 30%
      o Speed 6 speedup: 20%
    * Optimized the real time encoder (measured on the video conference
      set):
      o RT speed 5 speedup: 110%
      o RT speed 6 speedup: 77%

  - Bug Fixes
    * Issue 3069: Fix one-pass mode keyframe placement off-by-one error.
    * Issue 3156: Fix a bug in av1_quantize_lp AVX2 optimization.

2021-05-03 v3.1.0
  This release adds an "all intra" mode to the encoder, which significantly
  speeds up the encoding of AVIF still images at speed 6.

  - Upgrading:
    All intra mode for encoding AVIF still images and AV1 all intra videos:
    AOM_USAGE_ALL_INTRA (2) can be passed as the 'usage' argument to
    aom_codec_enc_config_default().

    New encoder control IDs added:
      - AV1E_SET_ENABLE_DIAGONAL_INTRA: Enable diagonal (D45 to D203) intra
        prediction modes (0: false, 1: true (default)). Also available as
        "enable-diagonal-intra" for the aom_codec_set_option() function.

    New aom_tune_metric enum value: AOM_TUNE_BUTTERAUGLI. The new aomenc option
    --tune=butteraugli was added to optimize the encoder’s perceptual quality by
    optimizing the Butteraugli metric. Install libjxl (JPEG XL) and then pass
    -DCONFIG_TUNE_BUTTERAUGLI=1 to the cmake command to enable it.

    Addition of support for libvmaf 2.x.
