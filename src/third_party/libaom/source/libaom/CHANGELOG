2021-06-08 v3.1.1
  This release includes several bug fixes.

  - Bug fixes:
    Issue 2965: Cherry-picked the following four commits for the
    tune=butteraugli mode.
      1. Add libjxl to pkg_config if enabled:
         https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/136044
      2. Declare set_mb_butteraugli_rdmult_scaling static:
         https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/134506
      3. Add color range detection in tune=butteraugli mode:
         https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/135521
      4. Enable tune=butteraugli in all-intra mode:
         https://aomedia-review.googlesource.com/c/aom/+/136082

    Issue 3021: Fix vmaf model initialization error when not set to
    tune=vmaf

    Issue 3050: Compilation fails with -DCONFIG_TUNE_VMAF=1

    Issue 3054: Consistent crash on near-static screen content, keyframe
    related

2021-05-03 v3.1.0
  This release adds an "all intra" mode to the encoder, which significantly
  speeds up the encoding of AVIF still images at speed 6.

  - Upgrading:
    All intra mode for encoding AVIF still images and AV1 all intra videos:
    AOM_USAGE_ALL_INTRA (2) can be passed as the 'usage' argument to
    aom_codec_enc_config_default().

    New encoder control IDs added:
      - AV1E_SET_ENABLE_DIAGONAL_INTRA: Enable diagonal (D45 to D203) intra
        prediction modes (0: false, 1: true (default)). Also available as
        "enable-diagonal-intra" for the aom_codec_set_option() function.

    New aom_tune_metric enum value: AOM_TUNE_BUTTERAUGLI. The new aomenc option
    --tune=butteraugli was added to optimize the encoder’s perceptual quality by
    optimizing the Butteraugli metric. Install libjxl (JPEG XL) and then pass
    -DCONFIG_TUNE_BUTTERAUGLI=1 to the cmake command to enable it.

    Addition of support for libvmaf 2.x.

  - Enhancements:
    Heap memory consumption for encoding AVIF still images is significantly
    reduced.

  - Bug fixes:
    Issue 2601: third_party/libaom fails licensecheck

    Issue 2950: Conditional expression for rc->this_key_frame_forced is always
    true in find_next_key_frame()

    Issue 2988: "make install" installs the aom.h header twice

    Issue 2992: Incorrectly printing the temporal_id twice in dump_obu tool

    Issue 2998:

    Issue 2999:

    Issue 3000:

    New key & value API added, available with aom_codec_set_option() function.

    Scaling API expanded to include 1/4, 3/4 and 1/8.
