// This is a single-thread write interface that allows to write protobufs
// directly into the tracing shared buffer without making any copies.
// It takes care of acquiring and releasing chunks from the
// SharedMemoryArbiter and splitting protos over chunks.
// The idea is that each data source creates one (or more) TraceWriter for each
// thread it wants to write from. Each TraceWriter will get its own dedicated
// chunk and will write into the shared buffer without any locking most of the
// time. Locking will happen only when a chunk is exhausted and a new one is
// acquired from the arbiter.

// TODO: TraceWriter needs to keep the shared memory buffer alive (refcount?).
// Otherwise if the shared memory buffer goes away (e.g. the Service crashes)
// the TraceWriter will keep writing into unmapped memory.

  // be used after either: (i) the TraceWriter instance is destroyed, (ii) a
  // subsequence NewTracePacket() call is made on the same TraceWriter instance.
  // The returned packet handle is always valid, but note that, when using
  // BufferExhaustedPolicy::kDrop and the SMB is exhausted, it may be assigned
