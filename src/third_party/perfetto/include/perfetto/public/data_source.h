      // - Beyond those two integers, we access only the TraceWriter here. The
      //   TraceWriter is always safe because it lives on the TLS.
      // - |instance_state| is backed by static storage, so the pointer is
      //   always valid, even after the data source instance is destroyed.
      // - In the case of a race-on-destruction, we'll still see the latest

      //   into the tracing shared memory buffer after stopped. But this isn't
      //   really any worse than the case of the stop IPC being delayed by the
      //   kernel scheduler. The tracing service is robust against data commit
      //   attemps made after tracing is stopped.
