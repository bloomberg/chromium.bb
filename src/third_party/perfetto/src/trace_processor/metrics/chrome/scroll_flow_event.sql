-- While handling a InputLatency::GestureScrollUpdate event a sequence of Flows
-- define the critical path from Beginning to End. This metric breaks down the
-- flows for the same InputLatency::GestureScrollUpdate event.
--
-- WARNING: This metric should not be used as a source of truth. It is under
--          active development and the values & meaning might change without
--          notice.

-- Provides the scroll_jank table which gives us all the GestureScrollUpdate
-- events we care about and labels them janky or not.
SELECT RUN_METRIC('chrome/scroll_jank.sql');

-- We get all latency_info that have valid trace_ids, And we make a synthetic
-- one for the beginning of each GestureScrollUpdate event so we can track the
-- time between receiving the input and being converted into a scroll.
--
-- flows with a trace_id of -1 are incomplete and are difficult to reason about
-- (especially if GestureScrollUpdate flows end up getting -1). so ignore them
-- for this table.

-- This is a heuristic to figure out which flow event properly joins this

--
-- We select the first |ts| from a flow event after its corresponding
-- GestureScrollUpdate has ended. This allows us to use this |ts| to contain all
-- flow events from the start of a particular scroll_slice_id (the slice id of
-- the async event) to that |ts|.
--
-- The reason for this is if these flow events share the same trace_id which can
-- occur if multiple chrome browsers are in the trace (webview & chrome for
-- example). We would normally add flow events from different scrolls, but by
-- limiting by the GestureScrollUpdate end we can prevent incorrect duplication.
-- This breaks of course if the same trace_id happens at the exact same time in
-- both browsers but this is hopefully unlikely.
