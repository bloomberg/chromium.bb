-- The HWC execution time will be calculated based on the runtime of
-- HwcPresentOrValidateDisplay, HwcValidateDisplay, and/or HwcPresentDisplay
-- which are happened in the same onMessageRefresh.
-- There are 3 possible combinations how those functions will be called in
-- a single onMessageRefresh, i.e.:
-- 1. HwcPresentOrValidateDisplay and then HwcPresentDisplay
-- 2. HwcPresentOrValidateDisplay
-- 3. HwcValidateDisplay and then HwcPresentDisplay
