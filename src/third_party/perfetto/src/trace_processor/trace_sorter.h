// This class takes care of sorting events parsed from the trace stream in
// arbitrary order and pushing them to the next pipeline stages (parsing) in
// order. In order to support streaming use-cases, sorting happens within a
// max window. Events are held in the TraceSorter staging area (events_) until
// either (1) the (max - min) timestamp > window_size; (2) trace EOF.
//
// Performance considerations:
// This class is designed assuming that events are mostly ordered and lack of
// ordering tends to happen towards the end of |events_|. In practice, in fact,
// lack of ordering comes from the fact that the ftrace buffers from differnt
// CPUs are independent and are flushed into the trace in blocks. So, when
// taking a trace file, events that are near (w.r.t. file offset) are likely to
// be out-of-order, but events that are ~10MB+ apart from each other are often
// in-order.
//
// Operation:
// When a bunch of events is pushed they are just appeneded to the end of the
// |events_| staging area. While appending, we keep track of the fact that the
// staging area is ordered or not. When an out-of-order event is detected we
// keep track of: (1) the offset within the staging area where the chaos begun,
// (2) the timestamp that broke the ordering.
// When we decide to flush events from the staging area into the next stages of
// the trace processor, we re-sort the events in the staging area. Rather than
// re-sorting everything all the times, we use the above knowledge to restrict
// sorting to the (hopefully smaller) tail of the |events_| staging area.
// At any time, the first partition of |events_| [0 .. sort_start_idx_) is
// ordered, and the second partition [sort_start_idx_.. end] is not.
// We use a logarithmic bound search operation to figure out what is the index
// within the first partition where sorting should start, and sort all events
// from there to the end.
