Note that the actual scripts are generated from xdg-*.in,
xdg-utils-common.in and desc/xdg-*.xml which contains the
command line descriptions. These are the files that you
want to edit.  To add a new script, you must also provide 
a desc/xdg-*.xml file.

DO NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THE GENERATED SCRIPTS THEMSELVES!

Use 'make scripts-clean' to delete all generated files and use
'make scripts' to re-generate them.

The manual files in man/ and html/ are also generated from the
desc/xdg-*.xml files.

Use 'make scripts html man' to update all generated files

Use 'make release' to remove everything but the generated files.
