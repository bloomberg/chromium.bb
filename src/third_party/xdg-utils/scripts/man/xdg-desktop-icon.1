.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The xdg\-desktop\-icon program can be used to install an application launcher or other file on the desktop of the current user\&.
.PP
An application launcher is represented by a *\&.desktop file\&. Desktop files are defined by the freedesktop\&.org Desktop Entry Specification\&. The most important aspects of *\&.desktop files are summarized below\&.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.PP
install
.RS 4
Installs
\fIFILE\fR
to the desktop of the current user\&.
\fIFILE\fR
can be a *\&.desktop file or any other type of file\&.
.RE
.PP
uninstall
.RS 4
Removes
\fIFILE\fR
from the desktop of the current user\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-novendor\fR
.RS 4
Normally, xdg\-desktop\-icon checks to ensure that a *\&.desktop file to be installed has a vendor prefix\&. This option can be used to disable that check\&.
.sp
A vendor prefix consists of alpha characters ([a\-zA\-Z]) and is terminated with a dash ("\-")\&. Companies and organizations are encouraged to use a word or phrase, preferably the organizations name, for which they hold a trademark as their vendor prefix\&. The purpose of the vendor prefix is to prevent name conflicts\&.

.RE
.SH "DESKTOP FILES"
.PP
An application launcher can be added to the desktop by installing a *\&.desktop file\&. A *\&.desktop file consists of a
\fI[Desktop Entry]\fR
header followed by several
\fIKey\fR=\fIValue\fR
lines\&.
.PP
A *\&.desktop file can provide a name and description for an application in several different languages\&. This is done by adding a language code as used by LC_MESSAGES in square brackets behind the
\fIKey\fR\&. This way one can specify different values for the same
\fIKey\fR
depending on the currently selected language\&.
.PP
The following keys are often used:
.PP
Value=1\&.0
.RS 4
This is a mandatory field to indicate that the *\&.desktop file follows the 1\&.0 version of the specification\&.
.RE
.PP
Type=Application
.RS 4
This is a mandatory field that indicates that the *\&.desktop file describes an application launcher\&.
.RE
.PP
Name=\fIApplication Name\fR
.RS 4
The name of the application\&. For example
\fIMozilla\fR
.RE
.PP
GenericName=\fIGeneric Name\fR
.RS 4
A generic description of the application\&. For example
\fIWeb Browser\fR
.RE
.PP
Comment=\fIComment\fR
.RS 4
Optional field to specify a tooltip for the application\&. For example
\fIVisit websites on the Internet\fR
.RE
.PP
Icon=\fIIcon File\fR
.RS 4
The icon to use for the application\&. This can either be an absolute path to an image file or an icon\-name\&. If an icon\-name is provided an image lookup by name is done in the user\*(Aqs current icon theme\&. The
\fBxdg\-icon\-resource\fR
command can be used to install image files into icon themes\&. The advantage of using an icon\-name instead of an absolute path is that with an icon\-name the application icon can be provided in several different sizes as well as in several differently themed styles\&.
.RE
.PP
Exec=\fICommand Line\fR
.RS 4
The command line to start the application\&. If the application can open files the %f placeholder should be specified\&. When a file is dropped on the application launcher the %f is replaced with the file path of the dropped file\&. If multiple files can be specified on the command line the %F placeholder should be used instead of %f\&. If the application is able to open URLs in addition to local files then %u or %U can be used instead of %f or %F\&.

.PP

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
xdg\-desktop\-icon honours the following environment variables:
.PP
XDG_UTILS_DEBUG_LEVEL
.RS 4
Setting this environment variable to a non\-zero numerical value makes xdg\-desktop\-icon do more verbose reporting on stderr\&. Setting a higher value increases the verbosity\&.
.RE
.SH "EXIT CODES"
.PP
An exit code of 0 indicates success while a non\-zero exit code indicates failure\&. The following failure codes can be returned:
.PP
\fB1\fR
.RS 4
Error in command line syntax\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB2\fR
.RS 4
One of the files passed on the command line did not exist\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB3\fR
.RS 4
A required tool could not be found\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB4\fR
.RS 4
The action failed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB5\fR
.RS 4
No permission to read one of the files passed on the command line\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
The company ShinyThings Inc\&. has developed an application named "WebMirror" and would like to add a launcher for for on the desktop\&. The company will use "shinythings" as its vendor id\&. In order to add the application to the desktop there needs to be a \&.desktop file for the application:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shinythings\-webmirror\&.desktop:

  [Desktop Entry]
  Encoding=UTF\-8
  Type=Application

  Exec=webmirror
  Icon=shinythings\-webmirror

  Name=WebMirror
  Name[nl]=WebSpiegel
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Now the xdg\-desktop\-icon tool can be used to add the webmirror\&.desktop file to the desktop:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
xdg\-desktop\-icon install \&./shinythings\-webmirror\&.desktop
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To add a README file to the desktop as well, the following command can be used:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
xdg\-desktop\-icon install \&./shinythings\-README
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
