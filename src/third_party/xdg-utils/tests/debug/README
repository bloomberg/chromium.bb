The "tests" in this directory are here to verify the functionality of the test suite itself. Likely these tests are not useful to a general audience.

You should probably not do anything with them unless you have a good idea what they do.

Questions should be addressed to the test developer: Tom Whipple <mail@tomwhipple.com>
