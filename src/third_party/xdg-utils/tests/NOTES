Test notes for xdg-desktop-icon
-------------------------------
1. Double install behavior is not well defined. Should installing two files with the same name onto the desktop generate errors, or should the older be overwritten?


Test notes for xdg-email
------------------------
1. When running --attach tests, there is a bug in evolution (SUSE 10.0/Gnome) so that the attachment window is not displayed, yet there is still an attachment present. To see it, you must attach a second file.
