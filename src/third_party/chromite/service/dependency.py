def GenerateSourcePathMapping(packages, board):
  """Returns a map from each package to the source paths it depends on.

  A source path is considered dependency of a package if modifying files in that
  path might change the content of the resulting package.

  Notes:
    1) This method errs on the side of returning unneeded dependent paths.
       i.e: for a given package X, some of its dependency source paths may
       contain files which doesn't affect the content of X.

       On the other hands, any missing dependency source paths for package X is
       considered a bug.
    2) This only outputs the direct dependency source paths for a given package
       and does not takes include the dependency source paths of dependency
       packages.
       e.g: if package A depends on B (DEPEND=B), then results of computing
       dependency source paths of A doesn't include dependency source paths
       of B.

  Args:
    packages: The list of packages CPV names (str)
    board (str): The name of the board if packages are dependency of board. If
      the packages are board agnostic, then this should be None.

  Returns:
    Map from each package to the source path (relative to the repo checkout
      root, i.e: ~/trunk/ in your cros_sdk) it depends on.
    For each source path which is a directory, the string is ended with a
      trailing '/'.
