# Chromite Development: Starter Guide

[TOC]

## Objective

This doc tries to give an overview and head start to anyone just starting out on
Chromite development.

## Background

Before you get started on Chromite, we recommend that you go through ChromeOS
developer guides at
[external (first)](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/developer_guide.md)
and then [goto/chromeos-building](http://goto/chromeos-building) for internal.
The
[Gerrit starter guide](https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/android/development/repo-gerrit-git-workflow)
may also be helpful. You should flash a built image on a test device (Ask around
for one!).

Chromite was intended to be the unified codebase for anything related to
building ChromeOS/ChromiumOS. Currently, it is the codebase responsible for
several things including: building the OS from the requisite packages for the
necessary board (`parallel_emerge`), driving the infrastructure build workflow
(CBuildBot), hosting a Google App Engine App, and providing utility functions
for various scripts scattered around ChromeOS repositories. It is written for
the most part in Python with some Bash sprinkled in.

## Directory Overview

You can use [Code Search](https://cs.corp.google.com/) to lookup things in
Chromite or ChromeOS in general. You can add a ChromeOS filter to only show
files from CrOS repositories by going to
[CS Settings](https://cs.corp.google.com/settings/) and adding a new Saved
query: “`package:^chromeos`” named “chromeos”.

### `chromite/api`

The Chromite API for the CI system. The API exposes a subset of the chromite
functionality that needs to be strictly maintained as much as possible.

### `chromite/cbuildbot`

CBuildBot is the collection of entire code that runs on both the parent and the
child build machines. It kicks off the individual stages in a particular build.
It is a configurable bot that builds ChromeOS. More details on CBuildBot can be
found in
[this tech talk](https://drive.google.com/a/google.com/file/d/0BwPS_JpKyELWR2k0Z3JSWUhPSEE/view)
([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nUZFCAADgPp48SmrAFZVV_ngR27BdhKjL32nyu_hbOo/edit#slide=id.i0)).

### `chromite/cbuildbot/builders`

This folder contains configurations of the different builders in use. Each has
its own set of stages to run usually called under RunStages function. Most
builders used regularly are derived from SimpleBuilder class.

### `chromite/cbuildbot/stages`

Each file here has implementations of stages in the build process grouped by
similarity. Each stage usually has PerformStage as its primary function.

### `chromite/docs`

Additional documentation.

### `chromite/lib`

Code here is expected to be imported whenever necessary throughout Chromite.

### `chromite/scripts`

Unlike lib, code in scripts will not and should not be imported anywhere.
Instead they are executed as required in the build process. Each executable is
linked to either `wrapper.py` or `virtualenv_wrapper.py`. Some of these links
are in `chromite/bin`. The wrapper figures out the directory of the executable
script and the `$PYTHONPATH`. Finally, it invokes the correct Python
installation by moving up the directory structure to find which git repo is
making the call.

### `chromite/service`

These files act as the centralized business logic for processes, utilizing lib
for the implementation details. Any process that's implemented in chromite
should generally have an entry point somewhere in a service such that it can be
called from a script, the API, or anywhere else in lib where the process may be
useful.

### `chromite/third_party`

This folder contains all the third_party python libraries required by Chromite.
You need a very strong reason to add any library to the current list. Please
confirm with the owners beforehand.

### `chromite/utils`

This folder contains smaller, generic utility functionality that is not tied to
any specific entities in the codebase that would make them more at home in a lib
module.

### `chromite/infra`

This folder contains the chromite-specific infra repos.

### `chromite/*`

There are smaller folders with miscellaneous functions like config, licencing,
cidb, etc.

## Testing your Chromite changes

Before any testing, you should check your code for lint errors with:

```shell
$ cros lint <filename>
```

### Unit Tests

Every Python file in Chromite is accompanied by a corresponding
`filename_unittest.py` file. More on unit tests here. Once written, the unit
tests can be run using `./run_tests` command in the Chromite directory. To test
a specific file (say `lib/triage_lib.py`), use

```shell
~/trunk/chromite $ ./run_tests lib/triage_lib_unittest
```

Run_tests without any argument runs all unit tests in Chromite. These unit tests
are run in tryjobs, preCQ and CQ as well.

If you have to create a new Python file in Chromite, you should also create a
`{filename}_unittest.py` in the same directory with all the unit tests. Also
make a link called `{filename}_unittest` to
`/mnt/host/source/chromite/scripts/wrapper.py`. See the other unittest files
around if unclear.

### Tryjob

You can also fire a build on a server (or even locally) to have an entire build
happen similar to how it would in Commit Queue.

```shell
$ cros tryjob -g <gerrit-change-id> <trybot-config>
$ cros tryjob -h -> for help on more options
```

Add `--hwtest` to add hardware testing to your tryjob. You can use the link
provided by the command to check the status of your tryjob. Alternatively, you
can go to the
[CI UI tryjobs page](https://cros-goldeneye.corp.google.com/chromeos/legoland/builderSummary?buildConfig&builderGroups=tryjob&email)
and filter results by your email.

### Pre-CQ

Once you mark your CL as Commit-Queue +1 on
[Chromium Gerrit](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com), the PreCQ will pick
up your change and fire few preset config runs as a precursor to CQ. Currently,
it doesn’t include any hardware or VM testing (for now!).

### Commit Queue

This is the final step in getting your change pushed. CQ is the most
comprehensive of all tests. There are a multitude of CL's being validated in the
same CQ. Once a CL is verified by CQ, it is merged into the codebase.
