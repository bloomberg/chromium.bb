AppEngine supports Python 2.5 and 2.7:
  https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/

A utility script dev_appserver is in this directory to automatically
download the sdk and call ./google_appengine/dev_appserver.py with
arguments for serving at <yourhostname>:8080 (which can then be
accessed from other machines on intranet).  See contents of script
for details on what it does (it is very short).

See cq_stats/README to learn about how to work with that zapping good app!
