# This is a simple wrapper around pylint that allows imports to work.
# The import path is unusual because these python files normally run
# as an AppEngine instance, so the import paths are set up to find
# libraries when run there.  They are not set up to find libraries
# rooted at 'chromite'.

# Run in appengine project directory.  Example:
# cd chromiumos-build-stats ; ../ae_pylint main.py
# Or run from this directory.  Example:
# ./ae_pylint cq_stats/main.py
