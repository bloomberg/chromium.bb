"""Provide a class for collecting info on one builder run.

There are two public classes, BuilderRun and ChildBuilderRun, that serve
this function.  The first is for most situations, the second is for "child"
configs within a builder config that has entries in "child_configs".

Almost all functionality is within the common _BuilderRunBase class.  The
only thing the BuilderRun and ChildBuilderRun classes are responsible for
is overriding the self.config value in the _BuilderRunBase object whenever
it is accessed.

It is important to note that for one overall run, there will be one
BuilderRun object and zero or more ChildBuilderRun objects, but they
will all share the same _BuilderRunBase *object*.  This means, for example,
that run attributes (e.g. self.attrs.release_tag) are shared between them
all, as intended.
