  You call CreatePidNs() in pid X
  - X launches Pid Y,
    - Pid X will now do nothing but wait for Pid Y to finish and then sys.exit()
      with that return code
    - Y launches Pid Z

        sys.exit() with that return code
      - **Pid Z returns from CreatePidNs**. So, the caller of this function
        continues in a different process than the one that made the call.
          - All SIGTERM/SIGINT signals are forwarded down from pid X to pid Z to
            handle.
          - SIGKILL will only kill pid X, and leak Pid Y and Z.
