  carrying around dictionary key constants.

  Attributes:
    build_number: The build number of this build, as passed in with
        --buildnumber, or 0 if --buildnumber wasn't passed.
    buildbucket_id: The buildbucket id of this build, as passed in with
        --buildbucket-id, or 0 if --buildbucket-id wasn't passed.
    master_build_id: The CIDB id of the associated master build if there is one,
        or 0 if there isn't one.
    status: One of the status constants from
        chromite.lib.constants.BUILDER_ALL_STATUSES
    buildroot_layout: Version of the buildroot layout.
    branch: Name of the branch this repository is associated with.

        cache was cleaned.
