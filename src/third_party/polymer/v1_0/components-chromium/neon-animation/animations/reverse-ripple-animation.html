`<reverse-ripple-animation>` scales and transform an element such that it appears to ripple down from this element, to either
a shared element, or a screen position.

If using as a shared element animation in `<neon-animated-pages>`, use this animation in an `exit`
animation in the source page and in an `entry` animation in the destination page. Also, define the
reverse-ripple elements in the `sharedElements` property (not a configuration property, see
`Polymer.NeonSharedElementAnimatableBehavior`).
If using a screen position, define the `gesture` property.
Configuration:
```
{
  name: 'reverse-ripple-animation`.
  id: <shared-element-id>, /* set this or gesture */
  gesture: {x: <page-x>, y: <page-y>}, /* set this or id */
  timing: <animation-timing>,
  toPage: <node>, /* define for the destination page */
  fromPage: <node>, /* define for the source page */
}
```
