Description:
Android App Bundle support requires more recent versions of the
'bundletool' and 'aapt2' build tools than those provided with the
copies of the Android SDK currently used by internal or public
Chrome source checkouts.

This directory contains their binaries, distributed through DEPS
as two CIPD packages. See bundletool/cipd.yaml and aapt2/cipd.yaml
for more details.
