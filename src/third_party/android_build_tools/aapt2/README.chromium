Description:
The Linux host aapt2 tool is now released on Google Maven, however as a .jar
file that contains host-specific binaries, which must be extracted. They are
distributed here as a CIPD package instead.

How To Update:
 1. Go to maven.google.com and search for "aapt2" to find the
    "com.android.tools.build > aapt2" package.
 2. Find the latest version you would like to update to.
 3. Replace the version in 3pp/fetch.py with the new version.
 4. Land the a CL with the changes in step 3 and wait for a new instance to be
    uploaded.
    * These instances are uploaded by the build bot:
      https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/builders/ci/3pp-linux-amd64-packager
    * The bot autoruns every 6 hours. Ping a trooper or a clank build core dev
      to trigger it if you need it sooner:
      https://luci-scheduler.appspot.com/jobs/chromium/3pp-linux-amd64-packager
 5. Copy this instance ID to the third_party/android_build_tools/aapt2 entry in
    //DEPS.
 6. Update this file with the new version string for that instance and submit.
    * We mostly care about the string after @.
