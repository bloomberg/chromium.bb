Description:
The Chrome build process uses ART host binaries to perform DEX file
layout. These are not shipped as part of any SDK and so are built manually
from the ART source tree and included here. The URL line above gives the
repo command necessary to download the source tree. The branch and revision
used to build the tools is given in the revision hash (goog/master is the
standard tip-of-tree branch you get using the given repo command). See
https://sites.google.com/a/google.com/dalvik/getting-started-on-dalvik/getting-source
for more information.

The tool source is located in the art/ project, eg
art/dexlayout and art/profman and the binaries are copied from the build
directory out/host/linux-x86/bin/.  The lib/ directory is copied from the
build directory out/host/linux-x86/lib64/
