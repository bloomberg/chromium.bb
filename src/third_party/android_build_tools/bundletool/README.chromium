What version is this:
  * bundletool is now autorolled.
  * To lookup the latest version being used currently:
    * Look up the cipd instance id from //DEPS, or run
      `gclient getdep -r src/third_party/android_build_tools/bundletool:chromium/third_party/android_build_tools/bundletool`.
    * Find the version tag at this url
      https://chrome-infra-packages.appspot.com/p/chromium/third_party/android_build_tools/bundletool/+/<instance id>
    * Or, run `cipd describe chromium/third_party/android_build_tools/bundletool -version <instance id>` and look at the version tag.
    * The version string appears after the @ symbol in the tag.
  * New instances are uploaded by the packager bot:
    https://ci.chromium.org/p/chromium/builders/ci/3pp-linux-amd64-packager
  * The bot autoruns every 6 hours. Ping a trooper or a clank build core dev to
    trigger it if you need it sooner:
    https://luci-scheduler.appspot.com/jobs/chromium/3pp-linux-amd64-packager
  * The autoroller runs automatically when a new cipd instance is uploaded, see
    its status here: https://autoroll.skia.org/r/bundletool-chromium
