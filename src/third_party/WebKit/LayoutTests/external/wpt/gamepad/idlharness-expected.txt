PASS GamepadEvent interface: attribute gamepad
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for gamepad property on GamepadEvent
PASS GamepadEvent must be primary interface of [object GamepadEvent]
PASS Stringification of [object GamepadEvent]
PASS GamepadEvent interface: [object GamepadEvent] must inherit property "gamepad" with the proper type
PASS Navigator interface: operation getGamepads()
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for getGamepads() on Navigator
PASS Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "getGamepads()" with the proper type
