This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Calling replaceTrack on closed connection should reject with InvalidStateError promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental.
