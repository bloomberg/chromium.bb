This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setLocalDescription(offer) with m= section should assign mid to corresponding transceiver Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setRemoteDescription(offer) with m= section and no existing transceiver should create corresponding transceiver Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) should unset transceiver.mid Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) should only unset transceiver mids associated with current round Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setRemoteDescription(rollback) should remove newly created transceiver from transceiver list Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
Harness: the test ran to completion.
