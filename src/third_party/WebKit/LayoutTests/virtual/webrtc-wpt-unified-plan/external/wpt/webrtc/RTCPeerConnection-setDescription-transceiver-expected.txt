This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS setLocalDescription(offer) with m= section should assign mid to corresponding transceiver
PASS setRemoteDescription(offer) with m= section and no existing transceiver should create corresponding transceiver
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) should unset transceiver.mid promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The provided value 'rollback' is not a valid enum value of type RTCSdpType."
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) should only unset transceiver mids associated with current round promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The provided value 'rollback' is not a valid enum value of type RTCSdpType."
FAIL setRemoteDescription(rollback) should remove newly created transceiver from transceiver list promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The provided value 'rollback' is not a valid enum value of type RTCSdpType."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
