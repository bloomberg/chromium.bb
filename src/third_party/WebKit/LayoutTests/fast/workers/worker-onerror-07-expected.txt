Handling an error in the worker should suppress the page-level onerror handler.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".



Worker-level onerror handler triggered:
PASS errorEvent.message is "Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined"
PASS stripURL(errorEvent.filename) is "[blob: URL]"
PASS errorEvent.lineno is 14
PASS errorEvent.colno is 9
PASS errorEvent.error is null
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
