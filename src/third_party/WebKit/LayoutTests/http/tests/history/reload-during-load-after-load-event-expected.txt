This tests starting a new resource load after the load event has finished, then reloading while that load is still in progress. Due to a regression in https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/8b913deb7165a50daa13e6b64300e550cf62a47e, we would overwrite the load type such that the reload will still be executed correctly, but the history entry will be created as though it was a standard load.
