CONSOLE ERROR: line 4: The XSS Auditor refused to execute a script in 'http://localhost:8000/security/xssAuditor/resources/echo-intertag.pl?q=%3Cscript%3E/**/0,0/*,*/-alert(0)%3C/script%3E' because its source code was found within the request. The server sent an 'X-XSS-Protection' header requesting this behavior.

Test that the XSSAuditor's tolerance for the IIS webserver's comma concatenation doesn't open holes when the reflected argument contains an actual comma. The test passes if the XSSAuditor logs console messages and no alerts fire.
