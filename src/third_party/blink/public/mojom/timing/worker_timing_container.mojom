// Used to implement FetchEvent WorkerTiming (https://crbug.com/900700).
// A service worker uses this interface to send performance timings to a client
// (a document/worker controlled by the service worker) during the fetch event
// for a request. The client then incorporates the timings into the
// blink::PerformanceResourceTiming for the request. The client may be in a
// different renderer process than the service worker.
