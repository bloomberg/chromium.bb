// be invoked from the browser process (e.g. content::RenderFrameHostImpl).

// Note that this is different than content/common/frame.mojom in that the
// methods defined here are handled directly in Blink without passing through
// content. In the future this interface will likely host more methods as the
// Onion Soup project advances, which can potentially leading to the removal of
// content/common/frame.mojom in the future if enough code is moved to Blink.
