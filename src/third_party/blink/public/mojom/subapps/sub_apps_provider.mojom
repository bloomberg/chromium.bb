// Sub Apps APIs allow installed PWAs to install shortcuts to their various

// at https://office.org/ which provides a full set of office productivity tools
// creates a new shortcut to itself with `spreadsheet` as the install_path
// effectively adding the Spreadsheet app to the launcher surface.
// NOTE: This Mojo interface is per-frame, there is one logical instance per
// frame, and it's main-frame only. It is only valid for already-installed apps,
// and has an origin associated with it.

  // limiting the API to same-origin apps).
