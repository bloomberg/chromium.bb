// only.
// Sub Apps APIs allow installed PWAs to install shortcuts to their various
// sub-parts by means of installing the sub-component.  Example: main app hosted
// at https://office.org/ which provides a full set of office productivity tools
// creates a new shortcut to itself with https://office.org/spreadsheet as the
// install_url effectively adding the Spreadsheet app to the launcher surface.
