Tests using a destroyed query set on a queue.

- used in {resolveQuerySet, timestamp {compute, render, non-pass},
    pipeline statistics {compute, render}, occlusion}
- x= {destroyed, not destroyed (control case)}

TODO: implement. (Search for other places some of these cases may have already been tested.)
Consider whether these tests should be distributed throughout the suite, instead of centralized.
