This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL TransformStream flush is called immediately when the writable is closed, if no writes are queued Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
FAIL TransformStream flush is called after all queued writes finish, once the writable is closed Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
FAIL TransformStream flush gets a chance to enqueue more into the readable Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
FAIL TransformStream flush gets a chance to enqueue more into the readable, and can then async close Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
FAIL error() during flush should cause writer.close() to reject Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
Harness: the test ran to completion.
