This is a testharness.js-based test.
Harness Error. harness_status.status = 1 , harness_status.message = Failed to execute 'pipeTo' on 'ReadableStream': pipeTo disabled because StreamsNative feature is enabled
FAIL controller.terminate() should error pipeTo() assert_false: pipeTo() should not have rejected yet expected false got true
FAIL controller.terminate() should prevent remaining chunks from being processed assert_array_equals: transform() should have seen one chunk lengths differ, expected 2 got 0
PASS controller.enqueue() should throw after controller.terminate()
PASS controller.error() after controller.terminate() with queued chunk should error the readable
PASS controller.error() after controller.terminate() without queued chunk should do nothing
