This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setLocalDescription(offer) with m= section should assign mid to corresponding transceiver Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'.
FAIL setRemoteDescription(offer) with m= section and no existing transceiver should create corresponding transceiver Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'.
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) should unset transceiver.mid Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'.
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) should only unset transceiver mids associated with current round Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'.
FAIL setRemoteDescription(rollback) should remove newly created transceiver from transceiver list Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'.
FAIL setRemoteDescription should stop the transceiver if its corresponding m section is rejected promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
