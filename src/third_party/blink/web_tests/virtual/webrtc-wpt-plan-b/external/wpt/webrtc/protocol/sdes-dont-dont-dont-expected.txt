This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL does not create offers with SDES promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
PASS rejects a remote offer that only includes SDES and no DTLS fingerprint
Harness: the test ran to completion.
