This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setRemoteDescription(rollback) in have-remote-offer state should revert to stable state promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Rollback not supported in Plan B"
FAIL setRemoteDescription(rollback) from stable state should reject with InvalidStateError promise_rejects_dom: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Rollback not supported in Plan B" that is not a DOMException InvalidStateError: property "code" is equal to 0, expected 11
FAIL setRemoteDescription(rollback) should ignore invalid sdp content and succeed promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Rollback not supported in Plan B"

FAIL rollback of a remote offer should keep a transceiver created by addtrack assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
FAIL rollback of a remote offer should keep a transceiver without tracks assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
FAIL explicit rollback of local offer should remove transceivers and transport promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Cannot read property 'sender' of undefined"
FAIL when using addTransceiver, implicit rollback of a local offer should visit stable state, but not fire negotiationneeded until we settle in stable promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL when using addTrack, implicit rollback of a local offer should visit stable state, but not fire negotiationneeded promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Failed to set remote offer sdp: Called in wrong state: kHaveLocalOffer"
FAIL rollback of a remote offer to negotiated stable state should enable applying of a local offer promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Rollback not supported in Plan B"

FAIL onremovetrack fires during remote rollback promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Rollback not supported in Plan B"
FAIL rollback of a remote offer with stream changes promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Cannot read property 'sender' of undefined"
FAIL removeTrack() with a sender being rolled back does not crash or throw promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL Implicit rollback with only a datachannel works promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
