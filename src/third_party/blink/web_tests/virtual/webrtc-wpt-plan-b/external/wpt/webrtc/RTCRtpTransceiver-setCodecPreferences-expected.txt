This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setCodecPreferences() on audio transceiver with codecs returned from RTCRtpSender.getCapabilities('audio') should succeed Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setCodecPreferences() on video transceiver with codecs returned from RTCRtpReceiver.getCapabilities('video') should succeed Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with both sender receiver codecs combined should succeed Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setCodecPreferences([]) should succeed Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with reordered codecs should succeed Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setCodecPreferences() on audio transceiver with codecs returned from getCapabilities('video') should throw InvalidAccessError Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with user defined codec should throw InvalidAccessError Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with user defined codec together with codecs returned from getCapabilities() should throw InvalidAccessError Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with modified codecs returned from getCapabilities() should throw InvalidAccessError Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
