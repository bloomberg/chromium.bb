This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS setLocalDescription() with valid answer should succeed
PASS setLocalDescription() with type answer and null sdp should use lastAnswer generated from createAnswer
PASS setLocalDescription() with answer not created by own createAnswer() should reject with InvalidModificationError
FAIL Calling setLocalDescription(answer) from stable state should reject with InvalidModificationError promise_rejects_dom: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Failed to set local answer sdp: Called in wrong state: kStable" that is not a DOMException InvalidModificationError: property "code" is equal to 0, expected 13
FAIL Calling setLocalDescription(answer) from have-local-offer state should reject with InvalidModificationError promise_rejects_dom: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Failed to set local answer sdp: Called in wrong state: kHaveLocalOffer" that is not a DOMException InvalidModificationError: property "code" is equal to 0, expected 13
FAIL Setting previously generated answer after a call to createOffer should work promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Rollback not supported in Plan B"
FAIL setLocalDescription(answer) should update internal state with a queued task, in the right order assert_not_equals: pendingRemoteDescription should not be set synchronously after a call to sLD got disallowed value null
Harness: the test ran to completion.
