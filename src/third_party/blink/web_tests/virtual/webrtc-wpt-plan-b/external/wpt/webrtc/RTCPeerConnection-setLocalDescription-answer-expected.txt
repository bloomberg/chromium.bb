This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS setLocalDescription() with valid answer should succeed
PASS setLocalDescription() with type answer and null sdp should use lastAnswer generated from createAnswer
PASS setLocalDescription() with answer not created by own createAnswer() should reject with InvalidModificationError
FAIL Calling setLocalDescription(answer) from stable state should reject with InvalidModificationError assert_throws: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Failed to set local answer sdp: Called in wrong state: kStable" that is not a DOMException InvalidModificationError: property "code" is equal to 0, expected 13
FAIL Calling setLocalDescription(answer) from have-local-offer state should reject with InvalidModificationError assert_throws: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Failed to set local answer sdp: Called in wrong state: kHaveLocalOffer" that is not a DOMException InvalidModificationError: property "code" is equal to 0, expected 13
FAIL Setting previously generated answer after a call to createOffer should work promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Rollback not supported in Plan B"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
