This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Initial iceConnectionState should be new
PASS Closing the connection should set iceConnectionState to closed
PASS connection with one data channel should eventually have connected or completed connection state
FAIL connection with one data channel should eventually have connected connection state Cannot read property 'transport' of null
PASS connection with audio track should eventually have connected connection state
PASS connection with audio and video tracks should eventually have connected connection state
FAIL ICE can connect in a recvonly usecase promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
