This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Initial iceGatheringState should be new
PASS iceGatheringState should eventually become complete after setLocalDescription
PASS setLocalDescription(reoffer) with no new transports should not cause iceGatheringState to change
FAIL rolling back an ICE restart when gathering is complete should not result in iceGatheringState changes promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Rollback not supported in Plan B"
PASS setLocalDescription(reoffer) with a new transport should cause iceGatheringState to go to "checking" and then "complete"
FAIL sRD does not cause ICE gathering state changes promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Rollback not supported in Plan B"
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) of original offer should cause iceGatheringState to reach "new" when starting in "complete" promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Rollback not supported in Plan B"
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) of original offer should cause iceGatheringState to reach "new" when starting in "gathering" promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: Failed to execute 'setLocalDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Rollback not supported in Plan B"
FAIL renegotiation that closes all transports should result in ICE gathering state "new" promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Cannot read property 'stop' of undefined"
FAIL connection with one data channel should eventually have connected connection state Cannot read property 'transport' of null
Harness: the test ran to completion.
