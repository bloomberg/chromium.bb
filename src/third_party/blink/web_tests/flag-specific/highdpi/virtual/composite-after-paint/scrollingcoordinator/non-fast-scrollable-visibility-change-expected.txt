This should be covered by a green overlay.

Two squares should be visible and fully covered by green overlays.

This test ensures that changing visibility of a non-fast scrollable area correctly updates list of non-fast scrollable areas (See http://crbug.com/434982). Two types of non-fast scrollable regions are covered: div, and iframe.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
