This test checks if contextmenu event target is correct when handled at the document level and in the presence of pinch-zoom. To test manually, first pinch-zoom into the page, scroll away from the origin and then then press the menu key. There are three cases to check: nothing focused (the context menu is expected to appear in the top left of the viewport), click on the orange box to focus it then use the menu key, and select some text in the box and use the menu key. Note: on Mac there is no menu key.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
