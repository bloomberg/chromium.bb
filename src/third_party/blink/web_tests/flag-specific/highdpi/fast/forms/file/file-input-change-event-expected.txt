On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".

PASS singleFileInput.value is "C:\\fakepath\\bar.txt"
PASS changeDispatched is true
PASS singleFileInput.value is "C:\\fakepath\\bar.txt"
PASS changeDispatched is false
PASS singleFileInput.value is "C:\\fakepath\\foo.txt"
PASS changeDispatched is true
PASS singleFileInput.value is "C:\\fakepath\\baz.png"
PASS changeDispatched is true
