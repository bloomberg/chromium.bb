<p>Test passes if there is a filled green square and <strong>no red</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that this test will only pass if we stitch together composited fragments
  (i.e. pre-CompositeAfterPaint). Once we handle fragmentation correctly for
  composited objects, this test is invalid, and should be deleted.</p>
