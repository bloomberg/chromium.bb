<div style="columns:6; column-gap:2px; column-rule:2px solid; width:250px; font:20px/14px Ahem; orphans:1; widows:1;">
    <!-- We set a 20px tall font and a line height of 14px, so that text will overflow their line
         boxes. We thus get 6px of overflow, and the text will overflow the line equally above and
         below the line box, so that we have 3px on each side. The 3px of overflow below the lines
         needs to be counted as space shortage by the column balancer, or it will erroneously
         stretch the columns so much that two lines of text will fit in each column, leaving empty
         columns at the end. Which would be silly, given that we have 6 lines of equal height and 6
         columns. -->
