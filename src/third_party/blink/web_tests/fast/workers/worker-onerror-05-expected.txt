This tests that exceptions trigger a worker's onerror in addition to the page-level 'worker.onerror'.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Worker-level onerror handler triggered:
PASS errorEvent.message is "Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined"
PASS stripURL(errorEvent.filename) is "[blob: URL]"
PASS errorEvent.lineno is 12
PASS errorEvent.colno is 9

Page-level worker.onerror handler triggered:
PASS errorEvent.message is "Uncaught ReferenceError: foo is not defined"
PASS stripURL(errorEvent.filename) is "[blob: URL]"
PASS errorEvent.lineno is 12
PASS errorEvent.colno is 9
PASS errorEvent.error is null
