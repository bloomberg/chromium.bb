This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Do not crash when exceptions are thrown during keyframe iteration. assert_throws: function "() => {
    target.animate({
      [Symbol.iterator]() {
        return { next() { throw 'error'; } };
      }
    });
  }" threw "error" with type "string", not an object
Harness: the test ran to completion.
