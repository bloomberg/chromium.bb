CONSOLE ERROR: Refused to load the script 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/htmlimports/resources/external-script.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src http://localhost:8000". Note that 'script-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.

CONSOLE ERROR: line 2: Uncaught EvalError: Refused to evaluate a string as JavaScript because 'unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of script in the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src http://localhost:8000".

CONSOLE ERROR: line 6: Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src http://localhost:8000". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-wnLyUqsXhUuQ5NVNJO+JjNabqB1yo9OPLLJWPopauN0='), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution.
