CONSOLE WARNING: line 3: Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.
Test that a subframe without manifest doesn't pick an application cache from parent frame (as long as no relevant cache contains its resource).

Techically, the check is that iframe subresources that are not in top frame cache are loaded anyway, so it can also pass if the UA fails to reject loads for cache misses.

Should say SUCCESS:

SUCCESS
