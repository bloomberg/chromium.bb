CONSOLE ERROR: The 'allow' directive has been replaced with 'default-src'. Please use that directive instead, as 'allow' has no effect.
CONSOLE ERROR: Refused to load the script 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/contentSecurityPolicy/resources/script.js' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'none'". Note that 'script-src-elem' was not explicitly set, so 'script-src' is used as a fallback.

This script should not execute even though there are parse errors in the policy.
