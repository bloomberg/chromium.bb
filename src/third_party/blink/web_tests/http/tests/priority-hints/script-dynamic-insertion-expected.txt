This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS high fetchpriority on dynamically-inserted <script>s translates to kHigh resource load priority
PASS low fetchpriority on dynamically-inserted <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS auto fetchpriority on dynamically-inserted <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS invalid fetchpriority on dynamically-inserted <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS missing fetchpriority on dynamically-inserted <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS high fetchpriority on dynamically-inserted module <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
FAIL low fetchpriority on dynamically-inserted module <script>s translates to kLow resource load priority assert_equals: expected 1 but got 3
PASS auto fetchpriority on dynamically-inserted module <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS invalid fetchpriority on dynamically-inserted module <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS missing fetchpriority on dynamically-inserted module <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
Harness: the test ran to completion.
