This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS idl_test setup
PASS idl_test validation
PASS Partial interface Performance: original interface defined
PASS Partial interface Performance: valid exposure set
PASS Partial interface Performance: member names are unique
FAIL Profiler interface: existence and properties of interface object assert_equals: prototype of Profiler is not EventTarget expected function "function EventTarget() { [native code] }" but got function "function () { [native code] }"
PASS Profiler interface object length
PASS Profiler interface object name
FAIL Profiler interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: prototype of Profiler.prototype is not EventTarget.prototype expected object "[object EventTarget]" but got object "[object Object]"
PASS Profiler interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS Profiler interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS Profiler interface: attribute sampleInterval
PASS Profiler interface: attribute stopped
PASS Profiler interface: operation stop()
PASS Profiler must be primary interface of profiler
PASS Stringification of profiler
PASS Profiler interface: profiler must inherit property "sampleInterval" with the proper type
PASS Profiler interface: profiler must inherit property "stopped" with the proper type
PASS Profiler interface: profiler must inherit property "stop()" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: operation profile(ProfilerInitOptions)
PASS Performance interface: performance must inherit property "profile(ProfilerInitOptions)" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: calling profile(ProfilerInitOptions) on performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError
Harness: the test ran to completion.
