This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Property image-rendering value 'auto' computes to 'auto'
FAIL Property image-rendering value 'smooth' computes to 'smooth' assert_true: 'smooth' is a supported value for image-rendering. expected true got false
FAIL Property image-rendering value 'high-quality' computes to 'high-quality' assert_true: 'high-quality' is a supported value for image-rendering. expected true got false
FAIL Property image-rendering value 'crisp-edges' computes to 'crisp-edges' assert_true: 'crisp-edges' is a supported value for image-rendering. expected true got false
PASS Property image-rendering value 'pixelated' computes to 'pixelated'
Harness: the test ran to completion.
