This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Property will-change value 'auto' computes to 'auto'
PASS Property will-change value 'scroll-position' computes to 'scroll-position'
PASS Property will-change value 'contents' computes to 'contents'
PASS Property will-change value 'transform' computes to 'transform'
PASS Property will-change value 'background-color' computes to 'background-color'
FAIL Property will-change value 'scroll-position, contents' computes to 'scroll-position, contents' assert_equals: expected "scroll-position, contents" but got "contents, scroll-position"
PASS Property will-change value 'scroll-position, transform' computes to 'scroll-position, transform'
PASS Property will-change value 'contents, transform' computes to 'contents, transform'
PASS Property will-change value 'transform, background-color' computes to 'transform, background-color'
Harness: the test ran to completion.
