This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Sanity assert_equals: expected "2" but got "auto"
FAIL Basic division works assert_equals: expected "2" but got "auto"
FAIL Rounds up if fractional part is >= 0.5 assert_equals: expected "1" but got "auto"
FAIL Accepts numbers, and rounds assert_equals: expected "1" but got "auto"
FAIL Operation between <integer> and <number> works assert_equals: expected "3" but got "auto"
FAIL Rounds down if fractional part is < 0.5 assert_equals: expected "0" but got "auto"
FAIL Only rounds at the end of the conversion assert_equals: expected "1" but got "auto"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
