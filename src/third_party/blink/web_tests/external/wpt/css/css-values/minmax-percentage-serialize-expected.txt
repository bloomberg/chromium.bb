This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS e.style['margin-left'] = "min(1%)" should set the property value
PASS e.style['margin-left'] = "max(1%)" should set the property value
PASS e.style['margin-left'] = "min(1%, 2%, 3%)" should set the property value
PASS e.style['margin-left'] = "min(3%, 2%, 1%)" should set the property value
PASS e.style['margin-left'] = "max(1%, 2%, 3%)" should set the property value
PASS e.style['margin-left'] = "max(3%, 2%, 1%)" should set the property value
PASS e.style['margin-left'] = "calc(min(1%) + min(2%))" should set the property value
PASS e.style['margin-left'] = "calc(max(1%) + max(2%))" should set the property value
PASS e.style['margin-left'] = "calc(1% + min(1%))" should set the property value
FAIL e.style['margin-left'] = "calc(min(1%) + 1%)" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "calc(1% + min(1%))" but got "calc(min(1%) + 1%)"
PASS e.style['margin-left'] = "calc(1% + max(1%))" should set the property value
FAIL e.style['margin-left'] = "calc(max(1%) + 1%)" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "calc(1% + max(1%))" but got "calc(max(1%) + 1%)"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
