This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS min(1%) should be used-value-equivalent to 1%
PASS max(1%) should be used-value-equivalent to 1%
PASS min(20%, max(10%, 15%)) should be used-value-equivalent to 15%
PASS max(10%, min(20%, 15%)) should be used-value-equivalent to 15%
PASS calc(min(10%, 20%) + 5%) should be used-value-equivalent to 15%
PASS calc(min(10%, 20%) - 5%) should be used-value-equivalent to 5%
PASS calc(min(10%, 20%) * 2) should be used-value-equivalent to 20%
PASS calc(min(10%, 20%) / 2) should be used-value-equivalent to 5%
PASS calc(max(10%, 20%) + 5%) should be used-value-equivalent to 25%
PASS calc(max(10%, 20%) - 5%) should be used-value-equivalent to 15%
PASS calc(max(10%, 20%) * 2) should be used-value-equivalent to 40%
PASS calc(max(10%, 20%) / 2) should be used-value-equivalent to 10%
PASS calc(min(10%, 20%) + max(10%, 5%)) should be used-value-equivalent to 20%
FAIL calc(min(10%, 20%) - max(10%, 5%)) should be used-value-equivalent to 0% assert_not_equals: calc(min(10%, 20%) - max(10%, 5%)) isn't valid in 'margin-left'; got the default value instead. got disallowed value "0px"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
