This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS "rotateY(360deg)" and "rotateX(720deg)" are valid transform values
FAIL Animation between "rotateY(360deg)" and "rotateX(720deg)" at progress 0.5 assert_equals: expected "matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)" but got "matrix3d(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
