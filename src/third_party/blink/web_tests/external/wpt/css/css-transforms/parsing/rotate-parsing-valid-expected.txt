This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS e.style['rotate'] = "none" should set the property value
PASS e.style['rotate'] = "0deg" should set the property value
PASS e.style['rotate'] = "100 200 300 400grad" should set the property value
PASS e.style['rotate'] = "400grad 100 200 300" should set the property value
FAIL e.style['rotate'] = "x 400grad" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "x 400grad" but got "1 0 0 400grad"
FAIL e.style['rotate'] = "400grad x" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "x 400grad" but got "1 0 0 400grad"
FAIL e.style['rotate'] = "1 0 0 400grad" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "x 400grad" but got "1 0 0 400grad"
FAIL e.style['rotate'] = "y 400grad" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "y 400grad" but got "0 1 0 400grad"
FAIL e.style['rotate'] = "400grad y" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "y 400grad" but got "0 1 0 400grad"
FAIL e.style['rotate'] = "0 1 0 400grad" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "y 400grad" but got "0 1 0 400grad"
FAIL e.style['rotate'] = "z 400grad" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "z 400grad" but got "0 0 1 400grad"
FAIL e.style['rotate'] = "400grad z" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "z 400grad" but got "0 0 1 400grad"
FAIL e.style['rotate'] = "0 0 1 400grad" should set the property value assert_equals: serialization should be canonical expected "z 400grad" but got "0 0 1 400grad"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
