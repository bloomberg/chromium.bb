This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL After setting a transition's effect to null, it still reports the original transition property assert_equals: expected (string) "left" but got (undefined) undefined
PASS After setting a transition's effect to null, it becomes finished
PASS After setting a transition's effect to null, style is updated
PASS After setting a new keyframe effect with a shorter duration, the transition becomes finished
FAIL After setting a new keyframe effect targeting different properties, the transition continues to report the original transition property assert_equals: expected (string) "left" but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL After setting a new keyframe effect on a play-pending transition, the transition remains pending assert_true: expected true got undefined
Harness: the test ran to completion.
