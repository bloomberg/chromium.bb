This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Animated style is cleared after canceling a running CSS transition
PASS After canceling a transition, it can still be re-used
PASS After canceling a finished transition, it can still be re-used
PASS After canceling a transition, updating transition properties doesn't make it live again
FAIL Setting display:none on an element cancels its transitions assert_equals: expected "idle" but got "running"
FAIL Setting display:none cancels transitions on a child element assert_equals: expected "idle" but got "running"
PASS Removing a property from transition-property cancels transitions on that property
PASS Setting zero combined duration
PASS Changing style to another interpolable value cancels the original transition
PASS An after-change style value can't be interpolated
PASS Reversing a running transition cancels the original transition
