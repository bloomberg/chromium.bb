This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS delay of a new tranisition
PASS Positive delay of a new transition
PASS Negative delay of a new transition
PASS endDelay of a new transition
PASS fill of a new transition
PASS iterationStart of a new transition
PASS iterations of a new transition
PASS duration of a new transition
PASS direction of a new transition
FAIL easing of a new transition assert_equals: Initial value of easing expected "linear" but got "ease"
PASS endTime of a new transition
PASS activeDuration of a new transition
PASS localTime of a new transition
PASS localTime is always equal to currentTime
PASS localTime reflects playbackRate immediately
PASS progress of a new transition
PASS progress of a new transition with positive delay in before phase
PASS progress of a finished transition
PASS currentIteration of a new transition
PASS currentIteration of a new transition with positive delay in before phase
PASS currentIteration of a finished transition
Harness: the test ran to completion.
