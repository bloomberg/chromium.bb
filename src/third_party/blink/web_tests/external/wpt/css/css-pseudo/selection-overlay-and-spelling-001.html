  <!--

  The initial version of this test was relying on color
  composition and was predicting a lime-green-ish (#7FBF80:
  slightly desaturated lime green) background color for "Txet".

  "#7fbf80 color description : Slightly desaturated lime green"
  https://www.colorhexa.com/7fbf80

  This test does not rely on color composition but the
  test nevertheless verifies the ::selection overlay drawn
  over the ::grammar-error overlay.

  Chromium 83+'s selection highlight will vertically
  extend to line box top and bottom... which is
  under an eventual discussion in
  https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5395
  One easy way to work around this issue
  would be to set 'line-height' to '1' instead of
  '90px'.

  <style>
  div
    {
      font-size: 60px;
      line-height: 1;
      /*
      We deliberately set line-height to 1 in order
      to avoid/work around a possible difference
      of rendering of highlight overlay among browsers.
      In Chrome 80+, the selection highlight
      overlay will extent vertically to include line
      box top and line box bottom. This is not
      the case in Firefox 68+.
      */
    }

  div::selection
    {
      background-color: rgba(0%, 50%, 100%, 0.5);
      /*
      a very lite blue color
      according to
      https://www.colorhexa.com/7fbfff
      */
      color: yellow;
    }

  div::spelling-error
    {
      background-color: yellow;
      color: red;
    }
  </style>

  <script src="support/selections.js"></script>

  <p>PREREQUISITE: User agent needs to have an enabled and capable spelling error module. If it does not, then this test does not apply to such user agent.

  <p>Test passes

  <ul>
    <li>if each glyph of "Txet sample" is yellow
    <li>if "Txet" has a desaturated lime green background
    <li>if " sample" has a very lite blue background and
    <li>if there is no red.
  </ul>

  <!--
    The bad spelling of Txet is intentional and part of this test.

    https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#spelling-and-grammar-checking
    • contenteditable makes the text “checkable for the purposes of [spelling and grammar checking]”
    • spellcheck tries to enable spelling and grammar checking (subject to user preferences)
    • lang tries to guide the UA towards checking the text in English (but the UA may ignore this)
  -->
  <div id="test" contenteditable="true" spellcheck="true" lang="en">Txet sample</div>

  <script>
  const test = document.querySelector("#test");
  selectNodeContents(test);
  trySpellcheck(test);
