This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL attachShadow can take slotAssignment parameter. Failed to execute 'attachShadow' on 'Element': The provided value 'name' is not a valid enum value of type SlotAssignmentMode.
PASS Imperative slot API throws exception when not slotAssignment != 'manual'.
PASS Imperative slot API throws exception when slottable parentNode != slot's host.
PASS Imperative slot API can assign nodes in manual slot assignment.
PASS Order of slottables is preserved in manual slot assignment.
PASS Previously assigned slottable is moved to new slot when it's reassigned.
PASS Order and assignment of nodes are preserved during multiple assignment in a row.
PASS Assigning invalid nodes causes exception and slot returns to its previous state.
PASS Moving a slot to a new host, the slot loses its previously assigned slottables.
PASS Moving a slot's tree order position within a shadow host has no impact on its assigned slottables.
PASS Appending slottable to different host, it loses slot assignment. It can be re-assigned within a new host.
PASS Previously assigned node should not be assigned if slot moved to a new shadow root. The slot remains empty when moved back, no trigger recalc.
PASS Previously assigned node should not be assigned if slot moved to a new shadow root. The slot remains empty when moved back, trigger recalc.
PASS Assignment with the same node in parameters should be ignored, last one wins.
PASS Removing a slot from DOM resets its slottable's slot assignment.
PASS A slot should be cleared of assigned nodes even if it's re-inserted into the same shadow root.
Harness: the test ran to completion.
