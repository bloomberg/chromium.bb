This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Capturing event listeners should be invoked before bubbling event listeners on the target without shadow trees assert_object_equals: property "0" expected ["capturing", 2, "target", "target", ["target", "parent", "test1"]] got ["bubbling", 2, "target", "target", ["target", "parent", "test1"]]
FAIL Capturing event listeners should be invoked before bubbling event listeners when an event is dispatched inside a shadow tree assert_object_equals: property "0" expected ["capturing", 2, "target", "target", ["target", "shadowRoot", "host", "test2"]] got ["bubbling", 2, "target", "target", ["target", "shadowRoot", "host", "test2"]]
FAIL Capturing event listeners should be invoked before bubbling event listeners when an event is dispatched inside a doubly nested shadow tree assert_object_equals: property "0" expected ["capturing", 2, "target", "target", ["target", "innerShadowRoot", "innerHost", "outerShadowRoot", "outerHost", "test3"]] got ["bubbling", 2, "target", "target", ["target", "innerShadowRoot", "innerHost", "outerShadowRoot", "outerHost", "test3"]]
FAIL Capturing event listeners should be invoked before bubbling event listeners when an event is dispatched via a slot assert_object_equals: property "0" expected ["capturing", 2, "target", "target", ["target", "host", "test4"]] got ["bubbling", 2, "target", "target", ["target", "host", "test4"]]
FAIL Capturing event listeners should be invoked before bubbling event listeners when an event is dispatched inside a shadow tree which passes through another shadow tree assert_object_equals: property "0" expected ["capturing", 2, "target", "target", ["target", "lowerShadowRoot", "lowerHost", "upperHost", "test5"]] got ["bubbling", 2, "target", "target", ["target", "lowerShadowRoot", "lowerHost", "upperHost", "test5"]]
Harness: the test ran to completion.
