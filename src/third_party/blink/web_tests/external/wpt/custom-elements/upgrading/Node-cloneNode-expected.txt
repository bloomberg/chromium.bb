This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Node.prototype.cloneNode(false) must be able to clone a custom element
PASS Node.prototype.cloneNode(false) must be able to clone as a autonomous custom element when it contains is attribute
PASS Node.prototype.cloneNode(false) must be able to clone as a customized built-in element when it has an inconsistent "is" attribute
PASS Node.prototype.cloneNode(false) must be able to clone a custom element inside an iframe
PASS Node.prototype.cloneNode(true) must be able to clone a descendent custom element
PASS Node.prototype.cloneNode(true) must set parentNode, previousSibling, and nextSibling before upgrading custom elements
FAIL HTMLElement constructor must throw an TypeError when the top of the construction stack is marked AlreadyConstructed due to a custom element constructor constructing itself after super() call assert_equals: expected "TypeError" but got "InvalidStateError"
FAIL HTMLElement constructor must throw an TypeError when the top of the construction stack is marked AlreadyConstructed due to a custom element constructor constructing itself before super() call assert_equals: expected "TypeError" but got "InvalidStateError"
FAIL Upgrading a custom element must throw TypeError when the custom element's constructor returns another element assert_equals: expected "TypeError" but got "InvalidStateError"
PASS Inserting an element must not try to upgrade a custom element when it had already failed to upgrade once
Harness: the test ran to completion.
