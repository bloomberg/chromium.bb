This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS User succesfully selected an empty directory.
PASS User granted write access.
PASS write() with an empty blob to an empty file
PASS write() a blob to an empty file
PASS write() with WriteParams without position to an empty file
PASS write() a string to an empty file with zero offset
PASS write() a blob to an empty file with zero offset
PASS write() called consecutively appends
PASS write() WriteParams without position and string appends
PASS write() WriteParams without position and blob appends
PASS write() called with a string and a valid offset
PASS write() called with a blob and a valid offset
FAIL write() called with an invalid offset assert_unreached: Should have rejected: undefined Reached unreachable code
PASS write() with an empty string to an empty file
PASS write() with a valid utf-8 string
PASS write() with a string with unix line ending preserved
PASS write() with a string with windows line ending preserved
PASS write() with an empty array buffer to an empty file
PASS write() with a valid typed array buffer
PASS atomic writes: close() fails when parent directory is removed
PASS atomic writes: writable file streams make atomic changes on close
PASS atomic writes: write() after close() fails
PASS atomic writes: truncate() after close() fails
PASS atomic writes: close() after close() fails
PASS atomic writes: only one close() operation may succeed
PASS atomic writes: writable file stream persists file on close, even if file is removed
PASS getWriter() can be used
PASS WriteParams: truncate missing size param
PASS WriteParams: write missing data param
PASS WriteParams: seek missing position param
Harness: the test ran to completion.
