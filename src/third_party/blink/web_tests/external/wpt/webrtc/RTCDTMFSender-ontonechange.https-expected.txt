This is a testharness.js-based test.
Harness Error. harness_status.status = 1 , harness_status.message = Uncaught TypeError: transceiver.stop is not a function
PASS insertDTMF() with default duration and intertoneGap should fire tonechange events at the expected time
PASS insertDTMF() with explicit duration and intertoneGap should fire tonechange events at the expected time
PASS insertDTMF('') should not fire any tonechange event, including for '' tone
PASS insertDTMF() with duration less than 40 should be clamped to 40
PASS insertDTMF() with interToneGap less than 30 should be clamped to 30
PASS insertDTMF with comma should delay next tonechange event for a constant 2000ms
FAIL insertDTMF() with transceiver stopped in the middle should stop future tonechange events from firing assert_greater_than: More tonechange event is fired than expected expected a number greater than 0 but got 0
PASS Calling insertDTMF() in the middle of tonechange events should cause future tonechanges to be updated to new tones
PASS Calling insertDTMF() multiple times in the middle of tonechange events should cause future tonechanges to be updated the last provided tones
PASS Calling insertDTMF('') in the middle of tonechange events should stop future tonechange events from firing
FAIL Setting transceiver.currentDirection to recvonly in the middle of tonechange events should stop future tonechange events from firing Failed to execute 'insertDTMF' on 'RTCDTMFSender': The 'canInsertDTMF' attribute is false: this sender cannot send DTMF.
PASS Tone change event constructor works
PASS Tone change event with unexpected name should not crash
Harness: the test ran to completion.
