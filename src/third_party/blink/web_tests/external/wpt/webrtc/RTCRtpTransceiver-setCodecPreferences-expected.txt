This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setCodecPreferences() on audio transceiver with codecs returned from RTCRtpSender.getCapabilities('audio') should succeed transceiver.setCodecPreferences is not a function
FAIL setCodecPreferences() on video transceiver with codecs returned from RTCRtpReceiver.getCapabilities('video') should succeed transceiver.setCodecPreferences is not a function
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with both sender receiver codecs combined should succeed transceiver.setCodecPreferences is not a function
FAIL setCodecPreferences([]) should succeed transceiver.setCodecPreferences is not a function
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with reordered codecs should succeed transceiver.setCodecPreferences is not a function
FAIL setCodecPreferences() on audio transceiver with codecs returned from getCapabilities('video') should throw InvalidAccessError Test bug: unrecognized DOMException code "() => transceiver.setCodecPreferences(capabilities.codecs)" passed to assert_throws()
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with user defined codec should throw InvalidAccessError Test bug: unrecognized DOMException code "() => transceiver.setCodecPreferences(codecs)" passed to assert_throws()
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with user defined codec together with codecs returned from getCapabilities() should throw InvalidAccessError Test bug: unrecognized DOMException code "() => transceiver.setCodecPreferences(codecs)" passed to assert_throws()
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with modified codecs returned from getCapabilities() should throw InvalidAccessError Test bug: unrecognized DOMException code "() => transceiver.setCodecPreferences(codecs)" passed to assert_throws()
Harness: the test ran to completion.
