This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setDirection should change transceiver.direction Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setDirection with same direction should have no effect Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
FAIL setDirection should change transceiver.direction independent of transceiver.currentDirection Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'. 'unified-plan' will become the default behavior in the future, but it is currently experimental. To try it out, construct the RTCPeerConnection with sdpSemantics:'unified-plan' present in the RTCConfiguration argument.
Harness: the test ran to completion.
