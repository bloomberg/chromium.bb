This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setRemoteDescription(rollback) in have-remote-offer state should revert to stable state promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The provided value 'rollback' is not a valid enum value of type RTCSdpType."
FAIL setRemoteDescription(rollback) from stable state should reject with InvalidStateError assert_throws: function "function() { throw e }" threw object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The provided value 'rollback' is not a valid enum value of type RTCSdpType." that is not a DOMException InvalidStateError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 11
FAIL setRemoteDescription(rollback) should ignore invalid sdp content and succeed promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The provided value 'rollback' is not a valid enum value of type RTCSdpType."
FAIL local offer created before setRemoteDescription(remote offer) then rollback should still be usable promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The provided value 'rollback' is not a valid enum value of type RTCSdpType."
FAIL local offer created before setRemoteDescription(remote offer) with different transceiver level assignments then rollback should still be usable promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'setRemoteDescription' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The provided value 'rollback' is not a valid enum value of type RTCSdpType."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
