This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Relative URL scope keys / should work with no prefix

PASS Relative URL scope keys / should work with /s, ?s, and #s
PASS Relative URL scope keys / should work with an empty string scope key
PASS Relative URL scope keys / should work with / suffixes
PASS Relative URL scope keys / should deduplicate based on URL parsing rules
FAIL Absolute URL scope keys / should only accept absolute URL scope keys with fetch schemes assert_object_equals: expected property "0" missing
FAIL Absolute URL scope keys / should parse absolute URL scope keys, ignoring unparseable ones assert_object_equals: expected property "0" missing
FAIL Absolute URL scope keys / should ignore relative URL scope keys when the base URL is a data: URL assert_object_equals: expected property "0" missing
Harness: the test ran to completion.
