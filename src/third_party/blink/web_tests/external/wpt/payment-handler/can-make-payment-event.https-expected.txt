This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL If a payment handler is not installed, then the payment method is not supported. assert_equals: If it throws, then it must be NotAllowedError expected "NotAllowedError" but got "UnknownError"
FAIL If CanMakePaymentEvent.respondWith(false) is called, then the payment method is not supported. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotAllowedError: Not allowed to install this payment handler"
FAIL If CanMakePaymentEvent.respondWith(Promise.resolve(false)) is called, then the payment method is not supported. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotAllowedError: Not allowed to install this payment handler"
FAIL If CanMakePaymentEvent.respondWith(true) is called, then the payment method is supported. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotAllowedError: Not allowed to install this payment handler"
FAIL If CanMakePaymentEvent.respondWith(Promise.resolve(true)) is called, then the payment method is supported. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotAllowedError: Not allowed to install this payment handler"
FAIL If CanMakePaymentEvent.respondWith(Promise.reject(error)) is called, then the payment method is not supported. promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotAllowedError: Not allowed to install this payment handler"
FAIL If an app supports "basic-card" in general and that's what merchant requests as well, then capability filtering should make the app available for use. CanMakePaymentEvent should not be fired for "basic-card". promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotAllowedError: Not allowed to install this payment handler"
FAIL If an app has less specific "basic-card" capabilites than merchant's request, capability filtering should not make the app available for use. CanMakePaymentEvent should not be fired for "basic-card".  promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotAllowedError: Not allowed to install this payment handler"
FAIL If an app has the exact "basic-card" capabilities that a merchant requested, capability filtering should make the app available for use. CanMakePaymentEvent should not be fired for "basic-card". promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotAllowedError: Not allowed to install this payment handler"
FAIL If an app has more specific "basic-card" capabilities than merchant's request, capability filtering should make the app available for use. CanMakePaymentEvent should not be fired for "basic-card". promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotAllowedError: Not allowed to install this payment handler"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
