This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Tokenization of "noreferrer" should skip window features separators before feature assert_equals: " noreferrer" should activate feature "noreferrer" expected null but got object "[object Window]"
FAIL Feature "noreferrer" should be converted to ASCII lowercase assert_equals: "NOREFERRER" should activate feature "noreferrer" expected null but got object "[object Window]"
FAIL After "noreferrer", tokenization should skip window features separators that are not "=" or "," assert_equals: "noreferrer" should activate feature "noreferrer" expected null but got object "[object Window]"
FAIL Tokenizing "noreferrer" should ignore window feature separators except "," after initial "=" and before value assert_equals: "noreferrer=  yes" should activate feature "noreferrer" expected null but got object "[object Window]"
FAIL Tokenizing "noreferrer" should read characters until first window feature separator as `value` assert_equals: "noreferrer=1" should set "noreferrer" expected null but got object "[object Window]"
FAIL Integer values other than 0 should activate the feature assert_equals: "noreferrer=1" should activate feature "noreferrer" expected null but got object "[object Window]"
PASS Integer value of 0 should not activate "noreferrer"
PASS Invalid feature names should not tokenize as "noreferrer"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
