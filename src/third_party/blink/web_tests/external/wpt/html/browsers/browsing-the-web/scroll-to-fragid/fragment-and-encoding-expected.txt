This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS U+00FF should find U+00FF
PASS Percent-encoded UTF-8 BOM should find U+FEFF as BOM is not stripped when decoding
FAIL %FF should not find U+00FF as decoding it gives U+FFFD assert_equals: #%FF expected 0 but got 9416
PASS Valid UTF-8 + invalid UTF-8 should not be matched to the utf8-decoded former + the isomorphic-decoded latter
Harness: the test ran to completion.
