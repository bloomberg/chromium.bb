This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL If node is a host-including inclusive ancestor of parent, then throw a HierarchyRequestError DOMException. assert_throws_dom: function "() => insert(doc.body, doc.body)" threw object "TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined" that is not a DOMException HierarchyRequestError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 3

FAIL If node is a Text node and parent is a document, then throw a HierarchyRequestError DOMException. assert_throws_dom: function "() => insert(doc, doc.createTextNode("text"))" threw object "TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined" that is not a DOMException HierarchyRequestError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 3
FAIL If node is a doctype and parent is not a document, then throw a HierarchyRequestError DOMException. assert_throws_dom: function "() => insert(doc.createElement("a"), doctype)" threw object "TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined" that is not a DOMException HierarchyRequestError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 3
FAIL If node is a DocumentFragment with multiple elements and parent is a document, then throw a HierarchyRequestError DOMException. assert_throws_dom: function "() => insert(doc, df)" threw object "TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined" that is not a DOMException HierarchyRequestError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 3
FAIL If node is a DocumentFragment with an element and parent is a document with another element, then throw a HierarchyRequestError DOMException. assert_throws_dom: function "() => insert(doc, df)" threw object "TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined" that is not a DOMException HierarchyRequestError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 3
FAIL If node is an Element and parent is a document with another element, then throw a HierarchyRequestError DOMException. assert_throws_dom: function "() => insert(doc, el)" threw object "TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined" that is not a DOMException HierarchyRequestError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 3
FAIL If node is a doctype and parent is a document with another doctype, then throw a HierarchyRequestError DOMException. assert_throws_dom: function "() => insert(doc, doctype)" threw object "TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined" that is not a DOMException HierarchyRequestError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 3
