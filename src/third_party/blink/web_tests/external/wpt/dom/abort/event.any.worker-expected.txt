This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS AbortController abort() should fire event synchronously
PASS controller.signal should always return the same object
PASS controller.abort() should do nothing the second time it is called
PASS event handler should not be called if added after controller.abort()
PASS the abort event should have the right properties
FAIL the AbortSignal.abort() static returns an already aborted signal AbortSignal.abort is not a function
Harness: the test ran to completion.
