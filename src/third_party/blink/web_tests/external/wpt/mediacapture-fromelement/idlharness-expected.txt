This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Test mediacapture-fromelement IDL interfaces
PASS Partial interface HTMLMediaElement: original interface defined
PASS Partial interface HTMLCanvasElement: original interface defined
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface object length
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface object name
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: attribute canvas
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for canvas property on CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: operation requestFrame()
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for requestFrame() on CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack must be primary interface of canvas.captureStream().getTracks()[0]
PASS Stringification of canvas.captureStream().getTracks()[0]
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: canvas.captureStream().getTracks()[0] must inherit property "canvas" with the proper type
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: canvas.captureStream().getTracks()[0] must inherit property "requestFrame()" with the proper type
PASS HTMLMediaElement interface: operation captureStream()
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for captureStream() on HTMLMediaElement
FAIL HTMLMediaElement interface: document.getElementById("media") must inherit property "captureStream()" with the proper type assert_inherits: property "captureStream" not found in prototype chain
PASS HTMLCanvasElement interface: operation captureStream(double)
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for captureStream(double) on HTMLCanvasElement
PASS HTMLCanvasElement interface: document.getElementById("canvas") must inherit property "captureStream(double)" with the proper type
PASS HTMLCanvasElement interface: calling captureStream(double) on document.getElementById("canvas") with too few arguments must throw TypeError
Harness: the test ran to completion.
