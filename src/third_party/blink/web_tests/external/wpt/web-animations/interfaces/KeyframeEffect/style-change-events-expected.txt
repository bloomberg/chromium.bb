This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL All property keys are recognized assert_in_array: Test property 'iterationComposite' should be one of the properties on  KeyframeEffect value "iterationComposite" not in array ["getTiming", "getComputedTiming", "updateTiming", "target", "composite", "pseudoElement", "getKeyframes", "setKeyframes", "KeyframeEffect constructor", "KeyframeEffect copy constructor"]
PASS KeyframeEffect.getTiming does NOT trigger a style change event
PASS KeyframeEffect.getComputedTiming does NOT trigger a style change event
PASS KeyframeEffect.updateTiming does NOT trigger a style change event
PASS KeyframeEffect.target does NOT trigger a style change event
PASS KeyframeEffect.composite does NOT trigger a style change event
PASS KeyframeEffect.pseudoElement does NOT trigger a style change event
PASS KeyframeEffect.getKeyframes does NOT trigger a style change event
PASS KeyframeEffect.setKeyframes does NOT trigger a style change event
PASS KeyframeEffect.KeyframeEffect constructor does NOT trigger a style change event
PASS KeyframeEffect.KeyframeEffect copy constructor does NOT trigger a style change event
Harness: the test ran to completion.
