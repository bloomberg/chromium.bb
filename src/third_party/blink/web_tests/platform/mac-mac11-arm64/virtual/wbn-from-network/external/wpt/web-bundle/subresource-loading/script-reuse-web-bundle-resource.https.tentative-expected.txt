This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS A webbundle should be fetched again when new script element is appended.
PASS 'remove(), then append()' should reuse webbundle resources
PASS 'remove(), then append()' should reuse webbundle resources and both scripts should fire load events
PASS 'remove(), then append()' should reuse webbundle resources and both scripts should fire error events
PASS Should reuse webbundle resources if a credential mode is same
PASS Should not reuse webbundle resources if a credentials mode is different (same-origin vs omit)
FAIL Should not reuse webbundle resources if a credential mode is different (same-origin vs include assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
FAIL 'remove(), then append()' for the same element should reuse webbundle resources assert_equals: expected 1 but got 2
PASS Multiple 'remove(), then append()' for the same element should reuse webbundle resources
PASS 'remove(), then append() in a separate task' should not reuse webbundle resources
PASS replaceWith() should reuse webbundle resources.
FAIL append() should reuse webbundle resoruces even if the old script was moved to another document. assert_equals: expected 1 but got 0
PASS Even if the bundle is still loading, we should reuse the resources.
PASS When reusing the resources with script2, a load event should be fired regardless of if the script1 fired a load
PASS When reusing the resources with script2, an error event should be fired regardless of if the script1 fired an error
Harness: the test ran to completion.
