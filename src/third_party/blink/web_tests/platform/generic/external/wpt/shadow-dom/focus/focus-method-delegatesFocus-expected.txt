This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS focus() on host with delegatesFocus, all tabindex=0
PASS focus() on host with delegatesFocus & tabindex =-1, all other tabindex=0
PASS focus() on host with delegatesFocus & no tabindex, all other tabindex=0
PASS focus() on host with delegatesFocus & tabindex = 0, all other tabindex=-1
PASS focus() on host with delegatesFocus, all without tabindex
PASS focus() on host with delegatesFocus, all tabindex=-1
PASS focus() on host with delegatesFocus & tabindex=0, #belowSlots with tabindex=0
PASS focus() on host with delegatesFocus & tabindex=0, #outside with tabindex=0
PASS focus() on host with delegatesFocus & tabindex=0, #aboveSlots and #belowSlots with tabindex=0
PASS focus() on host with delegatesFocus & tabindex=0, #aboveSlots with tabindex=0 and #belowSlots with tabindex=1
FAIL focus() on host with delegatesFocus & tabindex=0, #slottedToFirstSlot, #slottedToSecondSlot, #belowSlots  with tabindex=0 assert_equals: expected Element node <div tabindex="0">belowSlots</div> but got null
PASS focus() on host with delegatesFocus and already-focused non-first shadow descendant
FAIL focus() on host with delegatesFocus with another host with no delegatesFocus and a focusable child assert_equals: expected Element node <input></input> but got Element node <span></span>
PASS focus() on host with delegatesFocus with another host with delegatesFocus and a focusable child
FAIL focus() on host with delegatesFocus and slotted focusable children assert_equals: expected Element node <div><div><input></div></div> but got Element node <input></input>
Harness: the test ran to completion.
