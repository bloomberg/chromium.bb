This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS high fetchPriority on dynamically-inserted <script>s translates to kHigh resource load priority
PASS low fetchPriority on dynamically-inserted <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS auto fetchPriority on dynamically-inserted <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS invalid fetchPriority on dynamically-inserted <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS missing fetchPriority on dynamically-inserted <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS high fetchPriority on dynamically-inserted module <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
FAIL low fetchPriority on dynamically-inserted module <script>s translates to kLow resource load priority assert_equals: expected 1 but got 3
PASS auto fetchPriority on dynamically-inserted module <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS invalid fetchPriority on dynamically-inserted module <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS missing fetchPriority on dynamically-inserted module <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
Harness: the test ran to completion.
