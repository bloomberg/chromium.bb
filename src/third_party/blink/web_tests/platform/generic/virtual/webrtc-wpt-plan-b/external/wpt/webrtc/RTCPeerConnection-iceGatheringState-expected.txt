This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Initial iceGatheringState should be new
PASS iceGatheringState should eventually become complete after setLocalDescription
FAIL setLocalDescription(reoffer) with no new transports should not cause iceGatheringState to change promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
PASS setLocalDescription() with no transports should not cause iceGatheringState to change
FAIL setLocalDescription(reoffer) with a new transport should cause iceGatheringState to go to "checking" and then "complete" promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL sRD does not cause ICE gathering state changes promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL renegotiation that closes all transports should result in ICE gathering state "new" promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL connection with one data channel should eventually have connected connection state promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'transport')"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
