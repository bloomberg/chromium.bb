This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL A transceiver added and stopped before the initial offer generation should not trigger an offer m-section generation promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL A transceiver added and stopped should not crash when getting receiver's transport promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL During renegotiation, adding and stopping a transceiver should not trigger a renegotiated offer m-section generation promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL A stopped sendonly transceiver should generate an inactive m-section in the offer promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL A stopped inactive transceiver should generate an inactive m-section in the offer promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL If a transceiver is stopped locally, setting a locally generated answer should still work promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL If a transceiver is stopped remotely, setting a locally generated answer should still work promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL If a transceiver is stopped, transceivers, senders and receivers should disappear after offer/answer promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL If a transceiver is stopped, transceivers should end up in state stopped promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
