This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS insertDTMF() should succeed if tones contains valid DTMF characters
PASS insertDTMF() should throw InvalidCharacterError if tones contains invalid DTMF characters
FAIL insertDTMF() should throw InvalidStateError if transceiver is stopped Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'.
FAIL insertDTMF() should throw InvalidStateError if transceiver.currentDirection is recvonly promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL insertDTMF() should throw InvalidStateError if transceiver.currentDirection is inactive promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
PASS insertDTMF() should set toneBuffer to provided tones normalized, with old tones overridden
PASS insertDTMF() after remove and close should reject
Harness: the test ran to completion.
