This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Test cookie domain attribute parsing
PASS Return cookie for a domain match
PASS No cookie returned for domain mismatch (subdomains differ post-redirect)
PASS Return cookie for a domain match with leading '.'
PASS Return cookie for domain match (domain attribute is suffix of the host name and first level subdomain)
PASS Return cookie for domain match (domain attribute is suffix of the host name and first level subdomain, with leading '.')
PASS No cookie returned for domain mismatch (subdomains differ, with leading '.')
PASS No cookie returned for domain mismatch when cookie was created (which would match after the redirect, with one subdomain level)
PASS Return cookie for domain match (domain attribute is suffix of the host name, with leading '.')
PASS Return cookie for domain match (domain attribute is suffix of the host name)
PASS No cookie returned for domain attribute with double leading '.'
PASS No cookie returned for domain attribute with subdomain followed by ..
FAIL Return cookie for a domain match with leading whitespace and '.' assert_equals: The cookie was set as expected. expected (string) "test=12" but got (undefined) undefined
PASS No cookie returned for domain attribute with whitespace that surrounds a leading '.'
PASS No cookie returned for domain attribute with trailing '.'
PASS No cookie returned for domain attribute with trailing '..'
PASS No cookie returned for domain attribute with trailing whitespace and '.'
PASS No cookie returned for domain attribute with TLD as value
PASS No cookie returned for domain attribute with TLD as value, with leading '.'
PASS No cookie returned for domain attribute with TLD as value, with leading and trailing '.'
PASS Return multiple cookies that match on domain (without and with leading '.')
PASS Return multiple cookies that match on domain (with and without leading '.')
PASS No cookie returned for domain attribute value between quotes
PASS Return multiple cookies that match on subdomain and domain (without and with leading '.')
PASS Return multiple cookies that match on domain and subdomain (with and without leading '.')
PASS No cookie returned when domain attribute does not domain-match (and first does)
FAIL Return cookie for domain attribute match (first does not, but second does) assert_equals: The cookie was set as expected. expected "test=25" but got ""
PASS Return cookie for domain match (with bizarre capitalization for domain attribute value)
PASS No cookie returned for domain attribute value with port
PASS No cookie returned for domain mismatch when cookie was created (which would match after the redirect, with two subdomain levels)
PASS No cookie returned for cookie set on different domain (with no domain attribute)
PASS Return cookie set with bare domain= attribute
PASS Return cookie that domain-matches with bizarre-cased URL
PASS No cookie returned for domain attribute mismatch (first attribute matches, but second does not)
PASS Return cookie for domain match (first attribute doesn't, but second does)
PASS Return cookie for domain match (first attribute matches, second doesn't, third does)
PASS No cookie returned for domain attribute mismatch (first attribute doesn't, second does, third doesn't)
PASS Return cookie for domain match (with two identical domain attributes)
PASS Return cookie for domain match (with first domain attribute a match for host name and second as suffix of host name)
PASS Return cookie for domain match (with first domain attribute as suffix of host name and second a match for host name)
PASS No cookie set on domain mismatch before a (domain matching) redirect
PASS No cookie set on domain mismatch before a (domain matching) redirect (for second level subdomain)
PASS Return cookie for domain match (with first domain attribute as suffix of host name and second a bare attribute)
PASS No cookie returned for domain mismatch (with domain mismatch as first domain attribute and second a bare attribute)
PASS No cookie returned for domain mismatch (first attribute is a different subdomain and second is bare)
PASS Cookies with same name, path, and domain (differing only in leading '.') overwrite each other ('.' second)
PASS Cookies with same name, path, and domain (differing only in leading '.') overwrite each other ('.' first)
Harness: the test ran to completion.
