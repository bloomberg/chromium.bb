# These owners approve changes to VirtualTestSuites.
#
# The following things should be checked whether they are justified in the
# CL description:
# - If the CL adds virtual tests (by adding new virtual suites or new
#   directories to existing virtual suties), how many tests the CL adds.
# - If the number of new tests is big (e.g. >=1000),
#   - Whether the new tests can be skipped on some platforms / OS versions.
#   - Whether the new directories are essential for test coverage.
#   - Whether other alternatives [1] are more suitable than virtual suites.
#   - How much more time of the swarm jobs for the blink_web_tests step on
#     bots will take.
