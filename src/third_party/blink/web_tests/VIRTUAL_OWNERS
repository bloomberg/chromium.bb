# These owners approve changes to VirtualTestSuites.
#
# The following things should be checked whether they are justified in the
# CL description:
# - If the CL adds virtual tests (by adding new virtual suites or new
#   directories to existing virtual suties), how many tests the CL adds.
# - If the number of new tests is big (e.g. >=500)
#   - Whether the new tests can be skipped on some platforms / OS versions.
#   - Whether the new directories are essential for test coverage.
#   - Whether other alternatives [1] are more suitable than virtual suites.
#   - The percentage of time the virtual suite will take. The author can
#     find this data in "layout_test_results" page ("Timing stats" in the
#     top-right corner) linked from "archive results for blink_web_tests"
#     step on try bots like linux-rel, mac-rel and win10_chromium_x64_rel_ng.
#     Normally the percentage should be less than 5%.
