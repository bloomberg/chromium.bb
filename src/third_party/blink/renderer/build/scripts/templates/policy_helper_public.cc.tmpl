// trial add their feature names to this map unconditionally, as the trial token
// could be added after the HTTP header needs to be parsed. This also means that
// top-level documents which simply want to embed another page which uses an
// origin trial feature, without using the feature themselves, can use
// permissions policy to allow use of the feature in subframes (The framed
// document will still require a valid origin trial token to use the feature in
// this scenario).
