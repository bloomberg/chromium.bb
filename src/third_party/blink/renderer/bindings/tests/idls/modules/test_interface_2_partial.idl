// Regression test for https://crbug.com/603782: if the main interface is
// declared in 'core', the alphabetically first partial interface in 'modules'
// with a RuntimeEnabled will leak onto all of the other partial interfaces in
// 'modules' that do not have an extended attributes section (i.e.,
// TestInterface2Partial2.idl).
//
// This test ensures that TestInterface2Partial2 is NOT conditional on the
// Interface2PartialRuntimeFeature runtime flag.
