# This file lists all dependencies used from first-party code. It should not
# include transitive dependencies, as those will be determined from Cargo.
#
# All versions should be specified as a version epoch (a single non-zero version
# component such as "2" or "0.3").
#   e.g.
#   santas-workshop = "2"
#
# Any features used by first-party code must be declared here in order to ensure
# they are included in the crate when it is built.
#   e.g.
#   santas-workshop = { version = "3", features = [ "candycanes" ] }
