// The Cast Streaming Receiver, a peer corresponding to some Cast Streaming
// Sender at the other end of a network link.
//
// Cast Streaming is a transport protocol which divides up the frames for one
// media stream (e.g., audio or video) into multiple RTP packets containing an
// encrypted payload. The Receiver is the peer responsible for collecting the
// RTP packets, decrypting the payload, and re-assembling a frame that can be
// passed to a decoder and played out.
//
// A Sender â†” Receiver pair is used to transport each media stream. Typically,
// there are two pairs in a normal system, one for the audio stream and one for
// video stream. A local player is responsible for synchronizing the playout of
// the frames of each stream to achieve lip-sync. See the discussion in
// encoded_frame.h for how the |reference_time| and |rtp_timestamp| of the
// EncodedFrames are used to achieve this.
