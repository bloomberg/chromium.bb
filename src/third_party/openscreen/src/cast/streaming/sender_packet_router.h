// Manages network packet transmission for one or more Senders, directing each
// inbound packet to a specific Sender instance, pacing the transmission of
// outbound packets, and employing network bandwidth/availability monitoring and
// congestion control.
//
// Instead of just sending packets whenever they want, Senders must request
// transmission from the SenderPacketRouter. The router then calls-back to each
// Sender, in the near future, when it has allocated an available time slice for
// transmission. The Sender is allowed to decide, at that exact moment, which
// packet most needs to be sent.
//
// Pacing strategy: Packets are sent in bursts. This allows the platform
// (operating system) to collect many small packets into a short-term buffer,
// which allows for optimizations at the link layer. For example, multiple
// packets can be sent together as one larger transmission unit, and this can be
// critical for good performance over shared-medium networks (such as 802.11
// WiFi). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-bursting
