# Raspberry Pi

The following instructions apply to
the
[Raspberry Pi 2 Model B v1.2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/).
Other models may work just fine but YMMV.

## Preparing the Raspberry Pi

You will need:

* 4GB or bigger microSD card
* USB drive adapter or other way to flash microSD
* (Optional) 802.11 USB WiFi nano module - [recommended model](https://www.adafruit.com/product/814)

Either of the flash instructions below will make a bootable microSD card.

### Flashing via GUI

2. Download [Etcher](https://etcher.io/) for your OS
3. Plug in the microSD card
4. Run Etcher, select the Raspbian zipfile and the microSD card, click Flash
5. Make a coffee
