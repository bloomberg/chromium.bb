// This class is responsible for both tracking what records have been registered
// to mDNS as well as publishing new mDNS records to the network.
// When a new record is published, it will be announced 8 times, starting at an
// interval of 1 second, with the interval doubling each successive
// announcement. This same announcement process is followed when an existing
// record is updated. When it is removed, a Goodbye message must be sent if the
// record is unique.
//
// Prior to publishing a record, the domain name for this service instance must
// be claimed using the ClaimExclusiveOwnership() function. This function probes
// the network to determine whether the chosen name exists, modifying the
// chosen name as described in RFC 6762 if a collision is found.
//
// NOTE: All MdnsPublisher instances must be run on the same task runner thread,
// due to the shared announce + goodbye message queue.
