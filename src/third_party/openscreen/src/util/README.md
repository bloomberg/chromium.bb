# Utility Code

The util/ folder is meant to house core utility classes and logic that can be
used by everything else in the Open Screen repository. Code here is permitted
to include platform/api/ -- same as the rest of the repository. Includes things
like string utils, the JSON serializer, our std_util.h header, and the alarm.
