Description: Robolectric is a unit test framework for Android.
Local Modifications:
- Hardcoded version number in robolectric-version.properties.
- Hardcoded ShadowProvider service config files. These files are normally
  generated at compile time but it is difficult to use the generated file
  with GN.
- Provided stub implementation of MavenDependencyResolver.java to avoid
  needing maven third_party libraries.
- Added custom_asynctask folder to have workable copies of shadows required
  for our own implementation of AsyncTask
- Added DefaultSdkProvider as a local file with Jellybean references removed.
- Removed non-compiling JDK9 class from UnsafeAccess.java.
How To Update:
- Visit the migration guide to see which APIs changed and need updating.
  http://robolectric.org/migrating/
- Have git admins create a branch for the version in
  https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/robolectric and set DEPS to the
  revision.
- Read through the build.gradle files and make sure all of the depenencies
  in our BUILD.gn file are correct.
- Update the source files and add their names in our BUILD.gn file.
- Update local/robolectric/src/main/resources/robolectric-version.properties
  to the new Robolectric version.
- Update CIPD package to include the new Robolectric Android libraries file
  and replace the references to the previous ones with the new one.
