Description:
This project contains a header file (webauthn.h) for the native Windows 10
WebAuthn API (webauthn.dll). While the API is already shipping with Windows 10
Insider Preview builds (as of November 2018), the corresponding header file has
not yet been released into a Windows SDK that Chromium can depend on. We
therefore include the header via this open source repository for the time
being.

Local Modifications:
- added BUILD.gn and README.chromium
