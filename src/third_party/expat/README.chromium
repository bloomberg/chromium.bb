Patches:
    0001-Do-not-redefine-lean-and-mean.patch:
      * Do not redefine WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN which breaks the Windows
        build because it uses -Werror,-Wmacro-redefined .
    0002-Add-missing-include-for-malloc-free.patch:
      * Include stdlib.h for declaration of malloc, free.

Added files:
  lib/expat_config.h (a generated config file)
