// The resolve_table test checks if it can resolve table paths.
// Amongst other scenarios it also tests if relative paths can be
// resolved. For that reason the test needs to be run in the test dir.
// This is not the case in VPATH builds. So we need to do a chdir into
// the test dir and we need to know the lecation of the test dir. This
// is achieved via this header file which is adapted while configuring.
