Liblouis tests
==============

This is an example test file in reStructuredText format

Define the table you want to test and initiate the test helper

    >>> tables = ['en-GB-g2.ctb']
    >>> t = TestHelper(tables)

Now do some tests.

Check that "the" is correctly contracted
    >>> t.braille('the cat sat on the mat')
    u'! cat sat on ! mat'

Make sure that "to" is contracted correctly and joined to next word.
    >>> t.braille('to the moon')
    u'6! moon'

Check that "to" at end of line doesn't get contracted, and that "went"
is expanded when cursor is positioned within the word.
    >>> t.cursor('you went to', 4)
    (u'y went to', 2)
