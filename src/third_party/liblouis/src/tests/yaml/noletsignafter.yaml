# There seems to be an issue when using the noletsignafter opcode. For
# grade 1 contraction in the Norwegian language, we are using it to
# prevent single letters in lists to be preceded by the legsign, e.g. dot
# 56.

# The problem is that using 'noletsignafter .', the following string is
# being misinterpreted:

#   1,7f.15

# the number 7 after the comma is omitted in the output result.
