# The reason the `=` operand works most of the time is the fact that
# most of the time, a given dot pattern will back-translate to its
# original characters if no rules tell the back-translator otherwise.

# It will not work when the "=" rule exists to circumvent another rule
# that would also affect back-translation, e.g. if a table contains
# the following rules:

# always ooo 135-135
# word foobar =

# The dot pattern 124-135-135-12-1-1235 will back-translate to fooobar
# as specified by the first rule.

# Not a very practical example, I admit, but it demonstrates the
# problem.

# I think the = operand is originally a good idea, because it is a
# clear way of saying that the string should be matched by the basic
# dot pattern. If it were to work also for back-translation, perhaps
# the = sign should be replaced internally by the corresponding dot
# pattern at compile time.
