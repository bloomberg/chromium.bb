# liblouis braille Table - Esperanto X System
# Created by Aaron Cannon <cannona@fireantproductions.com>

#
# This file extends the Esperanto table with support for the X System.
# The X system is a means of writing the accented letters of Esperanto
# C-Circumflex, G-Circumflex, H-Circumflex, J-Circumflex, S-Circumflex,
# and U-Breve on systems where Unicode is either not available or not
# practical. It is especially common among blind Esperantists, as until
# recently, screen readers did not support reading the unicode
# characters that Esperanto uses.
#
# In short, in the x-system, an X is written after each letter with an
# accent.  I.E. "cx, gx, hx, jx, sx or ux".
#
# This system is not generally ambiguous because the Esperanto alphabet
# does not contain the letter X.
#
# The H-system originally proposed by L. L. Zamenhof is rarely used
# because it is ambiguous, as H is part of the Esperanto alphabet, and
#  in that system, U-circumflex is not marked at all.
