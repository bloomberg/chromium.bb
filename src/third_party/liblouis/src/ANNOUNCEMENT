The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.7.0. The release is available for download at:

    https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages[1].
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and
is used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion
project liblouisutdml[2] deals with formatting of braille.

Changes in this release
=======================

This release implements major improvements for back-translation thanks
to concerted efforts by Bue Vester-Andersen, Bert Frees, Timothy Lee
and others. In particular the input/output positions are now correct
also for back-translation. There are new and improved Chinese Braille
tables and some long awaited improvements to UEB. The release also has
some code cleanups and documentation improvements.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues[3].

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added a new opcode `midendnumericmodechars'. Characters defined with
  this opcode can appear in the middle or at the end of a number
  without canceling numeric mode. Thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Fix another stack-based buffer overflow in input parsing reported by
  Henri Salo thanks to Christian Egli.
- Fix input/output positions for back-translation. Thanks to excellent
  bug reports and patches by Timothy Lee, Bert Frees heroically sat
  down and reworked the handling of the input/output positions for
  back-translation. This solves numerous issues with backward
  translation.
- The returned `inlen' and `outlen' now always match thanks to the
  above work on input/output positions by Bert Frees.
- Major improvements in the back-translation of capitalized words
  (`capsword') in conjunction with punctuation and numbers. Thanks to
  Bue Vester-Andersen
- Fixed a problem in the back-translation of numbers in conjunction
  with punctuation and letters. Thanks to Rimas Kudelis and Bue
  Vester-Andersen
- Fix a buffer overflow in `matchCurrentInput'. Thanks to Hongxu Chen
  for reporting and to Christian Egli for fixing it.

Braille table improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Danish grade 2 tables: Reduced hyphenation to only the hyphens
  necessary for correct Braille translation. Replaced the longer rules
  with hyphenation for better cursor positioning. Corrected some
  words. Thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.
- New Chinese Mandarin Braille Codes (Grade 1) and (Grade 2) thanks to
  Sunian Loomee. The first one is for Chinese Common Braille, commonly
  known as the old Braille where a Chinese character is composed of
  three Braille Symbols, consonants, vowels and tones. The second
  table is for Chinese double spelling Braille, commonly known as the
  new Braille where Chinese character is composed of two Braille
  Symbols, consonants and vowels and the tones are included in vowels.
- Major update to the Urdu tables thanks to Jake Kyle.
- Back-translation of numbers in Latvian, Polish, Portuguese, Serbian,
  and Swedish has been fixed thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.
- Improvements to UEB such as handling of /BLT/, /BLVD/ and /LLC/,
  number sign placement, final-letter groupsign usage and final-letter
  back-translation thanks to Mike Gray.
- Significant changes to Bopomofo-based Chinese Braille. Among other
  things there is now complete the support of /CJK Unified Ideographs
  Extension A/ and some symbols were added for Nemeth. Thanks to
  Sponge Jhan and 黃偉豪.

Other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added documentation of opcodes which were previously introduced as
  part of the UEB work. Thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.
- Test suite improvements: In addition to checking the translation the
  tests now also check if the provided `inlen' is the same as the
  returned `inlen' and retry the test with a larger output buffer.
- Fix a problem in the Makefiles that prevented liblouis from being
  built with automake 1.16. This is fixed now thanks to a patch from
  Samuel Thibault.
- Removal of the code for the /scripting language/ for multipass
  opcodes. This code was originally introduced in 2012 but never
  documented. Consequently it was never used. Meanwhile the original
  code for multipass opcodes was much improved. So there is no more
  need for this (duplicate) code and we are removing it.
- The nightly snapshots of pre-built windows binaries are now built
  with UCS4 enabled.
