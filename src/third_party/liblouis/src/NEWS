* Noteworthy changes in release 3.11.0 (2019-09-02)
A tremendous amount of work by Dave Mielke and Bert Frees has gone
into this release. They have improved liblouis for use on note taker
devices, for backwards translation and a number of languages. Many
other contributors (listed below) have also helped in fixing bugs and
improving braille tables, such as Dutch, Mongolian, Polish, Ancient
Greek, Danish, Irish, Chinese, and American Braille Computer Code.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/21?closed=1][the list of closed
issues]].

** New features
- Enable ~always~ rules with a single character and a single braille
  cell for back-translation. Thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.
- Implement ~noUndefined~ mode for forward translation, thanks to Dave
  Mielke.
- Use fallback braille representations (NABCC) for rendering undefined
  characters in hexadecimal notation, thanks to Dave Mielke.
- Always render undefined characters, also ASCII characters, in
  hexadecimal notation.
- Add a new metadata field ~index-name~ for selecting a table from a
  list fast and efficiently. It has the most important information
  first and no redundant information. It should look nice when sorted.
  This in contrast to the existing ~display-name~ field which is for
  describing a table accurately and should sound good. Thanks to Dave
  Mielke and Bert Frees.

** Bug fixes
- Don't let a caps passage end on a word with no letters. Thanks to
  Bert Frees.
- Handle word resets in the last word of an caps or emphasis passage
  if the end indicator was placed before the word. Thanks to Bert
  Frees.
- Never convert to lowercase if ~capsletter~ is not defined. Thanks to
  Bert Frees.
- Fix position mapping for back-translation when ~noUndefined~ mode is
  active. Thanks to Dave Mielke.
- Fix bug where a translation would hang on words that match both a
  ~nocont~ and a ~repeated~ rule. Thanks to Dave Mielke.
- Fix bug where the effect of ~capsnocont~ would leak to the next word
  if that word starts with a capital. Thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.

** Braille table improvements
- Fix an issue with ordinal numbers inside caps passages in Dutch
  braille. Thanks to Bert Frees.
- Improved back-translation for Mongolian thanks to Angaragerdene.
- Fixes to Polish grade 1 and Polish computer braille thanks to Łukasz
  Golonka.
- Improvements to Ancient Greek braille, which has been renamed "Greek
  international braille". A version with composed accents is made
  available as a .uti table. Thanks to Dave Mielke and Μαρια
  Γεωργακαράκου (Maria Georgakarakou).
- Various improvements to modern Greek thanks to Dave Mielke.
- Improvements and fixes to Spanish contracted braille. Details in
  #741. Thanks to Juan Pablo Bello.
- Improvements and fixes to the Danish tables. Thanks to Bue
  Vester-Andersen.
- Add a display table to match Word CX which is used in Norway and
  Sweden, and maybe also in other countries thanks to Lars Bjørndal.
- Fix handling of colon within number in Dutch braille, thanks to Jake
  Kyle.
- Fix translation of bullet and dot operators in Dutch braille, thanks
  to Paul Rambags
- Added North American Braille Computer Code table (~en-nabcc.utb~)
  which is the counterpart of the ~text_nabcc.dis~ display table.
  Thanks to Dave Mielke.
- Add support for the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to the
  Chinese bopomofo braille table, thanks to Hurt Huang and Sponge
  Jhan. Various improvements, including dot patterns and test cases, to
  the Chinese bopomofo braille table, thanks to Sponge Jhan.
- Unified English Braille no longer displays a single underscore when
  multiple underscores are in the text, thanks to André-Abush Clause.
- Update to Afrikaans uncontracted braille and new table for contracted
  braille. Thanks to Christo de Klerk and Greg Kearney.
- Update Irish braille (contracted and uncontracted) to the May 2019
  version of the specification, thanks to Ronan McGuirk

** Other changes
- The python wrapper now encodes and decodes strings to/from UTF-16
  and UTF-32 using the surrogatepass error handler. This ensures that
  single UTF-16 surrogate characters are processed correctly by the
  wrapper and don't raise an encoding/decoding error. Thanks to
  Leonard de Ruijter.
- Metadata keys and values are now case insensitive, thanks to Dave
  Mielke.
- Remove ~unicodedefs.cti~. It was obsolete and never meant to be
  included by any tables. Instead use the online references as
  mentioned in the documentation now. See also #696.
- ~lou_checkyaml~ test reporting has been improved, thanks to Bert
  Frees. For example it now has a ~--verbose~ option so that printing
  of expected failures can be enabled.
- Hyphenation tables have been removed from tables except those needed
  for ~nocross~ rules, thanks to Bert Frees.

  The idea is that the caller (for example ~odt2braille~ or
  ~liblouisutdml~) should be able to decide for themselves which
  hyphenation table to use. The case in which a table contains nocross
  rules is an exception. In this case the hyphenation patterns are a
  real part of the table. Because it is not recommended to append an
  own hyphenation table in this case, a ~#-has-nocross~ metadata field
  was added to indicate that a table contains nocross rules.
- ~lou_hyphenate~ can now handle more than just words (sequences of
  letters), e.g compound words, thanks to Bert Frees.

** Deprecation notice
- The ~noUndefinedDots~ mode has been renamed to ~noUndefined~. For
  backwards compatibility ~noUndefinedDots~ is still available in the
  header file and in the Python bindings, as an alias for
  ~noUndefined~.

** Backwards incompatible changes
None

** Invisible changes
   - Internally separate more clearly the display and translation
     phases.

** New, renamed or removed tables
*** New
- grc-international-common.uti
- grc-international-composed.uti
- grc-international-decomposed.uti
- en-nabcc.utb

*** Renamed

*** Removed
- unicodedefs.cti
- fi-fi.ctb

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.10.0 (2019-06-03)
This release comes across as quiet, containing just the usual
assortment of braille table improvements, cleanups, bug fixes and the
classic buffer overflow patches. But beware, a lot has happened behind
the scenes. Bert and Davy have been adding a new opcode to handle
special emphasis situations. A number of annoying restrictions with
regards to names, such as class names have been removed thank to Bert.
And lastly also thanks to Bert it is now possible to define inline
display tables in your YAML tests.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/20?closed=1][the list of closed
issues]].

** New features
- Add a new opcode ~emphmodechars~. Thanks to Bert Frees and Davy
  Kager.

** Bug fixes
- Remove memoization in ~checkAttr~. It wasn't implemented correctly,
  caused some weird bugs and probably didn't do much for performance.
  Thanks to Bert Frees.
- Fix multiple buffer overflows in ~compilePassOpcode~. Thanks to
  Cheng Wen for the report and to Christian Egli for the fix.
- Fix a build problem when building without libyaml thanks to Bert
  Frees.

** Braille table improvements
- Added modified letters to UEB thanks to Mike Gray.
- Complete overhaul of the U.S. six-dot computer braille tables to
  align with the CBC standard thanks to Timothy Wynn. There is now a
  sub-table for EBAE (~en-us-compbrl.uti~) and a stand-alone table
  (~en-us-comp6.ctb~).
  - Conforms to the CBC standard from BANA for character definitions
    that differ from the 8-dot ASCII braille (11 punctuation marks).
  - Added rules for braille indicators, emphasis indicators, and
    isolated lower-cell signs to the stand-alone table.
  - Uncontracted and contracted EBAE tables no longer use dot 7 when
    in computer braille mode.
  - ~en-us-compbrl.ctb~ was deleted because it was identical to
    ~en-us-comp6.ctb~.
- Update Bopomofo-based Chinese Braille thanks to Sponge Jhan
  - Correct various dot patterns of Chinese characters.
  - Add more known pattern exceptions of Chinese characters.
  - Apply ~word~ opcode to 倔 and 据.
  - Change dot pattern of ＆ to 456-12346.
- ~de-de-comp8.ctb~ now has definitions for musical Unicode characters
  thanks to Daniel Mayr
- Emphasis improvements in Unified French 6 dots Braille thanks to
  Ludovic Oger.
- Improvements to Unified English braille, Grade 2 thanks to James
  Datray from Freedom Scientific.
- Numerous back-translation fixes to Grade 2 of UK English and Unified
  English Braille thanks to Anthony Tibbs.

  can be used in translation rules, thanks to Bert Frees.
- Remove some code duplication in ~pattern.c~ thanks to Bert Frees
- It is now also possible to define inline tables when a display table
  has been defined thanks to Bert Frees
- Nightly snapshots of liblouis are now also built for win64 thanks to
  Bert Frees

** Deprecation notice
None

** Backwards incompatible changes
None

** New, renamed or removed tables

*** Renamed
- chardefs.cti -> en-chardefs.cti

*** Removed
- en-us-compbrl.ctb

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.9.0 (2019-03-04)
This release has seen a tremendous amount of work by Bert Frees. He
was instrumental in pushing the improvements for Latvian, Norwegian
and Slovenian. But most prominently he pushed the big change for space
and control character handling through the door. These characters are
now no longer hard coded in liblouis. This should solve a few long
standing issues. Other than that there is the usual assortment of code
improvements and cleanups.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/19?closed=1][the list of closed
issues]].

** New features
- None

** Bug fixes
- Fix a problem in the callback registration in the Python bindings
  thanks to Leonard de Ruijter.
- Fixed memory leaks created by block scope compound literals thanks
  to Martin Gieseking.
- The hard coded rules dealing with white space have been replaced
  with a normal table that is included in all tables. This fixes a
  number of bugs to do with space and control characters. This (big)
  change has been brewing for a couple of releases and has finally
  landed. Thanks to Christian Egli and Bert Frees.

** Braille table improvements
- Major extension of the German 8 dot computer braille table thanks to
  Ali-Riza Ciftcioglu. For example the Euro sign or quote characters
  are finally defined.
- Fix a few issues with Hungarian grade1 and grade2 Braille thanks to
  Attila Hammer.
- Various improvements to Norwegian thanks to Lars Bjørndal, Jostein
  Austvik Jacobsen, Ammar Usama and Bert Frees.
- Updates to Bopomofo-based Chinese Braille thanks to Sponge Jhan:
  Improved Braille representation of Chinese characters, and rewritten
  Kana rules using multipass statements.
- Implement the new Slovenian Braille standard thanks to Robert Merič
  and Bert Frees.
- Updates to Latvian Grade 1 Braille thanks to Artis Raugulis and Bert
  Frees.
- Fixes to English, U.S. Grade 2 (ABAE) thanks to jdatray.

** Other changes
- Don't search for tables in ~/usr/local/share/liblouis/tables~ (or
  the Windows equivalent) if ~LOUIS_TABLEPATH~ is set.
- The log levels in ~liblouis.h~ are no longer exposed as ~LOG_FOO~
  but instead are now prefixed. So ~LOG_WARN~ becomes ~LOU_LOG_WARN~
  for example to issue a warning from a C program using liblouis. The
  actual values remain the same, so the ABI remains stable.

** Deprecation notice
- The ~locale~ opcode was never implemented and was just silently
  ignored. It is now removed from the tables and a warning will be
  issued if it is found in a table.

** Backwards incompatible changes

** New, renamed or removed tables
*** New
- None

*** Renamed
- spaces.ctb -> spaces.uti

*** Removed
- None

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.8.0 (2018-12-03)
The major focus of this release is on braille table updates. There are
major updates to German, Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, Dutch, Czech,
Latvian, Spanish and Ethiopic. Some of these new tables have only been
possible because Bert Frees fixed some nasty long standing bugs behind
the scene. Also there is the usual assortment of code improvements and
cleanups.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/18?closed=1][the list of closed
issues]].

  System der deutschen Brailleschrift/ (2018). They are much smaller
  now as they are based on ~lou_maketable~. As they now work for any
  locale (be it Switzerland or Germany) they have been merged into one
  set of tables for the different grades. Thanks to Christian
  Waldvogel.

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.7.0 (2018-09-03)
This release implements major improvements for back-translation thanks
to concerted efforts by Bue Vester-Andersen, Bert Frees, Timothy Lee
and others. In particular the input/output positions are now correct
also for back-translation. There are new and improved Chinese Braille
tables and some long awaited improvements to UEB. The release also has
some code cleanups and documentation improvements.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/17?closed=1][the list of closed
issues]].

** New features
- Added a new opcode ~midendnumericmodechars~. Characters defined with
  this opcode can appear in the middle or at the end of a number
  without canceling numeric mode. Thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.

** Bug fixes
- Fix another stack-based buffer overflow in input parsing reported by
  Henri Salo thanks to Christian Egli.
- Fix input/output positions for back-translation. Thanks to excellent
  bug reports and patches by Timothy Lee, Bert Frees heroically sat down and
  reworked the handling of the input/output positions for
  back-translation. This solves numerous issues with backward
  translation.
- The returned ~inlen~ and ~outlen~ now always match thanks to the
  above work on input/output positions by Bert Frees.
- Major improvements in the back-translation of capitalized words
  (~capsword~) in conjunction with punctuation and numbers. Thanks to
  Bue Vester-Andersen
- Fixed a problem in the back-translation of numbers in conjunction
  with punctuation and letters. Thanks to Rimas Kudelis and Bue
  Vester-Andersen
- Fix a buffer overflow in ~matchCurrentInput~. Thanks to Hongxu Chen
  for reporting and to Christian Egli for fixing it.

** Braille table improvements
- Danish grade 2 tables: Reduced hyphenation to only the hyphens
  necessary for correct Braille translation. Replaced the longer rules
  with hyphenation for better cursor positioning. Corrected some words.
  Thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.
- New Chinese Mandarin Braille Codes (Grade 1) and (Grade 2) thanks to
  Sunian Loomee. The first one is for Chinese Common Braille, commonly
  known as the old Braille where a Chinese character is composed of
  three Braille Symbols, consonants, vowels and tones. The second
  table is for Chinese double spelling Braille, commonly known as the
  new Braille where Chinese character is composed of two Braille
  Symbols, consonants and vowels, ( the tones are included in vowels ).
- Major update to the Urdu tables thanks to Jake Kyle.
- Back-translation of numbers in Latvian, Polish, Portuguese, Serbian,
  and Swedish has been fixed thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.
- Improvements to UEB such as handling of /BLT/, /BLVD/ and /LLC/,
  number sign placement, final-letter groupsign usage and final-letter
  back-translation thanks to Mike Gray.
- Significant changes to Bopomofo-based Chinese Braille. Among other
  things there is now complete the support of /CJK Unified Ideographs
  Extension A/ and some symbols were added for Nemeth. Thanks to
  Sponge Jhan and 黃偉豪. With this change we can now properly handle
  duoyinzi, Chinese words that have more than one pronunciation. The
  granularity of the cursor movement can now reflect positions of all
  Chinese characters.

** Other changes
- Added documentation of opcodes which were previously introduced as
  part of the UEB work. Thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen.
- Test suite improvements: In addition to checking the translation the
  tests now also check if the provided ~inlen~ is the same as the
  returned ~inlen~ and retry the test with a larger output buffer.
- Fix a problem in the Makefiles that prevented liblouis from being
  built with automake 1.16. This is fixed now thanks to a patch from
  Samuel Thibault.
- Removal of the code for the /scripting language/ for multipass
  opcodes. This code was originally introduced in 2012 but never
  documented. Consequently it was never used. Meanwhile the original
  code for multipass opcodes was much improved. So there is no more
  need for this (duplicate) code and we are removing it.
- The nightly snapshots of pre-built windows binaries are now built
  with UCS4 enabled.

** Deprecation notice
- None

** Backwards incompatible changes
- None

- ukmaths_edit.ctb
- wiskunde-translation.cti
- wiskunde.ctb

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.6.0 (2018-06-04)
This release contains the usual assortment of braille table
improvements, cleanups and bug fixes. The most prominent change is the
refactoring of the call APIs by Bert Frees that makes the code much
more manageable and solid and will help us in the future to evolve the
library.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/16?closed=1][the list of closed
issues]].

** New features
- Add metadata fields =name= and =display-name= to tables thanks to
  Bert Frees. The =name= contains a description of the table in the
  native language. =display-name= contains an English description.
- YAML test enhancements
  - You can now test both forward and backwards translation with in
    the same YAML file and for the same set of tables tests thanks to
    Bue Vester-Andersen. See the documentation for the
    ~bothDirections~ testmode.
  - Add =maxOutputLength= option in YAML tests.

** Bug fixes
- Fix a bunch of buffer overflow errors in table parsing thanks to
  Samuel Thibault and Christian Egli (CVE-2018-11410 and
  CVE-2018-11440).
- Fix input-output mapping of context rules thanks to Bert Frees.
- Fix back tracking with all caps words thanks to Bert Frees.
- Fix context rules with lookback thanks to Bert Frees.
- Fix a memory leak in default table resolver thanks to Timothy Lee.
- Fix an array out of bounds error which caused a crash on i386 thanks
  to Samuel Thibault.
- Fix numerous stack-based buffer overflow in table parsing reported
  by Henri Salo and Edward-L thanks to Christian Egli (CVE-2018-11577,
  CVE-2018-11683, CVE-2018-11684 and CVE-2018-11685).

** Braille table improvements
- Fix some forward- and back-translation errors in Unified French Grade
  2 thanks to André-Abush Clause.
- Updates to the Simplified-Chinese Braille Translation Table thanks
  to Roshanson
  - Added many polygraphs to distinguish different meanings of a word
  - Letter identifiers have been modified. In China's school for the
    blind, when many visually impaired students learn, the lowercase
    letters often do not have to mark the identifiers deliberately. So
    in this version, we this item has been deleted.
  - Fixed a bug in the braille code that revises the space and 0
- Updates to Bopomofo-based Chinese Braille Table thanks to Bo-Cheng Jhan
  - Redefine some Chinese words and phrases
  - Add various Nemeth symbols such as arrows and parenthesis
  - Complete the support of CJK Compatibility block
  - Fix the support of various parentheses, brackets, and braces
  - Minor fixes (kana rules, punctuation marks, Greek alphabets)

    in a struct =EmphasisClass=
  - Simplify input/output buffer handling
  - Combine =emphasisBuffer= and =transnoteBuffer=
  - Group match related vars in a struct =PassRuleMatch=
  - Remove dead code
- Fixed many warnings thanks to Christian Egli

** Deprecation notice
- The =mode= parameter in =lou_dotsToChar= never had any effect and is
  now deprecated.
- In 2012 a new way to specify the test and action part in context and
  multipass opcodes was introduced. It was never documented and has no
  known usage in the wild. However it opens up the attack surface to
  the table parsing code. Therefore it is deprecated and will be
  removed in the next release.

** Backwards incompatible changes
- None

** New, renamed or removed tables
*** New
- cs-comp8.utb
*** Renamed
- None
*** Removed
- Cz-Cz-g1.utb

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.5.0 (2018-03-05)
This release has a number of Braille table improvements, cleanups and
meta data enhancements. The most prominent new feature however is
probably the much improved test coverage. This has helped in tracing
and fixing a number of long standing bugs.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/15?closed=1][the list of closed
issues]].

** New features
- The same name can now be used in more than one ~class~ rule. The
  effect is that both set of characters become part of that one class.

** Bug fixes
- Fix a regression in inputPositions thanks to Bert Frees
- Treat characters within the range ~compbrlStart~ and ~compbrlEnd~ as
  a special case. This fixes many if not most of the problems with
  cursor position and the ~compbrlAtCursor~ mode. Thanks to Dave Mielke.
- Fix ~swapdd~ opcode thanks to Bert Frees
- Fix negation of attribute matcher in multipass expressions thanks to
  Bert Frees

** Braille table improvements
- Add a display table that maps braille dots to brl/brf character set.
  For an in depth explanation see the corresponding [[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/issues/503][github issue]].
  Thanks to Rimas Kudelis
- Major Improvements to Unified French Grade 2 thanks to André-Abush
  Clause
- Fix braille number input for Greek Braille thanks to Dave Mielke
- Add a fix for "phad" according to UEB Rule 10.7.3 thanks to Anthony
  Tibbs
- Updates to the Urdu tables thanks to Jake Kyle from Compass Braille
- Updates to the Chinese braille table (~zh-tw.ctb~) thanks to
  Bo-Cheng Jhan
- ~IPA.utb~ now contains a more complete list of phonetic symbols,
  including some that might conflict with other tables. For this
  reason it is not suitable for inclusion in other tables. A separate
  table ~IPA-unicode-range.uti~ has been added for this
  purpose. Thanks to Ludovic Oger.
- The Mongolian table has been improved and there is now also support
  for grade 2 thanks to Tsengel Maidar.
- Minor updates to the Danish tables thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen
- Fix back translation of numbers in Dutch, Finnish and Canadian
  French, thanks to Leonard de Ruijter.
- New table for Ukrainian thanks to Sergiy Moskalets.

** Other changes
*** Improved documentation
- Extend the documentation on multipass opcodes. Thanks to Dave Mielke
  and Christian Egli.
- Remove the deprecation note of the '=' dots operand. While there are
  still problems with back-translation we will not remove support for
  it. See also the discussion in the [[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/issues/500][github issue]].

*** Improved meta data information in tables
The meta data in the tables such as locale, contraction grade, etc has
been improved and is now also used when testing from a YAML test.
Thanks to Bert Frees.

*** Major overhaul of the YAML test suite
**** Support for proper testing of cursor positions
Due to problems in the cursor position computation the YAML test
suite was improved to support proper testing of cursor position also
in combination with input, output position and modes. In essence all
of the liblouis API is now supported and can be tested via the YAML
tests. Thanks to Christian Egli.

**** Support for table selection via meta data query
The tables to be tested can now be specified via a meta data query in
addition to specifying them by filename. See the documentation for
more details. Internally the YAML tests have been split up into tests
that test the braille translation for a particular locale (now located
in ~tests/braille_specs~) and tests that check a specific feature of
liblouis. Thanks to Bert Frees.

** Deprecation notice
None

** Backwards incompatible changes
- The translation mode ~comp8Dots~ has been removed as it was never
  really implemented anyway
- Support for the ~pass1Only~ flag has now been removed. Thanks to Bue
  Vester-Andersen.
- The old UEB tables ~UEBC-g1.ctb~ and ~UEBC-g2.ctb~ have been removed
  as the have been superseded by ~en-ueb-g1.ctb~ and ~en-ueb-g2.ctb~.
- The french tables ~fr-2007.ctb~, ~fr-fr-g1.utb~, ~fr-fr-g2.ctb~,
  ~fr-ca-g1.utb~ and ~fr-ca-g2.ctb~ have been removed. Use
  ~fr-bfu-comp6.utb~ for 6 dots literary, ~fr-bfu-comp8.utb~ for 8
  dots computer and ~fr-bfu-g2.ctb~ for contracted braille instead.

** New, renamed or removed tables

- UEBC-g2.ctb

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.4.0 (2017-12-04)
This release brings together a lot of work by lots of different
people. Probably the most prominent fix is the work on output
positions by Bue and Bert. NVDA should benefit from this. Then there
are new and massively improved tables like the Lithuanian 6-dot table
by Rimas or the improved back-translation for French by Michel and
André-Abush to name just a few. There are too many contributors to
name them here, thanks to them all.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to [[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/milestone/14?closed=1][the list of closed
issues]].

** New features
- Add support for ~inputPos~ and ~outputPos~ checking in
  ~lou_checkyaml~ thanks to Bue Vester-Andersen. See the manual for
  details and examples.
** Bug fixes
- output positions (~outputPos~) are now calculated based on input
  positions (~inputPos~) thanks to Bert Frees. This avoids a whole
  class of bugs that previously plagued the output positions. This fix
  also obviates the need for the ~pass1Only~ flag. See below for the
  deprecation notice.

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.1.0 (2017-03-06)
An influx of new contributors have made sure that liblouis continues
to improve. Back translation has seen major improvements, there are
some additional modes to help screen readers, for many tables meta
data has been added, the Python bindings are more robust, Windows
support has been improved, the YAML test suite has been generalized
and as usual new and improved braille tables have been included. On
the licensing front we managed to get almost all tables re-licensed to
LGPLv2.1+.

** New features
*** Meta data
Most of the translation tables now contain meta data. This makes them
discoverable. Programs can use the lou_findTable function to find a
table based on a query.

*** noUndefinedDots mode
Add a noUndefinedDots mode to disable the output of dot numbers when
back-translating undefined patterns. Thanks to James Teh.

When back translating input from a braille keyboard cell by cell, it is
desirable to output characters as soon as they are produced.
Similarly, when back translating contracted braille, it is desirable to
provide a "guess" to the user of the characters they typed. To achieve
this, liblouis needs to have the ability to produce no text when
indicators (which don't produce a character by themselves) are not
followed by another cell. This works already for indicators liblouis
knows about such as capital sign, number sign, etc., but it does not
work for indicators which are not (and cannot be) specifically defined
as indicators. For example, in UEB, dots 4 5 6 alone produces the text
"\456/". Setting the noUndefinedDots mode suppresses this dot number
output.

*** partialTrans mode
Add a partialTrans mode to specify that back-translation input should
be treated as an incomplete word. Thanks to James Teh.
  
If this mode is set, rules that apply only for complete words or at
the end of a word will not take effect. This is intended to be used
when translating input typed on a braille keyboard to provide a rough
idea to the user of the characters they are typing before the word is
complete.

*** YAML test framework
The YAML framework has been extended and is much more useful now. You
can test multiple tables within one YAML file, you can define test
tables directly inline and you can test multiple tables using the same
test data. Refer to the documentation for the details.

If really not wanted the YAML tests can be disabled by specifying
~configure --without-yaml~.

** Bug fixes
- Fixes implicit declaration of 'pattern_check' thanks to  Reiner Dolp
- Fix a stackoverflow crash on applications with smaller stack size.
  Thanks to Victor Montalvão.
- Fix the \v escape sequence. Thanks to Davy Kager.
- The Python bindings now give a helpful error if liblouis has been
  compiled with a different character size than Python. Thanks to Matt
  Wenn.
- Massive bug fixes in multipass rules. Dave Mielke has done a
  tremendous job improving the multipass machinery also in the
  context of back-translation. Where needed nofor/noback has been
  added to the multipass rules.

** Other changes
- Improvements to the Emacs mode for editing liblouis tables thanks to
  Christian Egli
- Documenting lou_charSize thanks to Reiner Dolp
- Support for relative table paths in the tests. This will make sure
  you always know which table a test actually uses.
- Infrastructure to build windows binaries in a Docker container,
  thanks to Bert Frees

** Braille table improvements
- UEB improvements, thanks to Mike Gray

  Oger
- Fixes for the French 6 and 8 dots tables thanks to Michel Such. Some
  errors have been fixed and many Unicode characters have been added.
- Add an extended 8-dot computer braille table for U.S. English thanks
  to Davy Kager. The table is tailored for use on Windows (CP-1252)
  and uses dot patterns from Windows screen readers, but should be
  useful on other platforms too.
- New Greek table that is better than the existing Greek Grade 1
  Braille Table (gr-gr-g1.utb) thanks to Dave Mielke.
- Improved number back-translations on fr-fr-g1 and vi-g1 tables
  thanks to Victor Montalvao.
- New Chinese Braille table for use in the mainland of China thanks to
  Kaifang Bao of RejoinTech.
- The Black Circle character is commonly used for displaying password
  characters. The absence of its definition leads to users not being
  able to know how many characters were typed in such fields. This has
  been improved for many tables thanks to Victor Montalvao.

** License changes
- DocArch has agreed to re-license their tables, so we have 8 more
  tables under the LGPLv2.1+.

** Backwards incompatible changes
- The naming in the YAML test framework has changed slightly from
  `tables:` to `table:`.

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.0.0 (2016-07-14)
This is the biggest release of liblouis in years. The major news are
that we now have proper support for UEB and secondly that liblouis is
now licensed under [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html][LGPLv2.1+]].

In order to support UEB the internals of liblouis have seen a major
rewrite. New Opcodes have been added to support the requirements for
proper UEB for example for emphasis handling or to handle proper
translation of numbers. Changes to the opcodes are described in the
documentation. Some of these changes are not backwards compatible. All
tables that come with liblouis have been migrated. If you have private
tables look at the section on upgrading from previous versions in the
[[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/wiki/Emphasis-Opcodes#upgrade-from-previous-versions][wiki]].

This release also changes the C API. External applications will have
to adapt the way they call liblouis. In particular the typeform
parameter has changed.

The license of the library and most of the tables has been changed to
LGPLv2.1. For a detailed list which tables are still in the process of
migrating the license refer to the [[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/wiki/Licensing-of-liblouis-tables][wiki page about the license change]].

  documentation for more details.
- Add ~lou_checkTable~ and ~lou_getTypeformForEmphClass~ to the C API
  and to the Python bindings
** Bug fixes
- Stop buffer overrun in ~lou_getProgramPath~, and also free memory
  after usage. Thanks to Michael Curran.
** Other changes
- The license of the library and most of the tables has been changed
  to [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html][LGPLv2.1+]].
- Improvements to the test suite:
  - Output is printed to ~stderr~. This helps with locating errors when
    testing with the YAML test suite.
  - typeform is included in output.

  functionality has been superceded by the YAML tests. Please use
  these from now on.
- A number of opcodes to handle emphasis have been renamed.
- The C API regarding the typeform parameter has changed.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.5 (2015-12-1)
This minor release introduces new tables (Mongolian and Norwegian 8
dot) and new features to the tracing tool. But the most exiting news
about this release is probably the fact that 12 developers have
contributed to it, showing how widely used liblouis is and how
actively the development progresses.

** New features
- A DEF file is now generated automatically for the windows builds.
  Thanks to Christian Egli
- lou_trace supports backtranslation now. Thanks to Bert Frees

- Massive improvements to Norwegian, thanks to Lars Bjørndal, Ammar
  Usama and Jostein Austvik Jacobsen. They added a 8 dot table and
  lots of test data.
- Improvements to Hungarian, thanks to Attila Hammer

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.4 (2015-08-31)
This is a minor release in terms of features. But in terms of test
coverage and stability it is a vast improvement over previous versions
of Liblouis. The new YAML based test suite contains more than a
million of validated translations. Every change in Liblouis is tested
against this corpus ensuring the change doesn't break anything.

** New features
- YAML based harness tests. Harness tests can now be written in simple
  YAML notation and they are integrated with the normal `make check`
  command. They can be used for both ucs2 and ucs4 and no Python is
  required. Thanks to Christian Egli.

** Bug fixes
- Use a separate gnulib instance for the library and the tools. Use
  the strndup module to avoid build problems on windows.

  currentInput. This fixes the random behavior with tests where the
  emphasis extends to the end of the input string. Thanks to Christian
  Egli.

** Other changes
- if found use texi2any to build the documentation, thanks to Martin
  Michlmayr.

  Zvonimir Stanecic

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.3 (2015-06-01)
Given the release number you might think this is only a minor release.
However looking at the number of developers who contributed to it and
the number of pull requests and issues that were solved this turns out
to be a very impressive and solid release. Most prominently we have a
new function to discover tables based on meta data in table headers.
Also makeinfo is no longer required to build liblouis. And lastly we
have numerous improvements in Braille tables such as Korean,
Vietnamese and UEB to name just a few.

** New features
- [beta] The new function lou_findTable can be used for table
  discovery based on meta data in table headers. Thanks to Bert Frees.
- The Python API now has a new function to check tables aptly named
  ~checkTable~. Thanks to Davy Kager.

** Bug fixes
- Fixed a problem in resolveTable when using a Java resolver, thanks
  to Bert Frees

** Other changes
- The build dependency on makeinfo is now optional. If it is not
  installed we simply do not build the documentation.

** Braille table improvements
- Improvements to Bengali, Devanagari, Kannada, Gujarati, Malayalam,
  Telugu and Oriya, thanks to Sreeja Param
- Corrections and improvements made to en-GB tables thanks to Paul
  Wood
- Vast restructuring to Korean tables. In 2006 the Institute for Korean
  Braille modified some dots in Korean Braille. Specifically, some
  punctuation dots are now based on English. To accommodate this change
  and to retain the old tables, the Korean table set was revised as
  follows:
  - Added three files: ko-chars, the Korean characters dictionary, and
    rules for g1 and g2.
  - ko-g1 and ko-g2 are now interface files that includes needed
    files.
  - Added three files for Korean Braille 2006 revision along with a
    test harness.
- New table for Polish 8 dot computer braille. Thanks to Karol Pecyna.
- New table for Vietnamese 6 dot. Thanks to Harri Pasanen.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.0 (2014-09-01)
This is the first release by the new maintainer team. A lot of work by
people from across the community contributed to this release. There
are massive additions and updates to the Braille tables (e.g.
Afrikaans, Hebrew, many Indian languages, Korean) and also changes to
the C API to enable call backs for error messages and warnings.

** New features
*** New Braille tables
- Tables for Afrikaans, Cherokee, Hawaiian, Maori, Sotho and Tswana
  were donated by Greg Kearney. Afrikaans, Cherokee, Maori and Hawaiian
  all are grade 1 tables and with the exception of Cherokee were
  derived from World Braille Usage 2013. The Cherokee was taken from
  the specification published at www.cbtbc.org/cherokee/.
*** Logging callback
There is now a callback system in place to get error messages and
warnings. This can be used from programs that use liblouis to log
warnings for example.

** Bug fixes
- fix back translation problems when word gets split in unusual places
  causing back translation of whole words for example K5 back
  translates to Knowledgeen, M>k back translates to Moreark, and M5
  back translates to Moren.  This caused over 8400 extra back
  translation errors in en-us-g2 and 5000 in en-ueb-g2. Thanks to Ken
  Perry.
- Fixed bug to prevent removal of \xffff between largesign rules. This
  solves a Liblouisutdml bug where \xffff is used as a segment
  delimiter.
- Fixed a bug in back translation, when a letsign was encountered, the
  letsign was being applied beyond the element it applied to.
- Fix memory leaks in the default table resolver introduced in the
  previous release.
- Fixes to the build system by Simon Aittamaa

** Braille table improvements
- Major improvements to Indian tables thanks to the Indian National
  Institute for Visually Handicapped, in particular Dipendra Manocha,
  Mesar Hameed, Dinesh Kaushall and Sreeja Parameswaran:
  - Corrected opcodes for letters, punctuation marks, digits, signs
    etc.
  - Updated braille codes according to prescribed braille codes for
    each Unicode character by the Braille Council of India for all
    Indian languages.
  - defined rules for dealing with Nukhta character in Hindi table
  - defined rule to insert dot-1 between consonant followed by full
    vowel character in all Indian Languages
  - defined rules for shifting of halant character before the
    consonant. This character is placed after the consonant in normal
    typing but need to be before the consonant in braille. This rule
    is applicable for all Indian languages.
  - defined rules for two conjunct characters "ksha and gya" used in
    all Indian Languages for which there are specific codes in
    Braille.
- New Hebrew table that is based on the new unified Hebrew Braille
  code standard that was put together on January 2014 after a
  conference with all of the specialists in this field in Israel. It
  includes improved representation of Hebrew letters, special letters
  that are called Nikud, and punctuation symbols. The old Braille
  standard is not relevant any more. Thanks to Adi Kushnir.

   - Fix several buffer over/under runs in
     lou_translateString.c:hyphenate.
   - Fix the '=' problem, i.e. fix inputPositions calculation for the

     problem and providing a patch.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.2 (2012-12-18)

While initially planned as mainly a bug fix release this release
contains some notable new features: There is a new tool to trace which
rules have been used to perform a translation. Also along with other
new tables the long awaited table for UEB is finally here.

** New features
*** New tool to trace rule application
    There is a new tool (lou_trace) which helps to trace which rules
    have been used to perform a Braille translation. This is helpful
    for writing Braille tables. See the documentation for more
    information.
*** New Braille tables
    - Inuktitut grade 1, thanks to Greg Kearney.
    - UEB grade 1 and 2, thanks to Joseph Lee. These tables replace
      the old UEB tables (UEBC-g1.utb and UEBC-g2.ctb).

  output characters.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.0 (2012-9-10)

This release contains a tremendous amount of work many developers.
Many long standing bugs have been fixed. The tables can finally be in
UTF-8. A grand table cleanup removed duplication from the tables.
There are now two extensive test frameworks for table writers. A
number of new tables have been contributed on top of the usual
assortment of table improvements. Thanks to all of this liblouis has
already seen quite a bit of uptake in a number of places, notably the
new DAISY pipeline will ship with this release of liblouis.

NOTE: If you have private tables you might want to migrate them to
utf-8. To do this just use iconv as follows:

  $ iconv -f latin-1 -t utf-8 <input >output

** New features
*** New Braille tables
    - Estonian grade 0, thanks to Jürgen Dengo.
    - Portuguese 8 dot Computer braille, Thanks to Rui Fontes
*** UTF-8 support in tables
    Braille tables can now contain UTF-8 in the opcode arguments.
*** Improvements to the python bindings
    All constants defined in liblouis.h are now exposed in the bindings.
*** Add a doctest infrastructure
    These tests are based on the Python doctest framework and are only
    run if there is a Python interpreter on the system
*** Add a test harness
    This test infrastructure allows the user to do table tests in a
    simple and concise syntax. These tests are based on the Python
    nose testing framework and are only run if either Python 2.x or
    3.x with the related nose python module is installed on the
    system. See the documentation for more information. Thanks to
    Mesar Hameed.
*** Add a test harness generator
    A harness generator that uses simple text files with a little
    formatting to help to generate the json harness files. The purpose
    of this tool is to make it much easier and faster to add checks
    for a given table. You are expected to read the generated harness
    file and make necessary changes, the tool only helps you to get
    the tests into the harness format, not check their validity.
*** Support for Python 3 in the Python bindings
    The Python bindings now work for both Python 2 and Python 3.
    Thanks to Michael Whapples.

** Improved C-based test framework
   - Improved the test framework to be able to test translations
     involving Unicode.
   - Added numerous tests, e.g. for lowercase and Unicode, for the
     input position, for repeated, etc.

** Improved the documentation
   - Document the test harness (json format, fields, flags).
   - Document the use of Valgrind to find memory leaks
   - Improve the documentation on the display opcode

** Bug fixes
   - lou_allround and lou_translate now properly handle Unicode
     characters
   - Fix some issues reported by Valgrind
   - Fix inputPos for situation where context and multipass opcodes
     are involved
   - Fixed a number of bugs with the letter, uppercase and lowercase
     opcodes when dealing with Unicode
   - Fixed a couple of bugs with hyphenation (documentation, Python
     bindings and a number of buffer overruns in the C library).
     Thanks Milan Zamazal <pdm@brailcom.org> for reporting this.
   - Fix a bug in the $a. matcher in the multipass rules where only 32
     chars were matched. It now matches 0xffff chars.
   - Fix a bug reported by James Teh related to pass1Only

** Braille Table Improvements
   - all table files have consistent encoding, UTF-8.
   - The grand table cleanup: Reorganize the tables to remove
     duplication. Move common parts such as Latin letter, eight and
     six dot digit definitions to separate files which are then
     included. This should ease table maintenance. Thanks to Mesar Hameed. 
   - Fixes to de-de-comp8.ctb thanks to Aliminator83@gmail.com
