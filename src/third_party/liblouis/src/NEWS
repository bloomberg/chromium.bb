* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.0 (2014-9-1)
This is the first release by the new maintainer team. A lot of work by
people from across the community contributed to this release. There
are massive additions and updates to the Braille tables (e.g.
Afrikaans, Hebrew, many Indian languages, Korean) and also changes to
the C API to enable call backs for error messages and warnings.

** New features
*** New Braille tables
- Tables for Afrikaans, Cherokee, Hawaiian, Maori, Sotho and Tswana
  were donated by Greg Kearney. Afrikaans, Cherokee, Maori and Hawaiian
  all are grade 1 tables and with the exception of Cherokee were
  derived from World Braille Usage 2013. The Cherokee was taken from
  the specification published at www.cbtbc.org/cherokee/.
*** Logging callback
There is now a callback system in place to get error messages and
warnings. This can be used from programs that use liblouis to log
warnings for example.

** Bug fixes
- fix back translation problems when word gets split in unusual places
  causing back translation of whole words for example K5 back
  translates to Knowledgeen, M>k back translates to Moreark, and M5
  back translates to Moren.  This caused over 8400 extra back
  translation errors in en-us-g2 and 5000 in en-ueb-g2. Thanks to Ken
  Perry.
- Fixed bug to prevent removal of \xffff between largesign rules. This
  solves a Liblouisutdml bug where \xffff is used as a segment
  delimiter.
- Fixed a bug in back translation, when a letsign was encountered, the
  letsign was being applied beyond the element it applied to.
- Fix memory leaks in the default table resolver introduced in the
  previous release.
- Fixes to the build system by Simon Aittamaa

** Braille table improvements
- Major improvements to Indian tables thanks to the Indian National
  Institute for Visually Handicapped, in particular Dipendra Manocha,
  Mesar Hameed, Dinesh Kaushall and Sreeja Parameswaran:
  - Corrected opcodes for letters, punctuation marks, digits, signs
    etc.
  - Updated braille codes according to prescribed braille codes for
    each Unicode character by the Braille Council of India for all
    Indian languages.
  - defined rules for dealing with Nukhta character in Hindi table
  - defined rule to insert dot-1 between consonant followed by full
    vowel character in all Indian Languages
  - defined rules for shifting of halant character before the
    consonant. This character is placed after the consonant in normal
    typing but need to be before the consonant in braille. This rule
    is applicable for all Indian languages.
  - defined rules for two conjunct characters "ksha and gya" used in
    all Indian Languages for which there are specific codes in
    Braille.
- New Hebrew table that is based on the new unified Hebrew Braille
  code standard that was put together on January 2014 after a
  conference with all of the specialists in this field in Israel. It
  includes improved representation of Hebrew letters, special letters
  that are called Nikud, and punctuation symbols. The old Braille
  standard is not relevant any more. Thanks to Adi Kushnir.
- UEB table fixes: Fix ity contraction, fixed the missing end word
  contraction ;n ;d sign 46. thanks to Ken Perry.
- Fix for Norwegian where letsign is affecting some extra characters
  thanks to Lars Bjørndal
- Much improved hyphenation for Norwegian thanks to Lars Bjørndal
- Korean Grade 2 now includes support for reading English text using
  grade 2.
- en-us-g1.ctb and en-ueb.g1.ctb are now able to display 8 dot Unicode
  braille.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.4 (2014-3-3)
This release contains nine months worth of braille table improvements
for example for Danish, UEB, en-us, Nemeth, Bulgarian, Slovenian and
many more. Also there are fixes to the core for table path resolving
and back-translation.

** New features

     resolver callback from your host language.

** Bug fixes
   - Fixed ENDSEGMENT indicator in computer Braille thanks to John
     Boyer.

     John Boyer.
   - Fixed several problems with back-translation. A slash within a
     number and strings such as 5-inch-diameter and 25-year-old-man
     should now back-translate correctly. Thanks to John Boyer.
   - Fixed a problem with syllable opcode. Thanks to John Boyer.
   - Fix warnings with gcc 4.8.2. Thanks to Peter Lundblad.
   - When a table is specified with an absolute or relative path, the
     "includes" in that table will now work as expected, meaning files
     in the same directory will be found.

*** runHarness.py: 
    Accept filename globs on the commandline to run specific harness files.
    In tests/harness, one can do make <filename> or make runall
    Removed from make check because these checks are checking the validity
    of our tables, rather than validity of the code.

** Braille Table Improvements
   - da-dk-g2.ctb, mostly rewritten to use nocross and hyphenation
     table.
   - Most tables: removed the default collapse whitespace statements,
     if you need to compress whitespace, consider adding compress.ctb
     to the list of tables when processing.
   - Corrections to Unified English Braille Code (Grade 1 and 2),
     thanks to Joseph Lee
   - Corrections to apostrophes in the Computer Spanish 8 dots Braille

     bugs.
   - Fix nocross opcode processing.
   - Fix several buffer over/under runs in
     lou_translateString.c:hyphenate.
   - Fix the '=' problem, i.e. fix inputPositions calculation for the
     case where the equals sign is used as the dots operand. Thanks to
     Bert Frees
   - Fix a bug when resizing a table. Previously not all references to
     this table were updated.

** Backwards incompatible changes
   - The feature that allowed a mapping between language code and

     bug, was never documented and probably never used. Thanks to
     Peter Nilsson Lundblad and Jeremy Roman for analyzing this
     problem and providing a patch.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.2 (2012-12-18)

While initially planned as mainly a bug fix release this release
contains some notable new features: There is a new tool to trace which
rules have been used to perform a translation. Also along with other
new tables the long awaited table for UEB is finally here.

** New features
*** New tool to trace rule application
    There is a new tool (lou_trace) which helps to trace which rules
    have been used to perform a Braille translation. This is helpful
    for writing Braille tables. See the documentation for more
    information.
*** New Braille tables
    - Inuktitut grade 1, thanks to Greg Kearney.
    - UEB grade 1 and 2, thanks to Joseph Lee. These tables replace

  output characters.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.0 (2012-9-10)

This release contains a tremendous amount of work many developers.
Many long standing bugs have been fixed. The tables can finally be in
UTF-8. A grand table cleanup removed duplication from the tables.
There are now two extensive test frameworks for table writers. A
number of new tables have been contributed on top of the usual
assortment of table improvements. Thanks to all of this liblouis has
already seen quite a bit of uptake in a number of places, notably the
new DAISY pipeline will ship with this release of liblouis.

NOTE: If you have private tables you might want to migrate them to
utf-8. To do this just use iconv as follows:

  $ iconv -f latin-1 -t utf-8 <input >output

** New features
*** New Braille tables
    - Estonian grade 0, thanks to Jürgen Dengo.
    - Portuguese 8 dot Computer braille, Thanks to Rui Fontes
*** UTF-8 support in tables
    Braille tables can now contain UTF-8 in the opcode arguments.
*** Improvements to the python bindings
    All constants defined in liblouis.h are now exposed in the bindings.
*** Add a doctest infrastructure
    These tests are based on the Python doctest framework and are only
    run if there is a Python interpreter on the system
*** Add a test harness
    This test infrastructure allows the user to do table tests in a
    simple and concise syntax. These tests are based on the Python
    nose testing framework and are only run if either Python 2.x or
    3.x with the related nose python module is installed on the
    system. See the documentation for more information. Thanks to
    Mesar Hameed.
*** Add a test harness generator
    A harness generator that uses simple text files with a little
    formatting to help to generate the json harness files. The purpose
    of this tool is to make it much easier and faster to add checks
    for a given table. You are expected to read the generated harness
    file and make necessary changes, the tool only helps you to get
    the tests into the harness format, not check their validity.
*** Support for Python 3 in the Python bindings
    The Python bindings now work for both Python 2 and Python 3.
    Thanks to Michael Whapples.

** Improved C-based test framework
   - Improved the test framework to be able to test translations
     involving Unicode.

     input position, for repeated, etc.

** Improved the documentation
   - Document the test harness (json format, fields, flags).
   - Document the use of Valgrind to find memory leaks
   - Improve the documentation on the display opcode

** Bug fixes
   - lou_allround and lou_translate now properly handle Unicode
     characters
   - Fix some issues reported by Valgrind
   - Fix inputPos for situation where context and multipass opcodes
     are involved
   - Fixed a number of bugs with the letter, uppercase and lowercase
     opcodes when dealing with Unicode
   - Fixed a couple of bugs with hyphenation (documentation, Python
     bindings and a number of buffer overruns in the C library).
     Thanks Milan Zamazal <pdm@brailcom.org> for reporting this.
   - Fix a bug in the $a. matcher in the multipass rules where only 32
     chars were matched. It now matches 0xffff chars.
   - Fix a bug reported by James Teh related to pass1Only

** Braille Table Improvements
   - all table files have consistent encoding, UTF-8.
   - The grand table cleanup: Reorganize the tables to remove
     duplication. Move common parts such as Latin letter, eight and
     six dot digit definitions to separate files which are then
     included. This should ease table maintenance. Thanks to Mesar Hameed. 
   - Fixes to de-de-comp8.ctb thanks to Aliminator83@gmail.com
   - hu1.ctb renamed to hu-hu-g1.ctb
   - hu.ctb renamed to hu-hu-comp8.ctb
