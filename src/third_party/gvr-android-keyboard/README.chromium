Description:
Chrome VR dynamically loads the keyboard API packaged as part of the GVR
keyboard APK. This directory includes the header for the API and the resources
needed to dynamically load the implementation. Note that the GVR keyboard isn't
uploaded to a public repository yet.

Local Modifications:
We added a dependency to gvr_types.h in third_party/gvr-android-sdk, which is
needed by gvr_header.h.
