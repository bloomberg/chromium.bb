/**
 * This annotation is used to disable the InsecureCipherMode Error Prone checker after a proper
 * review by ISE. A comment including a tracking bug for the security review should accompany the
 * annotation.
 *
 * <p>A {@link Cipher} object is created using one of the overloads of the
 * {@link Cipher#getInstance()} method. This method takes a specification of the transformer either
 * as a triple "Algorithm/Mode/Padding"  or just "Algorithm", using the provider's default settings.
 * The InsecureCipherMode checker implemented in Error Prone flags all call sites of
 * {@link Cipher#getInstance()}, where either the insecure ECB mode or the provider's default mode
 * is used. This method annotation is used to suppress the Error Prone checker in use cases where an
 * exception has been granted by ISE after proper review. The annotation is BUILD-visibility
 * restricted and every use must be vetted by the ISE team.
 *
 * <p>Example of usage:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * @SuppressInsecureCipherModeCheckerReviewed // Tracking bug for the review: b/...
 * private String decrypt(String[] input) {
 * Cipher aesCipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
 * aesCipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, new SecretKeySpec(rawKeyMaterial, "AES"));
 * // ...
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
