# Overview

Nearby Connections is a high level protocol on top of Bluetooth/WiFi that acts
as a medium-agnostic socket. Devices are able to advertise, scan, and connect
with one another over any shared medium (eg. BT <-> BT).
Once connected, the two devices share a list of all supported mediums and
attempt to upgrade to the one with the highest bandwidth (eg. BT -> WiFi).
The connection is encrypted, reliable, and fully duplex. BYTE, FILE, and STREAM
payloads are all supported and will be chunked & transferred internally and
recombined on the receiving device.
See [Nearby Connections Overview](https://developers.google.com/nearby/connections/overview)
for more information.
