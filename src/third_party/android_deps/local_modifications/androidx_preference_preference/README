This directory contains PreferenceFragmentCompat.java and
PreferenceDialogFragmentCompat.java, copied without changes from the AndroidX
preference library at commit e865a9b. These files contain three changes
(commits 72c0381, beeb6fb, and e865a9b) that we want in Chromium, but are not
yet in an official preference library release.

To pull in these changes, we exclude PreferenceFragmentCompat and
PreferenceDialogFragmentCompat from the androidx_preference_preference library
in CIPD (which is from an official release), and add a dependency from that
library to a prebuilt jar file containing the two classes we want to update.
