This directory contains AndroidX's DialogFragment.java, copied from commit
88c22bfb, with c07daa2 merged in, which removes a problematic
Fragment.getActivity() call.

To pull in these changes, we exclude DialogFragment from the
androidx_fragment_fragment library in CIPD (which is from an official
release), and add a dependency from that library to a prebuilt jar file
containing our customized DialogFragment.java.

Note that this customization can be removed once we start pulling our
AndroidX dependencies from master.
