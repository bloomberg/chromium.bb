Description:
A fork of the WebXR samples to be kept in sync with Chrome and used for testing Chrome.

Local Modifications:

- Forked to provide a stable set of test pages in sync with Chrome.

- Stripped out the media/ directory to minimize the size.

- Adapted samples to work without node compilation

- Added source from https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix (MIT licensed)
  to js/third-party/gl-matrix, including license file and README.chromium.

- Added missing license file and README.chromium for dat.gui

- Removed the version shim, the samples are intended to work specifically
  with the ToT Chrome version.

Instructions:

In order to serve the samples locally, few steps are required:

1. Copy contents of src/chrome/test/data/xr/webxr_samples/media into
   src/third_party/webxr_test_pages/webxr-samples/media

2. Serve files, for example by running
   `python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port number>` in
   src/third_party/webxr_test_pages/webxr-samples

3. If you are having trouble with the python server such as it being unreliable
   serving media like the gltf files, try using "npm serve".
   To install: `sudo npm install -g serve`
   To run: `serve .` in src/third_party/webxr_test_pages/webxr-samples

To publish samples for OT:

1. python make_ot_samples_folder.py webxr-samples <dest-folder>
   That copies just the subset of samples that we want to publish.

2. Serve <dest-folder> locally and make sure everything works.

3. python update_bucket.py --direct-publish-samples-source=<dest-folder> --direct-publish-samples-dest=<bucket-dest-subfolder>
