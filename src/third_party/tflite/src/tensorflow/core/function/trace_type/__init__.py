"""Trace-time type system for tf.function (TraceType).

Trace-time types describe things like tf.function signatures and type
constraints in some ops.

This module provides utilities and concrete tf.types.experimental.TraceType
definitions for common Python types like containers, along with a generic
implementation for Python objects.
See also: tf.types.experimental.TraceType

Other implementations of TraceType include tf.TypeSpec and its subclasses.
