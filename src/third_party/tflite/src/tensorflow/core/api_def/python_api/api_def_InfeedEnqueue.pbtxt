When using `tf.raw_ops.InfeedEnqueue` with TF2 eager execution, you need to
[manually add dependencies](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/Graph#control_dependencies)
for `InfeedEnqueue` to prevent it from being pruned,
because it is not connected to any output nodes by default. For example, you can
add control dependency manually to ensure the execution of each training
iteration is in serial order. As a stateful op, `InfeedEnqueue` is intentionally
excluded from adding control dependencies automatically.
