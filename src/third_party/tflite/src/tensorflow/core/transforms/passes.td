    This pass performs a topological sort of the body of a graph or function.
    The main purpose is readability, as well as potentially faster processing
    of the body by analyses/transformation as it'll ensure that all uses appear
    after the producer (but note that cycles are allowed in TensorFlow graphs).

    Note that some Grappler optimizers are sensitive to the textual order of the
    operations in the graph. This pass is meant to be approximately stable, in
    that the order of operations in the input graph is preserved as much as
    possible so as to not alter the results of these optimizers.

    This pass converts functional TFG control-flow operations to region-based

    Region-based control-flow is a more natural form for performing control-flow
    optimizations, and it intrinsically enables inter-procedural effects in
    those optimizations. Region-based form can be used to perform loop-invariant
    code motion, control-flow sinking, dead-code analysis, etc.

    For example, consider the following conversion of an `If`.

    ```mlir
    func @true(%a: tensor<*xi32>, %b: tensor<*xi32>) -> (tensor<*xi32>) {
      return %a : tensor<*xi32>

    This pass converts region-based TFG control-flow operations to functional
    forms. For example, it converts `IfRegion` and `WhileRegion` to `If` and
    `While`.

    If a control token is implicitly captured in the region but whose defining op
    does not produce a data value, it cannot be converted to an explicit capture.
    Example:

    ```mlir
    %ctl = NoOp [...]
    %Case, %ctl_0 = CaseRegion %branch_index {
      %Thing, %ctl_1 = Thing [%ctl]
    }
    ```

    Because `%ctl` has no associated data value, the control edge cannot be
    propagated into the region body using a block argument.

    However, if `force_control_capture` is set, all region ops are guaranteed to
    be converted to functional ops by inserting a chain `Const` op:

    ```mlir
    %ctl = NoOp [...]
    %unused, %ctl_captured = Const [%ctl]
    %Case, %ctl_0 = CaseRegion %branch_index {
      %Thing, %ctl_1 = Thing [%ctl_captured]

    ```mlir
    %ctl = NoOp [...]
    %unused, %ctl_captured = Const [%ctl]
    %Case, %ctl_0 = Case(%branch_index, %unused)

    ```mlir

    This pass implements control-flow sinking on TFG region-based control-flow
    ops. Singly-executed regions (i.e. regions known to be executed at most
    once) are analyzed for values whose only uses are within the region. If the
    value is produced by a stateless/side-effect free op, the op is moved inside
    the region so that it is not computed along control paths where its result
    is not needed.

    This pass affects all regions of `tfg.IfRegion` and `tfg.CaseRegion` only,
    as their regions are known to be executed at most once.

    Example:

    ```mlir

    The TensorFlow type system, all tensors are treated as unranked and all
    resources are treated as opaque. However, shape and handle information can
    be specified for certain tensors and resources through registered and
    unregistered attributes, e.g. `_output_shapes` and `_handle_data`. TFG's
    type system has a richer type representation; it is more consistent to store
    information about the types in there instead of in attributes. This pass
    uses attributes to refine function argument, function result, and operation
    result types using these attributes. The attributes are dropped, reducing
    the amount of book-keeping that passes need to do.

    Certain ops also have registered attributes that indicate shapes. For
    example, `If`, `Case`, and `While` have an `output_shapes` attribute. These
    attributes are optional in TFG and are dropped by this pass, but they must
    be present on the operation before export.

    For operations, the following attributes are used to refine result shapes
    and then are dropped:
      * `_output_shapes`
      * `output_shapes` (If, Case, While)

    For operations, the following attributes are dropped because they contain
    redundant data.
      * `Tcond` (If)
      * `Tin` (If, Case)
      * `Tout` (If, Case)
      * `T` (While, For)

    For functions:
      * `_input_shapes` is used to refine function argument types

    For function arguments:
      * `_output_shapes` is used to refine function argument types
      * `tfg.handle_data` is used to refine function result types

    For function results:
      * `_output_shapes` is used to refine function result types
      * `tfg.handle_data` is used to refine function result types

    The following function argument attributes are dropped because they contain
    redundant data:
      * `tfg.dtype`

    optional in TFG. These attributes are required for export, and this pass
    will materialize those attributes.

    The TFG exporter also expects the presence of certain `tfg.` attributes.
