  """Enable mixed precision via a graph rewrite.

  Mixed precision is the use of both float32 and float16 data types when
  training a model to improve performance. This is achieved via a graph rewrite
  operation and a loss-scale optimizer.

  Performing arithmetic operations in float16 takes advantage of specialized
  processing units, such as NVIDIA Tensor Cores, for much higher arithmetic
  throughput. However, due to the smaller representable range, performing the
  entire training with float16 can result in gradient underflow, that is, small
  gradient values becoming zeroes. Instead, performing only select arithmetic
  operations in float16 results in higher throughput and decreased training
  time when using compatible hardware accelerators while also reducing memory
  usage, typically without sacrificing model accuracy.

  Note: While the mixed precision rewrite changes the datatype of various
  layers throughout the model, the same accuracy reached in float32 is
  expected. If a `NaN` gradient occurs with dynamic loss scaling, the model
  update for that batch is skipped. In this case, the global step count is not
  incremented, and the `LossScaleOptimizer` attempts to decrease the loss
  scaling value to avoid `NaN` values in subsequent iterations. This approach
  has been shown to achieve the same accuracy as float32 and, in most cases,
  better training throughput.

  Example:

  ```python
  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='softmax'),
  ])

  opt = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD()
  opt = tf.train.experimental.enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite(opt)
  model.compile(loss="mse", optimizer=opt)

  x_train = np.random.random((1024, 64))
  y_train = np.random.random((1024, 64))
  model.fit(x_train, y_train)
  ```

  Calling `enable_mixed_precision_graph_rewrite(opt)` enables the graph rewrite
  operation before computing gradients. The function additionally returns an
  `Optimizer` (`opt`) wrapped with a `LossScaleOptimizer`. This prevents
  underflow in the float16 tensors during the backward pass. An optimizer of
  type `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer` or `tf.compat.v1.train.Optimizer` must be
  passed to this function, which will then be wrapped to use loss scaling.

  The graph rewrite operation changes the dtype of certain operations in the
  graph from float32 to float16. There are several categories of operations
  that are either included or excluded by this rewrite operation. The following
  categories of Ops are defined inside corresponding functions under the class
  `AutoMixedPrecisionLists` in
  <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/
  core/grappler/optimizers/auto_mixed_precision_lists.h">
  auto_mixed_precision_lists.h</a>:

  * `ClearList`: Ops that do not have numerically significant adverse effects.
  E.g. `ArgMax` and `Floor`.
  * `WhiteList`: Ops that are considered numerically safe for execution in
  float16, and thus are always converted. E.g. `Conv2D`.
  * `BlackList`: Ops that are numerically unsafe to execute in float16 and
  can negatively affect downstream nodes. E.g. `Softmax`.
  * `GrayList`: Ops that are considered numerically safe for execution in
  float16 unless downstream from a BlackList Op. E.g. `Add` and `AvgPool`.

  When this function is used, gradients should be computed and applied with the
  returned optimizer, either by calling `opt.minimize()` or
  `opt.compute_gradients()` followed by `opt.apply_gradients()`. If gradients
  are instead computed with `tf.gradients` or `tf.GradientTape`, loss scaling
  will not be applied, which will likely cause your model not to converge due to
  float16 underflow problems. To apply lossing scaling with `tf.gradients` or
  `tf.GradientTape`, `LossScaleOptimizer.get_scaled_loss` and
  `LossScaleOptimizer.get_unscaled_gradients`. See
  `keras.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScaleOptimizer` for details how to do
  this.

  When eager execution is enabled, the mixed precision graph rewrite is only
  enabled within `tf.function`s, as outside `tf.function`s, there is no graph.

  For NVIDIA GPUs with Tensor cores, as a general performance guide, dimensions
  (such as batch size, input size, output size, and channel counts)
  should be powers of two if under 256, or  otherwise divisible by 8 if above
  256. For more information, check out the
  [NVIDIA Deep Learning Performance Guide](
  https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/dl-performance-guide/index.html).

  Currently, mixed precision is only enabled on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs with
  Compute Capability 7.0 and above (Volta, Turing, or newer architectures). The
  parts of the graph on CPUs and TPUs are untouched by the graph rewrite.

  ## Comparison with the Keras mixed precision  API
  Both this function and the [Keras mixed precision
  API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/mixed_precision) enable the use of
  mixed precision in a model. Therefore, only one of the two APIs can be used.
  We recommend using the Keras mixed precision API, as it is more customizable
  and supports Eager execution. However, it only supports models which use Keras
  layers, while the graph rewrite works in any model that uses `tf.function`s.

  The core difference between the two APIs is that this function is a graph
  rewrite, and so it changes the graph to use mixed precision under the hood.
  You still build your graph in float32, and the graph rewrite will change
  certain ops to float16. The Keras mixed precision API directly builds the
  Keras Model using a mix of float16 and float32.

  One core advantage of the Keras API is it supports mixed precision with Eager
  execution, i.e. mixed precision outside `tf.function`s. The graph rewrite will
  only affect ops within `tf.function`s, making it harder to debug if issues
  occur with mixed precision. The Keras API is also more customizable, as you
  can override any layer to run in float32 by passing `dtype="float32"` to the
  layer constructor. Additionally, you can query the dtype of tensors in the
  model by checking `tensor.dtype`. With the graph rewrite, all tensors appear
  to be float32 since the dtype is only changed under the hood.

  The main advantage of the graph rewrite (this function) is that it works even
  if you do not use Keras layers or any other part of Keras. The Keras mixed
  precision API requires models which use Keras layers, as it only inserts casts
  inside Keras layers and models. Another advantage is that the graph rewrite
  never results in a TypeError, which the Keras API may introduce if you do
  certain operations outside Keras. For example, the following will result in a
  TypeError if the Keras mixed precision API is enabled, as a float16 and
  float32 tensor will be added:
  `tf.keras.layers.Dense(2)(x) + tf.keras.layers.Dense(2, dtype="float32")(x)`

  Raises:
    `ValueError`, if the `tf.keras.mixed_precision` API is also used by calling
    `tf.keras.mixed_precision.experimental.set_policy`. Only one mixed precision
    API can be used.

  Args:
    opt: An instance of a `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer`.
    loss_scale: Either an int/float, the string `"dynamic"`, or an instance of a
      `tf.mixed_precision.experimental.LossScale`. The loss scale to use. It is
      recommended to keep this as its default value of `"dynamic"`, which will
      adjust the scaling automatically to prevent `Inf` or `NaN` values.

  Returns:
    A version of `opt` that will use loss scaling to prevent underflow.
