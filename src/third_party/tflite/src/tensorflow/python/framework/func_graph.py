    The `tf.function` supports the notion of captures, that is, it allows Python
    functions to have closure variables, which bind over some value outside the
    function. However, this name binding is "early binding" performed before the
    program is run, i.e.,
    ```
    @tf.function
    def f():
      return x

    x = tf.constant(1)
    f()  # returns 1

    x = tf.constant(2)
    f()  # still returns 1!
    ```
    while in Python, name binding is performed as the program is running.
    ```
    def f():
      return x

    x = 1
    f()  # returns 1

    x = 2
    f()  # returns 2
    ```
    `capture_call_time_value` allows tf.function to mimic late binding as a
    Python function does, by passing in a `closure` callable argument to be
    executed when the tf.function is invoked eagerly.  E.g.
    ```
    @tf.function
    def f():
      return ops.get_default_graph.capture_call_time_value(lambda: x)

    x = tf.constant(1)
    f()  # returns 1

    x = tf.constant(2)
    f()  # returns 2
    ```
    Note that a `capture_call_time_value` function itself does not work well in
    the saving process (since the tf.function in which it's called is not
    invoked eagerly) unless passed a `default_value` argument. At saving time,
    the `default_value` argument is returned instead.

    Args:
      closure: function which takes no arguments, to be evaluated at function
        call time, returning a nest of tensors compatible with `spec`.
      spec: nest of TypeSpec for the value to capture.
      key: optional. If not None, multiple calls to lazy_capture with the same
        key in the same graph will return the same placeholder, and the
        first closure will be used at function call time.
      default_value: optional value to return in environments that cannot safely
        evaluate closure.
      placeholder: optional. If not None, the graph will take the passed-in
        `placeholder` as the internal capture instead of creating a new one.
        This is useful when loading from a SavedModel.

    Returns:
      Nest of placeholders which, at function call time, will be fed with the
      result of calling closure().

    Raises:
      ValueError: at function call time, if the return value of closure() is
       not compatible with `spec`.
