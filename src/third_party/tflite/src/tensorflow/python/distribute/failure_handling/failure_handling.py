  """Preemption and error handler for synchronous training.

  The API helps coordinate all workers to save a checkpoint upon receiving a
  preemption signal and helps propagate accurate error messages during training.
  When the program recovers from preemption, the checkpoint that is passed to
  initialize a `CoordinatedCheckpointManager` object will be loaded
  automatically.

  Right after the initialization, a thread starts to watch out for a preemption
  signal for any member in the cluster, but the signal will only be handled
  (which includes aligning the step to save a checkpoint, saving a checkpoint,
  and exiting with a platform recognized restart code) after entering a
  `CoordinatedCheckpointManager.run` call.

  Example usage:
  ```python
  strategy = tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy()

  with strategy.scope():
    dataset, model, optimizer = ...

    fh_checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(optimizer=optimizer, model=model)

    coordinated_checkpoint_manager = tf.distribute.CoordinatedCheckpointManager(
        cluster_resolver, fh_checkpoint, checkpoint_directory)


    # `coordinated_checkpoint_manager.total_runs` will be restored to its
    # checkpointed value when training is restored after interruption.
    for epoch in range(coordinated_checkpoint_manager.total_runs //
                       STEPS_PER_EPOCH, num_epochs):
      for step in range(coordinated_checkpoint_manager.total_runs %
                        STEPS_PER_EPOCH, num_steps):
        # distributed_train_step is a function wrapped by strategy.run
        loss += coordinated_checkpoint_manager.run(distributed_train_step,
                                                   args=(next(dataset),))
  ```

  `CoordinatedCheckpointManager` will create a CheckpointManager to manage the
  checkpoint and only one CheckpointManager should be active in a particular
  directory at a time. Thus, if the user would like to save a checkpoint for
  purpose other than fault tolerance, e.g., for evaluation, they should save it
  in a directory different from the one passed to a
  `CoordinatedCheckpointManager`.

  This API targets multi-client distributed training, and right now only
  `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` is supported.

    This function handles the preemption signal from any peer in the cluster by
    saving the training progress and exiting gracefully. (Specifically, when
    running on Borg, it exits with a special code so that the cluster
    automatically restarts the training after the down worker is back.) It will
    also propagate any program error encountered during execution of
    `distributed_train_function` to all workers so that they can raise the same
    error.

    The `distributed_train_function` argument should be a distributed train
    function (i.e., containing a call to `tf.distribute.Strategy.run`). For
    `tf.distribute.MultiWorkerMirroredStrategy` users, we recommend passing in a
