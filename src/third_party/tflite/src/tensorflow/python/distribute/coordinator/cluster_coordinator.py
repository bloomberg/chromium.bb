  """An object to schedule and coordinate remote function execution.

  This class is used to create fault-tolerant resources and dispatch functions
  to remote TensorFlow servers.

  Currently, this class is not supported to be used in a standalone manner. It
  should be used in conjunction with a `tf.distribute` strategy that is designed
  to work with it. The `ClusterCoordinator` class currently only works
  `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`.

  __The `schedule`/`join` APIs__

  The most important APIs provided by this class is the `schedule`/`join` pair.
  The `schedule` API is non-blocking in that it queues a `tf.function` and
  returns a `RemoteValue` immediately. The queued functions will be dispatched
  to remote workers in background threads and their `RemoteValue`s will be
  filled asynchronously. Since `schedule` doesn’t require worker assignment, the
  `tf.function` passed in can be executed on any available worker. If the worker
  it is executed on becomes unavailable before its completion, it will be
  migrated to another worker. Because of this fact and function execution is not
  atomic, a function may be executed more than once.

  __Handling Task Failure__

  This class when used with
  `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy`, comes with built-in
  fault tolerance for worker failures. That is, when some workers are not
  available for any reason to be reached from the coordinator, the training
  progress continues to be made with the remaining workers. Upon recovery of a
  failed worker, it will be added for function execution after datasets created
  by `create_per_worker_dataset` are re-built on it.

  When a parameter server fails, a `tf.errors.UnavailableError` is raised by
  `schedule`, `join` or `done`. In this case, in addition to bringing back the
  failed parameter server, users should restart the coordinator so that it
  reconnects to workers and parameter servers, re-creates the variables, and
  loads checkpoints. If the coordinator fails, after the user brings it back,
  the program will automatically connect to workers and parameter servers, and
  continue the progress from a checkpoint.

  It is thus essential that in user's program, a checkpoint file is periodically
  saved, and restored at the start of the program. If an
  `tf.keras.optimizers.Optimizer` is checkpointed, after restoring from a
  checkpoiont, its `iterations` property roughly indicates the number of steps
  that have been made. This can be used to decide how many epochs and steps are
  needed before the training completion.

  See `tf.distribute.experimental.ParameterServerStrategy` docstring for an
  example usage of this API.

  This is currently under development, and the API as well as implementation
  are subject to changes.

    `fetch` can be called on it to wait for the function execution to finish
    and retrieve its output from a remote worker. On the other hand, call
    `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.ClusterCoordinator.join` to wait for
    all scheduled functions to finish.

    `schedule` guarantees that `fn` will be executed on a worker at least once;
    it could be more than once if its corresponding worker fails in the middle
    of its execution. Note that since worker can fail at any point when
    executing the function, it is possible that the function is partially
    executed, but `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.ClusterCoordinator`
    guarantees that in those events, the function will eventually be executed on
    any worker that is available.

    If any previously scheduled function raises an error, `schedule` will raise
    any one of those errors, and clear the errors collected so far. What happens
    here, some of the previously scheduled functions may have not been executed.
    User can call `fetch` on the returned
    `tf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.RemoteValue` to inspect if they have
    executed, failed, or cancelled, and reschedule the corresponding function if
    needed.

    When `schedule` raises, it guarantees that there is no function that is
    still being executed.

    execution, or priority of the workers.
