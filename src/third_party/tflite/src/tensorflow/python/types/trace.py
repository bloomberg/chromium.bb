"""tf.function tracing types.

See `core.GenericFunction` and `core.ConcreteFunction`.

`GenericFunction` assigns types to call arguments, forming a signature.
Function signatures are used to match arguments to `ConcreteFunction`s.
For example, when a new `ConcreteFunction` is traced, it is assigned a
the signature of the arguments it was traced with. Subsequent call arguments
which match its signature will be dispatched to the same `ConcreteFunction`.
If no `ConcreteFunction` with a matching signature is found, a new one may be
traced (a process known as retracing).
