// This optimization pass horizontally fuses computations for reducing kernel
// launch overhead while increasing kernel launch dims on GPU. The initial
// motivation of this horizontal fusion is due to the observation that the
// training optimizer phase (e.g., AdamOptimizer and L2Loss, etc.) typically
// has many small kernels as a result of applying the same formula on many
// training parameters (or variables in Tensorflow). Fusing these small
// kernels, hence, provides performance gain.
//
// Theoretically speaking, we may implement a cycle detection algorithm to make
// sure no cycles are created after fusion. However, cycle detection check is
// somewhat cumbersome; also, we observe that naive horizontal fusion of
// arbitrary kernels may not be profitable due to control divergence and
// possible increase of memory bandwidth pressure due to uncoalesced memory
// accesses (note that horizontal fusion does not change the amount of memory
// read+written at all). In practice, a simple yet effective heuristic is used
// to avoid these issues while addressing the known beneficial cases. That is,
// we simply search for fusion candidates by looking for instructions whose
// outputs are all consumed by the same instruction. This catches the cases in
// the training optimizer phase, as the candidate instructions are typically
// consumed only by the ROOT tuple of the entry computation.
//
// The following illustrates the mechanism of the horizontal fusion. Before
// fusion, there are two trivial kernels in the illustrating example. One has
// only a Mul op, while the other consists of only an Add op. Since they are
// only consumed by the same (ROOT) tuple instruction, horizontal fusion is
// triggered.
//
// i0 i1   i2 i3
//  | |     | |
//  v v     v v
//  Mul     Add
//   |       |
//   v       v
//  (ROOT) tuple
//
// We horizontally fuse them into the below pattern.
//
// i0 i1   i2 i3       +++ (Slice) Input Fusion
//  | |     | |          +
//  v v     v v          +
//  Mul     Add          +
//   |       |           +
//   v       v           +
// Reshape0  Reshape1    +
//   |       |           +
//   v       v           +
//  Concatenate          +
//   |       |           +
//   v       v           +
//  Slice0  Slice1     +++
//   |       |
//   v       v
// Reshape2  Reshape3
//   |       |
//   v       v
//  (ROOT) tuple
//
// Note that this fusion style provides an important advantage that kernels of
// different shapes can be horizontally fused. The first pair of reshapes
// (i.e., Reshape0 and Reshape1) reshape the dims to 1 dimension, so that the
// outputs of the fused kernels can (always) be concatenated. The second pair
// of reshapes (Reshape2 and Reshape3) restore the original shapes to the
// output tensors.
//
// No extra copies are introduced by the horizontal fusion. Besides Reshape2
// and Reshape3, the other instructions are fused into an input fusion; the
// output dims of the concatenate will be used as the kernel launch dims.
// Instruction bitcasts can be used for Reshape2 and Reshape3 as long as the
// outputs of Mul and Add are row-major.
