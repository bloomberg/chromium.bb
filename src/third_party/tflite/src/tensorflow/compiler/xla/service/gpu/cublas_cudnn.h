// Different types of convolutions supported by cudnn.
//
// A way to think about these is that a convolution is defined by three arrays
// -- the "input", the "filter", and the "output" -- and given any two of these,
// we can compute the third.  For example, a backward-input convolution takes as
// input a filter and an "output" and produces an "input" such that if one were
// to do a forward convolution of "input" using filter, the result would be
// something with the same shape as "output".
//
// This way of thinking is not correct if you look at the values produced. For
// example, a backward-input convolution is not actually the mathematical
// inverse of a forward convolution.  But it's right as far as the shapes and
// "connectivity" (i.e. which elements of the input affect which elements of
// the output) are concerned.

// regular convolution ops.  They have the same LHS and RHS operands, plus two
// additional constant operands: an int64_t operand for the cudnn algorithm and
// a bool operand for whether tensor_ops is enabled. A value of -1 for the cudnn
// algorithm means that the implementation is free to choose the best algorithm
// it can.
//
// These calls output a tuple (conv_result, scratch_memory), where conv_result
// is the actual result of the convolution, and scratch_memory is temporary
// memory used by cudnn.  Callers shouldn't inspect scratch_memory, as its value
// is not well-defined.
//

// on in the pipeline, CudnnConvAlgorithmChooser chooses an explicit
// algorithm for each conv and sets the amount of scratch space needed.

// it's quite sensible, from a certain point of view.  The scratch buffer is a
// location in memory that the conv can write into, but which it can't legally
// read from, at least until it's written something first.  But that's exactly
// the definition of an output buffer.)
