We regularly publish security advisories about using TensorFlow.

*Note*: In conjunction with these security advisories, we strongly encourage
TensorFlow users to read and understand TensorFlow's security model as outlined
in
[SECURITY.md](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md).
