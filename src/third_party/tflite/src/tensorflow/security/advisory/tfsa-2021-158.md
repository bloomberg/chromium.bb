## TFSA-2021-158: FPE in TFLite pooling operations

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-37684

### Impact
The implementations of pooling in TFLite are vulnerable to division by 0
errors as there are no checks for divisors not being 0.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
[dfa22b348b70bb89d6d6ec0ff53973bacb4f4695](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/dfa22b348b70bb89d6d6ec0ff53973bacb4f4695).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.5.1, TensorFlow 2.4.3, and TensorFlow 2.3.4, as these are
also affected and still in supported range.
