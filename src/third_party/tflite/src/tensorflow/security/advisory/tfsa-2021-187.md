## TFSA-2021-187: FPE in convolutions with zero size filters

### CVE Number
CVE-2021-41209

### Impact
The [implementations for convolution operators](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/conv_ops.cc) trigger a division by 0 if passed empty filter tensor arguments.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f2c3931113eaafe9ef558faaddd48e00a6606235](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f2c3931113eaafe9ef558faaddd48e00a6606235).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
