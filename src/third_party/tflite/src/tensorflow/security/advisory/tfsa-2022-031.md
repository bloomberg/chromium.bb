## TFSA-2022-031: `CHECK`-fail with repeated `AttrDef`

### CVE Number
CVE-2022-23565

### Impact
An attacker can trigger denial of service via assertion failure by altering a `SavedModel` on disk such that `AttrDef`s of some operation are duplicated.

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c2b31ff2d3151acb230edc3f5b1832d2c713a9e0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c2b31ff2d3151acb230edc3f5b1832d2c713a9e0).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
