        TensorFlow Lite is an open-source deep learning framework to run TensorFlow models
        on-device. If you are new to TensorFlow Lite, we recommend that you first explore the
        <a href="/lite/models">pre-trained models</a> and run the example
        apps below on a real device to see what TensorFlow Lite can do.
