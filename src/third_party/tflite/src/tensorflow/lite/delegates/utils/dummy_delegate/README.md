#Description
A dummy delegate implementation to illustrate

*  How to use [SimpleDelegateInterface and SimpleDelegateKernelInterface](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/utils/simple_delegate.h)
   to faciliate a TFLite delgate creation. A more sophisticated example could be
   refered to the [Flex delegate](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/delegates/flex)

* How to leverage the [delegate registrar](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/lite/tools/delegates)
  to plug in a delegate in TFLite benchmark and task evaluation tools.

More detailed guide is coming soon.
