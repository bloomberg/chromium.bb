// This header file is for the delegate plugin for GPU.
//
// For the C++ delegate plugin interface, the GPU delegate plugin is added to
// the DelegatePluginRegistry by the side effect of a constructor for a static
// object, so there's no public API needed for this plugin, other than the API
// of tflite::delegates::DelegatePluginRegistry, which is declared in
// delegate_registry.h.
//
// But to provide a C API to access the GPU delegate plugin, we do expose
// some functions, which are declared below.
