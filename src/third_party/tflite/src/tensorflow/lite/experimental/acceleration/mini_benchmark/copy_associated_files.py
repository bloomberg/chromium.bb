"""TFLite model associated files copier.

A TFLite model with metadata may have 'associated files': extra data stored as a
zip file appended to the model. This script copies such files from one model to
another. This is used as part of constructing validation models.

See https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/convert/metadata for description of models
with metadata.

If there are no associated files in the provided file, the model is output
as-is.
