// A memory planner that makes all the allocations using arenas.

// Before a model is executed by the interpreter, this class determines when
// each tensor needs to be allocated and deallocated, and preallocates all the
// necessary memory (the PlanAllocations phase). It then assigns portions of
// this memory buffer to each tensor (the ExecuteAllocations phase). Tensors may
// share some of the buffer if a tensor B is to be allocated after another
// tensor A has been deallocated.
//
// If dynamic tensors are used the planning steps can be repeated during model
// execution. Since dynamic tensors don't have sizes until after the
// corresponding operation is executed, this class supports incremental
// planning.
