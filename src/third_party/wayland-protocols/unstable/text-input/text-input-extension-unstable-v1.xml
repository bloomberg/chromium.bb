    <description summary="extends text_input to support richer operations">
      Allows a text_input to sends more variation of operations to support
      richer features, such as set_preedit_region.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding uinterface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.

        index is the starting point of the preedit, relative to the current

        length is the length of the preedit region in utf-8 byte length.

        text_input::preedit_styling sent just before this will be applied.
