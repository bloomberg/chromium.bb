Description:
Turbine is a header compiler for Java. This library does not provide versioning
or maven releases, so we need to pull it in and build it ourselves.

Since we have no working non-android java proto processor, we cannot yet build
it in GN. Thus build it manually and upload to cipd for now.

Commands to update:
- Ensure current working directory is `src/third_party/turbine`
- $ mvn package -DskipTests=true -q -f src/pom.xml
- $ cp -f src/target/turbine-0.1-SNAPSHOT-all-deps.jar turbine.jar
- $ cipd auth-login
- $ cipd create --pkg-def cipd.yaml
- Update `src/DEPS` with the hash id from the cipd create command output.

Local Modifications:
No modifications.
