A standalone WebApp for viewing chrome://net-export
[NetLog](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-stack/netlog) dump files
============

Introduction
------------
This is a WebApp that allows someone to perform post-mortem analysis of a
saved Chromium NetLog dump. The full design doc can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ll7T5cguj5m2DqkUTad5DWRCqtbQ3L1q9FRvTN5-Y28/edit#).


Workflow
--------------
1. Generate a NetLog dump file using chrome://net-export, or download one that
has been generated by someone else. NetLog dump files are platform and
architecture independent.

2. The netlog viewer can be served locally, or accessed through a public server.

  * The public server is located at https://netlog-viewer.appspot.com/.
    (All netlog data is processed locally in your browser, not uploaded to the
    server.)

  * To serve the app locally, clone the catapult repository and serve the files
    from an HTTP localhost server:
    ```
    git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/catapult
    cd catapult/netlog_viewer
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
    ```

    Visit http://localhost:8080/index.html in your web browser to view the
    netlog viewer.


3. Click "Choose File" which will allow you to select the file you
exported earlier. From there your NetLog dump will appear as a table filled
with all the dump's information. Visit the other tabs to view additional
information!


Deploying
------------
1. Run netlog_viewer/bin/run_dev_server_tests and verify that nothing fails.

2. You must be an admin on the netlog-viewer appengine project.

3. Authenticate with the gcloud command line tool. (Only needs to be done once.)
```
gcloud auth login
```

4. Create "static" symlink. (The symlink is not commited to git due to
cross-platform issues.)
```
cd appengine
ln -s ../netlog_viewer static
```

5. Run app server locally, load in browser, and test that everything looks good.
```
dev_appserver.py app.yaml
```

6. Deploy.
```
gcloud app deploy --project netlog-viewer
```


Merge history
------------
The initial code was taken out of Chromium. The code should contain all
changes made to net-internals up to chromium commit
bde2d7652e5b47fc8a2c5e18e932f8ce171a9510, after which the netlog viewer code
was removed from Chromium.
