    <!-- TODO(rayraymond): The use of this URL rather than referencing
    the polymer libary in Catapult is due to the fact that when the app
    is served through GitHub it does not have access to those files
    because it does not make use of Catapult's dev server (which
    normally handles getting these file paths). This is a temporary
    solution for now until the files that are served by GitHub Pages
    change. -->
