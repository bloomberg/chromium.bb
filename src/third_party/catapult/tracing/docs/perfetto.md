[Perfetto](https://perfetto.dev) is an evolution of chrome://tracing. Try it
out!

Our long-term goal is to replace the Catapult trace viewer with Perfetto's UI.
Perfetto offers various advantages, including:

* Support for larger trace sizes and more responsive trace navigation
* Interactive SQL queries to analyze the trace model
* Android system trace recording via WebUSB

So far, the Perfetto UI has been optimized for use cases on Android. If your
Chromium use case could be supported in better ways, or if you're missing a
loved feature from the catapult viewer, please leave us
[feedback](https://perfetto.dev/docs/#bugs).
