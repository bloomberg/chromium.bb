These files are meant to be loaded by the chromez app at
https://chromez-app.appspot.com/.

To load any of these configs, get the raw URL from GitHub and then paste it
into the box on chromez. This will persist the config location in the URL so
you can bookmark/share it.

As an example, to see the review dashboard for Speed Operations, you could use
the URL https://chromez-app.appspot.com/#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catapult-project/catapult/master/experimental/chromez/speed_operations.json .
