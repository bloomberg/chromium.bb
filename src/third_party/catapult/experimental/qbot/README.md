qbot - Simple access to buildbot data
=====================================

This is a python library made to flexibly interact with the [Milo][] and
[LogDog][] services for accessing buildbot data.

To quickly get started place the json keyfile for a service account with access to those services under:

    ~/.default_service_credentials.json

[Milo]: https://luci-milo.appspot.com/
[LogDog]: https://luci-logdog.appspot.com/app/
