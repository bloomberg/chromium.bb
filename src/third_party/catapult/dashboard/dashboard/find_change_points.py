"""A simplified change-point detection algorithm.

Historically, the performance dashboard has used the GASP service for
detection. Brett Schein wrote a simplified version of this algorithm
for the dashboard in Matlab, and this was ported to Python by Dave Tu.

The general goal is to find any increase or decrease which is likely to
represent a real change in the underlying data source.
