## Code Structure

All dashboard code lives in the `dashboard/` subdirectory, with the endpoints
for individual HTTP API handlers in that directory. There are a number of
subprojects which are also hosted in that directory:

-   `api`: Handlers for API endpoints.
-   `common`: A module collecting various utilities and common types used across
    multiple subprojects in the performance dashboard.
-   `docs`: A collection of documents for users of the dashboard, the API, and
    other subprojects.
-   `elements`: User interface elements used in the performance dashboard web
    user interface. This is deprecated in favor of `spa`.
-   `models`: A collection of types which represent entities in the data store,
    with associated business logic for operations. These models should be
    thought of as models in the Model-View-Controller conceptual framework.
-   `pinpoint`: The performance regression bisection implementation. See more in
    the [pinpoint documentation](/dashboard/dashboard/pinpoint/README.md).
-   `services`: A collection of wrappers which represent external services which
    the dashboard subprojects interact with.
-   `static`: Directory containing all the static assets used in the user
    interface. This is deprecated in favor of `spa`.
-   `templates`: HTML files representing the templates for views served through
    the App Engine user interface. This is deprecated in favor of `spa`.
-   `sheriff_config`: A standalone service for managing sheriff configurations
    hosted in git repositories, accessed through luci-config.
