Description:
This package tracks the freetype-testing repository which is a collection of
fuzzer harnesses that provide coverage for freetype for oss-fuzz. We want to run
some of the fuzzing harness as part of Chromium's own fuzzing. This is the
reason for this repository to be included.

How to update:
1. Update the revision in this file, and the freetype-testing revision in the
   top level Chromium DEPS file.
2. Update BUILD.gn to reflect changes if needed.
