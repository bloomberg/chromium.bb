# We expect a bunch of flags coming in from the fuzzing framework;  in fact
# everything that is connected to compilers, sanitizers, coverage, ...  The
# only thing that we want to touch here is setting the correct fuzzer linker
# flags:  CMake has to add `-fsanitizer=fuzzer' or `-lFuzzingEngine' itself
# when building the targets:  `-fsanitizer=fuzzer' adds a `main' function
# which would cause CMake's setup process to fail.  See
# `fuzzing/src/fuzzing/CMakeLists.txt' for details.
