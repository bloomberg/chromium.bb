"""An import entry for the TFLite Support project.

In the original project structure, all python targets are accessed by paths like
tensorflow_lite_support.metadata.metadata.MetadataDisplayer, which is verbose
and deep. This file provides some shortcuts. It's also compatible with our first
version Pip package.

In pip build, this file will be renamed as tflite_support/__init__.py.
