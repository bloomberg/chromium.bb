# Gzip

Gzip ([RFC 1952](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1952.txt)) is a thin wrapper
around raw deflate (RFC 1951). Gzip is similar to zlib (RFC 1950), but with a
different wire format and checksum algorithm.

Gzip is used as an HTTP compression format and as a standalone file format for
the `gzip`, `gunzip` and `zcat` utility programs.

TODO: a worked example.
