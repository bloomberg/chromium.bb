Header-only library for division via fixed-point multiplication by inverse

On modern CPUs and GPUs integer division is several times slower than multiplication. FXdiv implements an algorithm to replace an integer division with a multiplication and two shifts. This algorithm improves performance when an application performs repeated divisions by the same divisor.

## Features

- Integer division for `uint32_t`, `uint64_t`, and `size_t`
- Header-only library, no installation or build required
- Compatible with C99, C++, OpenCL, and CUDA
- Uses platform-specific compiler intrinsics for optimal performance
- Covered with unit tests and microbenchmarks

## Example

```c
#include <fxdiv.h>

/* Division of array by a constant: reference implementation */
void divide_array_c(size_t length, uint32_t array[], uint32_t divisor) {
  for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    array[i] /= divisor;
  }
}

/* Division of array by a constant: implementation with FXdiv */
void divide_array_fxdiv(size_t length, uint32_t array[], uint32_t divisor) {
  const struct fxdiv_divisor_uint32_t precomputed_divisor =
    fxdiv_init_uint32_t(divisor);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++) {
    array[i] = fxdiv_quotient_uint32_t(array[i], precomputed_divisor);
  }
}
```
