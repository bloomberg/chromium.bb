// NSFileManager has improved substantially in Leopard and beyond, so GTMPath
// is now deprecated.

// GTMPath
//
// This class represents a single, absolute file system path. The represented
// path must exist at the time of creation. This class also allows you to easily
// create new paths (or full hierarchies) based on existing GTMPath instances.
//
// Given a GTMPath instance, new files and directories can be created inside
// that path providing the instance refers to a directory. It is an error to try
// to create a file/directory from a GTMPath that represents a file (this should
// be common sense: clearly mkdir /etc/passwd/foo won't work).
//
// === Examples ===
//
// 1. This sample creates a GTMPath that references /tmp, then gets the
//    attributes for that directory.
//
//   GTMPath *tmp = [GTMPath pathWithFullPath:@"/tmp"];
//   NSDictionary *attr = [tmp attributes];
//
//
// 2. This sample creates a new directory inside /tmp named "foo".
//
//   GTMPath *tmp = [GTMPath pathWithFullPath:@"/tmp"];
//   GTMPath *foo = [tmp createDirectoryName:@"foo" mode:0755];
//
//
// 3. This sample creates a GTMPath instance that represents a user's ~/Library
//    folder.
//
//   GTMPath *library = [GTMPath pathWithFullPath:@"/Users/bob/Library"];
//   ...
//
//
// 4. This sample creates a directory hierarchy, where each level has its own
//    mode. Notice that the return value from these -create* methods is the
//    GTMPath that was just created. This allows these creation calls to be
//    chained together enabling easy creation of directory hierarchies.
//    This is one of the big benefits of this class.
//
//   GTMPath *tmp = [GTMPath pathWithFullPath:@"/tmp"];
//   GTMPath *baz = [[[tmp createDirectoryName:@"foo" mode:0755]
//                        createDirectoryName:@"bar" mode:0756]
//                       createDirectoryName:@"baz" mode:0757];
//
