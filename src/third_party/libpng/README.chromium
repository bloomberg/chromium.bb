Description:
Updated to 1.6.35, stripped all unneeded files.

- Use custom configuration file pnglibconf.h, which turns off all features that
  are not in use.
- Use custom prefix file pngprefix.h, which avoids namespace conflicts with
  pdfium's copy of libpng.
- Configures custom png chunk user limits (crbug.com/117369) in pnglibconf.h.
- Applies the patch in patches/0000-plte.patch for ARM NEON optimizations (this
  change has been accepted to upstream [1] but not yet released).
- Applies the patch in patches/0001-chunkerror.patch (modify
  png_check_chunk_length to call png_benign_error instead of png_chunk_error --
  see crbug.com/827754).
- Keeps the fuzz target in contrib/oss-fuzz/ for running on clusterfuzz.
- Applies the patch in patches/0002-fuzzeroom.patch to prevent clusterfuzz
  running into OOM errors.
