Description:
This contains a part of LZMA SDK 19.00.

Local Modifications:
The original code can be found at http://7-zip.org/a/lzma1900.7z.  Only parts
of this archive are copied here.  More specifically:

1/ C code required to open 7z archive files and uncompress LZMA
2/ 7za.exe and 7zr.exe executables (amd64 version)
3/ source code for SfxSetup, a utility for creating self extracting archives
4/ C code required for xz decompression (split into its own static library)

The patch in Util/SfxSetup/chromium.patch was applied so that:

1/ Fix for includes file names, since the original code causes an include
   file violation during git cl presubmit.
2/ Extended search range for 7z archive signature to accomodate
   increased sfx binary size in debug builds.
