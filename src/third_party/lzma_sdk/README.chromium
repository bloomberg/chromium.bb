Description:
This contains a part of LZMA SDK 15.14.

Local Modifications:
The original code can be found at http://7-zip.org/a/lzma1514.7z.  Only parts
of this archive are copied here.  More specifically:

1/ C code required to open 7z archive files and uncompress LZMA
2/ 7za.exe and 7zr.exe executables (amd64 version)
3/ source code for SfxSetup, a utility for creating self extracting archives
4/ C code required for xz decompression (split into its own static library)

The patch in chromium.patch was applied to CpuArch.c to fix register corruption
that can occur on 64-bit platforms built with -fPIC and register clobbering that
occurred on Mac builds (but in principle can occur anywhere).

The patch in Util/SfxSetup/chromium.patch was applied so that:

1/ The code compiles without warnings which are treated as errors. Warning is:
   C6246: Local declaration hides declaration of same name in outer scope.
2/ Fix for includes file names, since the original code causes an include
   file violation during git cl presubmit.
