// The edge kinds are used in many ways.
//
// For example, consider the edges leaving a basic block and going to distinct
// targets. If the total number of kForward + kIfBreak + kCaseFallThrough edges
// is more than 1, then the block must be a structured header, i.e. it needs
// a merge instruction to declare the control flow divergence and associated
// reconvergence point.  Those those edge kinds count toward divergence
// because SPIR-v is designed to easily map back to structured control flow
// in GLSL (and C).  In GLSL and C, those forward-flow edges don't have a
// special statement to express them.  The other forward edges: kSwitchBreak,
// kLoopBreak, and kLoopContinue directly map to 'break', 'break', and
// 'continue', respectively.

  // A back-edge: An edge from a node to one of its ancestors in a depth-first
  // search from the entry block.
  kBack,

  // where there is no intervening loop.
  kSwitchBreak,
  // An edge from a node to the merge block of the nearest enclosing loop, where
  // there is no intervening switch.
  // The source block is a "break block" as defined by SPIR-V.
  kLoopBreak,
  // An edge from a node in a loop body to the associated continue target, where
  // there are no other intervening loops or switches.
  // The source block is a "continue block" as defined by SPIR-V.
  kLoopContinue,
  // An edge from a node to the merge block of the nearest enclosing structured
  // construct, but which is neither a kSwitchBreak or a kLoopBreak.
  // This can only occur for an "if" selection, i.e. where the selection
  // header ends in OpBranchConditional.

  // An edge from one switch case to the next sibling switch case.
