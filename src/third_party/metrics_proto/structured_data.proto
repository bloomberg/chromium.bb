  //
  //    - int64. The client supplies an int64 value for the metric, and that
  //      value is recorded as-is in value_int64.
  //
  //    - string. The client supplies a string value for the metric, which is
  //      recorded as-is in value_string. This is sometimes referred to as a
  //      "raw string" to differentiate from the following.
  //
  //    - hashed-string. The client supplies an arbitrary string for the metric.
  //      The string itself is not recorded, instead, value_hmac records the
  //      first 8 bytes of:
  //
  //          HMAC_SHA256(concat(string, metric_name), event_key)

  //      key used only for signing hashed values for this event. Keys should
  //      never leave the device, and are rotated at least every 90 days.
