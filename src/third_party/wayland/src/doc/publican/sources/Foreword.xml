  This document describes the (i) Wayland architecture, (ii) Wayland model of
  operation and (iii) its library API. Also, the Wayland protocol specification is shown
  in the Appendix. This document is aimed primarily at Wayland developers and
  those looking to program with it; it does not cover application development.
