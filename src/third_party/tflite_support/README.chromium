Description:
TFLite Support is a toolkit that helps users to develop ML and deploy TFLite
models onto mobile devices.  It works cross-Platform and is supported on
Java, C++ (WIP), and Swift (WIP).

Third party dependencies:
- tflite
- libzip
- utf
- tensorflow-text

Modifications:
01) Use re2::StringPiece instead of absl::string_view in regex_tokenizer.cc
02) Remove support for sentencepiece tokenization because the required overhead
isn't worth adding this functionality, esp since no feature team needs it.
03) [To Be Upstreamed] Remove unused functions.
04) Remove the ABSL_DEPRECATED annotation from a deprecated struct since this
is a no-op in chromium builds and upsets clang.
05) [To Be Upstreamed] Use size_t in for loop in nl_classifier.h
06) [To Be Upstreamed] Remove unused variable in task_utils.h
07) Do not use absl::any since it is not supported in chromium
08) [To Be Upstreamed] Remove unused stl include in tokenizer_jni_lib.h
09) Remove unbuilt files that triggered checkdeps warnings, and fix file perms.
10) Remove memory mapped file support in external_file_handler.cc since it is
only available on POSIX systems.
11) Run clang-format.
12) Remove an unneeded static initializer.
