Description:
TFLite Support is a toolkit that helps users to develop ML and deploy TFLite
models onto mobile devices.  It works cross-Platform and is supported on
Java, C++ (WIP), and Swift (WIP).

Third party dependencies:
- tflite
- libzip
- utf
- tensorflow-text

Modifications:
01) Use re2::StringPiece instead of absl::string_view in regex_tokenizer.cc
02) Remove support for sentencepiece tokenization because the required overhead
isn't worth adding this functionality, esp since no feature team needs it.
03) Remove the ABSL_DEPRECATED annotation from a deprecated struct since this
is a no-op in chromium builds and upsets clang.
04) Do not use absl::any since it is not supported in chromium
05) Remove memory mapped file support in external_file_handler.cc since it is
only available on POSIX systems.
06) Remove an unneeded static initializer.
07) Surface the error from NLClassifier::Classify.
08) Remove unbuilt files that triggered checkdeps warnings, and fix file perms.
  * Note that this patch might not apply cleanly, so just do everything that
  `git cl presubmit` tells you to do.
09) Run clang-format.
  * This patch might not apply cleanly, so run `git cl format` and commit the
  changes.
10) Check (instead of resetting) the cancel_flag_ before Invoking the model.
