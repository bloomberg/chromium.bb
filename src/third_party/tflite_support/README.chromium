Description:
TFLite Support is a toolkit that helps users to develop ML and deploy TFLite
models onto mobile devices.  It works cross-Platform and is supported on
Java, C++ (WIP), and Swift (WIP).

Modifications:
- Use chromium's logging utility in place of glog (patches/0001-use-base-logging.patch)
- Use size_t rather than int for loops according to chromium style (0001-use-size_t.patch)
- Rely on re::StringPiece instead of absl::string_view (0001-use_StringPiece-for_string_view.patch)
- Remove unsafe use of conversions between NSString and string by using SysNSStringToUTF8. Note, this
  is unused code but required for presubmit checks. (0001-use-SysNSStringToUTF8.patch)
- Remove usage of absl::Cord in tflite::support::CreateStatusWithPayload (0001-no-absl-cord.patch)
- Use _Exit instead of _exit to work on all platforms (0001-use-exit.patch)
- Remove external file handlers support for memory mapping files to support Windows
  (0001-remove-unsupported-memory-map-from-file-handler.patch)
- Fixes sign compare issues in tflite-support (0001-task-utils-sign-compare.patch)
- Remove support for sentencepiece tokenizers (0001-no-sentencepiece-tokenizer.patch)
- Allows for the max sequence used by BERT models to be 512 instead of 128 (0001-bert-max-seq-len.patch)
- Ensure name field in metadata exists before checking for tflite metadata (0001-add-metadata-name-check.patch)
