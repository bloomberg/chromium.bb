Description:
TFLite Support is a toolkit that helps users to develop ML and deploy TFLite
models onto mobile devices.  It works cross-Platform and is supported on
Java, C++ (WIP), and Swift (WIP).

Third party dependencies:
- tflite
- libzip
- utf
- tensorflow-text

Modifications:
01) Use re2::StringPiece instead of absl::string_view in regex_tokenizer.cc
02) Remove support for sentencepiece tokenization because the required overhead
isn't worth adding this functionality, esp since no feature team needs it.
03) Remove the ABSL_DEPRECATED annotation from a deprecated struct since this
is a no-op in chromium builds and upsets clang.
04) Do not use absl::any since it is not supported in chromium
05) Remove an unneeded static initializer.
06) Run clang-format.
  * This patch might not apply cleanly, so run `git cl format` and commit the
  changes.
07) Check (instead of resetting) the cancel_flag_ before Invoking the model.
08) Remove unbuilt files that cause presubmit errors.
09) Remove support for creating a model handler from a file.
