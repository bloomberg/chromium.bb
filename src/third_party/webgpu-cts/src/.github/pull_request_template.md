**Requirements for [reviewer sign-off](https://github.com/gpuweb/cts/blob/main/docs/reviews.md):**

- [ ] Tests are properly located in the test tree.
- [ ] [Test descriptions](https://github.com/gpuweb/cts/blob/main/docs/intro/plans.md) allow a reader to "read only the test plans and evaluate coverage completeness", and accurately reflect the test code.
