In this test we test that a small buffer bound to unused buffer slot won't cause validation error.

In this test we test that index buffer OOB is catched as validation error in drawIndexed, but not in
drawIndexedIndirect as it is GPU-validated.

    - range and GPUBuffer are exactly the required size for the draw call

In this test we test the vertex buffer OOB validation in draw calls. Specifically, only vertex step
mode buffer OOB in draw and instance step mode buffer OOB in draw and drawIndexed are CPU-validated.
Other cases are handled by robust access and no validation error occurs.
- Test that:
    - Draw call needs to read {=, >} any bound vertex buffer range, with GPUBuffer that is {large
      enough, exactly the size of bound range}
        - Binding size = 0 (ensure it's not treated as a special case)
        - x= weird offset values
        - x= weird arrayStride values
        - x= {render pass, render bundle}
- For vertex step mode vertex buffer,
    - Test that:
        - vertexCount largeish
        - firstVertex {=, >} 0
        - arrayStride is 0 and bound buffer size too small
    - Validation error occurs in:
        - draw
        - drawIndexed with a zero array stride vertex step mode buffer OOB
    - Otherwise no validation error in drawIndexed, draIndirect and drawIndexedIndirect
- For instance step mode vertex buffer,
    - Test with draw and drawIndexed:
        - instanceCount largeish
        - firstInstance {=, >} 0
        - arrayStride is 0 and bound buffer size too small
    - Validation error occurs in draw and drawIndexed
    - No validation error in drawIndirect and drawIndexedIndirect

In this test, we use a a render pipeline requiring one vertex step mode and one instance step mode
vertex buffer. Then for a given drawing parameter set (e.g., vertexCount, instanceCount, firstVertex,
indexCount), we calculate the exactly required size for vertex step mode vertex buffer, instance
step mode vertex buffer and index buffer. Then, we generate buffer parameters (i.e. GPU buffer size,
binding offset and binding size) for all three buffer, covering both (bound size == required size)
and (bound size == required size - 1), and test that draw and drawIndexed will success/error as
expected. Such set of buffer parameters should include cases like weird offset values.

    wouldn't have been valid before that
