# CanvasKit Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
 - isVolitile option to `CanvasKit.MakeSkVertices`. The previous (and current default) behavior
   was for this to be true; some applications may go faster if set to false.
 - `SkCanvas.saveLayer(rect, paint)`
 - `SkCanvas.restoreToCount(int)` which can be used with the output of .save() and .saveLayer().
 - Optional particles library from modules/particles. `See CanvasKit.MakeParticles(json)`;

## [0.4.1] - 2019-03-01

### Added
 - Optional arguments to `MakeManagedAnimation` for supplying external assets (like images, fonts).

## [0.4.0] - 2019-02-25

### Added
 - `SkPath.addRoundRect`, `SkPath.reset`, `SkPath.rewind` exposed.
 - `SkCanvas.drawArc`, `SkCanvas.drawLine`, `SkCanvas.drawOval`, `SkCanvas.drawRoundRect` exposed.
 - Can import/export a SkPath to an array of commands. See `CanvasKit.MakePathFromCmds` and
   `SkPath.toCmds`.
 - `SkCanvas.drawTextBlob()` and `SkCanvas.SkTextBlob.MakeFromText()` to draw text to a canvas.
 - `CanvasKit.TextEncoding` enum. For use with `SkTextBlob`.
 - Text shaping with `ShapedText` object and `SkCanvas.drawText`. At compile time, one can choose
   between using Harfbuzz/ICU (default) or a primitive one ("primitive_shaper") which just does
   line breaking. Using Harfbuzz/ICU substantially increases code size (4.3 MB to 6.4 MB).

### Changed
 - `SkCanvas.drawText()` now requires an `SkFont` object for raw strings.


### Removed
 -  `SkPaint.setTextSize()`, `SkPaint.getTextSize()`, `SkPaint.setTypeface()`
   which should be replaced by using `SkFont`.
 - Deprecated `CanvasKitInit().then()` interface (see 0.3.1 notes)


### Fixed
 - Potential bug in `ready()` if already loaded.

## [0.3.1] - 2019-01-04
### Added
 - `SkFont` now exposed.
 - `MakeCanvasSurface` can now take a canvas element directly.
 - `MakeWebGLCanvasSurface` can now take a WebGL context as an integer and use it directly.

### Changed
 - `CanvasKitInit(...).then()` is no longer the recommended way to initialize things.
It will be removed in 0.4.0. Use `CanvasKitInit(...).ready()`, which returns a real Promise.

### Removed
- `SkPaint.measureText` - use `SkFont.measureText` instead.

## [0.3.0] - 2018-12-18

### Added
- Add Canvas2D JS layer. This mirrors the HTML Canvas API. This may be omitted at compile time
    it by adding `no_canvas` to the `compile.sh` invocation.
- `CanvasKit.FontMgr.DefaultRef()` and `fontmgr.MakeTypefaceFromData` to load fonts.
- Exposed `SkPath.setVolatile`. Some animations see performance improvements by setting
their paths' volatility to true.

### Fixed
- `SkPath.addRect` now correctly draws counter-clockwise vs clockwise.

### Changed
- `CanvasKit.MakeImageShader` no longer takes encoded bytes, but an `SkImage`, created from
    `CanvasKit.MakeImageFromEncoded`. Additionally, the optional parameters `clampIfUnpremul`
    and `localMatrix` have been exposed.
- `SkPath.arcTo` now takes `startAngle`, `sweepAngle`, `forceMoveTo` as additional parameters.
- `SkPath.stroke` has a new option `precision`  It defaults to 1.0.
- CanvasKit comes with one font (NotoMono) instead of the Skia TestTypeface. Clients are encouraged
  to use the new `fontmgr.MakeTypefaceFromData` for more font variety.

### Removed
- `CanvasKit.initFonts()` - no longer needed.
