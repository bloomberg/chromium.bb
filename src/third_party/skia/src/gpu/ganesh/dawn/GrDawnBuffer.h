// GrDawnBuffer is the GrGpuBuffer implementation for the Dawn backend.
//
// Some notes on the implementation:
//
// LIFETIME AND CREATION
// ---------------------
// When a GrDawnBuffer is constructed, it allocates a GPU buffer. Depending on the requested access
// pattern, the buffer is typically immediately mapped at creation (which happens synchronously and
// relatively fast). If a client requests to create a buffer with data, then it will be immediately
// unmapped after the data is copied into the buffer (see `GrDawnGpu::onCreateBuffer` and
// `GrDawnBuffer::onUpdateData`).
//
// Clients usually create buffers through a GrResourceProvider or a GrStagingBufferManager. These
// buffers are constructed in `GrDawnGpu::onCreateBuffer` and GrDawnGpu is involved in their
// lifetime and mapping. Depending on the requested buffer type, a GrDawnBuffer that is
// initialized as `Mappable::kNot` can itself be backed by another GrDawnBuffer that is owned by a
// GrStagingBufferManager. In this case the CPU mapping happens via the `fStagingBuffer` member
// instead of `fBuffer`. The backing `fStagingBuffer` is initialized in `GrDawnBuffer::onMap` and
// its contents are instructed to be copied into `fBuffer` in `GrDawnBuffer::onUnmap` (which does
// not take effect until the command is submitted to the GPU).
//
// ASYNC MAP/UNMAP
// ---------------
// The Dawn API provides two ways to map the CPU-accessible memory of a wgpu::Buffer:
//    * wgpu::Device::CreateBuffer which can synchronously map the buffer at creation;
//    * wgpu::Buffer::MapAsync which asynchronously maps a buffer at any time.
//
// When a GrDawnBuffer gets created it starts out as mapped (except it gets unmapped immediately if
// initialized with data). A buffer gets unmapped when its owner calls `GrGpuBuffer::unmap()`. A
// buffer that is managed by a GrStagingBufferManager is always unmapped before its ownership is
// passed to the associated GrDawnGpu.
//
// Dawn only provides an asynchronous API for mapping an unmapped buffer and `GrGpuBuffer::map()`
// must work synchronously. However, blocking in a busy-wait that yields to the underlying event
// loop can stall the calling thread in the order of milliseconds. We optimize this specifically
// for staging buffers:
//    1. GrStagingBufferManager first unmaps the buffer and passes its ownership to GrDawnBuffer; at
//       this stage no client is expected to access the buffer and it can remain unmapped.
//    2. GrDawnBuffer requests to map the buffer asynchronously and does not return it back to the
//       backing resource provider until the map finishes. Thus, the buffer is never handed back to
//       clients in an unmapped state.
//    3. If a client needs a staging buffer before the map finishes, they will need to allocate a
//       new buffer which can get mapped at creation and avoid an async map.
//
// For all other buffers, a blocking map procedure is provided which allows them to remap a buffer
// if needed. For instance, a write-only non-staging buffer can be safely unmapped and mapped by a
// client.
