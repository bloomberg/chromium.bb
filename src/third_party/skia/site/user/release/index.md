Release Information
===================

We recommend most clients track our tip-of-tree, as we work hard to keep it
green, and doing so gives us timely feedback and users the best chance of
getting fixes.

If you require less frequent updates, we cut a stable milestone every 6 weeks
along with Chrome.
