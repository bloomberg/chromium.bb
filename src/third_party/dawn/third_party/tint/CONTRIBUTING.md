# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use [Dawn's Gerrit](https://dawn-review.googlesource.com/) for this purpose.

Submissions should follow the [Tint style guide](docs/style_guide.md).

## Pushing to Gerrit

Each change requires a `Change-Id` field in the commit message, which is generated by the [Gerrit commit-msg hook](](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/cmd-hook-commit-msg.html)). \
In a bash terminal, with the current path set to your tint source tree, this can be obtained by running the following:

```bash
f=`git rev-parse --git-dir`/hooks/commit-msg ; mkdir -p $(dirname $f) ; curl -Lo $f https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/tools/hooks/commit-msg ; chmod +x $f
```

If you've already locally committed a change without the `Change-Id`, running `git commit --amend` will add the missing `Change-Id`.

To create a Gerrit change for review, type:

```bash
git push origin HEAD:refs/for/main
```
