###############################################################################
# Template to produce a component for one of Dawn's libraries.
###############################################################################

# Template that produces static and shared versions of the same library as well
# as a target similar to Chromium's component targets.
#  - The shared version exports symbols and has dependent import the symbols
#    as libname.so with target name libname_shared
#  - The static library doesn't export symbols nor make dependents import them
#  - The libname target is similar to a Chromium component and is an alias for
#    either the static or the shared library.
#
# The DEFINE_PREFIX must be provided and must match the respective "_export.h"
# file.
#
# Example usage:
#
#   dawn_component("my_library") {
#     // my_library_export.h must use the MY_LIBRARY_IMPLEMENTATION and
#     // MY_LIBRARY_SHARED_LIBRARY macros.
#     DEFINE_PREFIX = "MY_LIBRARY"
#
#     sources = [...]
#     deps = [...]
#     configs = [...]
#   }
#
#   executable("foo") {
#     deps = [ ":my_library_shared" ] // or :my_library for the same effect
#   }
