Google Test is imported as-is, to facilitate version bumping. However, the
file/directory layout of Google Test is not yet considered stable. Therefore,
until Google Test's layout stabilizes, PDFium code MUST NOT depend on it
directly. Instead, PDFium code MUST:

* #include the headers in testing/gtest and testing/gmock
* use //testing/gtest(:gtest_main) and //testing/gmock(:gmock_main) in BUILD.gn
  deps

This will allow us to adapt to Google Test changes with minimal disruption.
