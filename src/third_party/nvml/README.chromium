Description:
This is a header file for interfacing with the NVML library that ships as a part
of NVIDIA proprietary drivers on Windows. The library can be used to query GPU
hardware and GPU driver information. Chromium loads the NVML library dynamically
and uses it for whitelisting and blacklisting purposes on Windows.
