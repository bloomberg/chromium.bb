Weston
------

Weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, as well as a
useful environment in and of itself.

Out of the box, Weston provides a very basic desktop, or a full-featured
environment for non-desktop uses such as automotive, embedded, in-flight,
industrial, kiosks, set-top boxes and TVs. It also provides a library allowing
other projects to build their own full-featured environments on top of Weston's
core.

The core focus of Weston is correctness and reliability. Weston aims to be lean
and fast, but more importantly, to be predictable. Whilst Weston does have
known bugs and shortcomings, we avoid unknown or variable behaviour as much as
possible, including variable performance such as occasional spikes in frame
display time.
