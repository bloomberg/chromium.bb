- @ref zunitc - Simple test framework

@section tools_overview Overview

The tools area currently consists of one sub-project (@ref zunitc) that is
refined from the prior single weston/tests source folder.

@subsection tools_overview_old Old Code Organization

The original 'tests' folder contained basic weston testing with an
integrated test runner framework. Over time things progressed to the
stage where splitting apart into discrete layers was warranted.

@dotfile tools_arch_old.gv "Original test code organization"

@subsection tools_overview_new New Code Organization

The test code that is not weston-specific gets split out to a separate
folder and/or folders.
