.SH NAME
weston.ini \- configuration file for
.B Weston
\- the reference Wayland
compositor
.SH INTRODUCTION
.B Weston
obtains configuration from its command line parameters and the configuration
file described here.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Weston
uses a configuration file called
.I weston.ini
for its setup.
The
.I weston.ini
configuration file is searched for in one of the following places when the
server is started:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.BR "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/weston.ini   " "(if $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set)"
.BR "$HOME/.config/weston.ini      " "(if $HOME is set)"
.B  "weston/weston.ini in each"
.BR "\ \ \ \ $XDG_CONFIG_DIR           " "(if $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is set)"
.BR "/etc/xdg/weston/weston.ini    " "(if $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS is not set)"
.fi
.RE
.PP
where environment variable
.B $HOME
is the user's home directory, and
.B $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
is the user specific configuration directory, and
.B $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS
is a colon
.B ':'
delimited listed of configuration base directories, such as
.BR /etc/xdg-foo:/etc/xdg .
.PP
The
.I weston.ini
file is composed of a number of sections which may be present in any order, or
omitted to use default configuration values. Each section has the form:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.BI [ SectionHeader ]
.RI Key1=Value1
.RI Key2=Value2
    ...
.fi
.RE
.PP
The spaces are significant.

Possible value types are string, signed and unsigned 32-bit
integer, and boolean. Strings must not be quoted, do not support any
escape sequences, and run till the end of the line. Integers can
be given in decimal (e.g. 123), octal (e.g. 0173), and hexadecimal
(e.g. 0x7b) form. Boolean values can be only 'true' or 'false'.
.RE
.SH "CORE SECTION"
The
.B core
section is used to select the startup compositor modules and general options.
.TP 7
.BI "shell=" desktop-shell.so
specifies a shell to load (string). This can be used to load your own
implemented shell or one with Weston as default. Available shells
in the

directory are:
.PP
.RS 10
.nf
.BR drm-backend.so
.BR fbdev-backend.so
.BR headless-backend.so
.BR rdp-backend.so
.BR wayland-backend.so
.BR x11-backend.so
.fi
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "repaint-window=" N
Set the approximate length of the repaint window in milliseconds. The repaint
window is used to control and reduce the output latency for clients. If the
window is longer than the output refresh period, the repaint will be done
immediately when the previous repaint finishes, not processing client requests
in between. If the repaint window is too short, the compositor may miss the
target vertical blank, increasing output latency. The default value is 7
milliseconds. The allowed range is from -10 to 1000 milliseconds. Using a
negative value will force the compositor to always miss the target vblank.
.TP 7
.BI "gbm-format="format
sets the GBM format used for the framebuffer for the GBM backend. Can be
.B xrgb8888,
.B xrgb2101010,
.B rgb565.
By default, xrgb8888 is used.
.RS
.PP
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "idle-time="seconds
sets Weston's idle timeout in seconds. This idle timeout is the time
after which Weston will enter an "inactive" mode and screen will fade to
black. A value of 0 disables the timeout.

.IR Important
: This option may also be set via Weston's '-i' command
line option and will take precedence over the current .ini option. This
means that if both weston.ini and command line define this idle-timeout
time, the one specified in the command-line will be used. On the other
hand, if none of these sets the value, default idle timeout will be
set to 300 seconds.
.RS
.PP
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "require-input=" true
require an input device for launch
.TP 7
.BI "pageflip-timeout="milliseconds
sets Weston's pageflip timeout in milliseconds.  This sets a timer to exit
gracefully with a log message and an exit code of 1 in case the DRM driver is
non-responsive.  Setting it to 0 disables this feature.
.TP 7
.BI "wait-for-debugger=" true
Raises SIGSTOP before initializing the compositor. This allows the user to
attach with a debugger and continue execution by sending SIGCONT. This is
useful for debugging a crash on start-up when it would be inconvenient to
launch weston directly from a debugger. Boolean, defaults to
.BR false .
There is also a command line option to do the same.
.TP 7
.BI "remoting="remoting-plugin.so
specifies a plugin for remote output to load (string). This can be used to load
your own implemented remoting plugin or one with Weston as default. Available
remoting plugins in the
.IR "__libweston_modules_dir__"
directory are:
.PP
.RS 10
.nf
.BR remoting-plugin.so
.fi
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "use-pixman=" true
Enables pixman-based rendering for all outputs on backends that support it.
Boolean, defaults to
.BR false .
There is also a command line option to do the same.

.SH "LIBINPUT SECTION"
The
.B libinput
section is used to configure input devices when using the libinput input device
backend. The defaults are determined by libinput and vary according to what is
most sensible for any given device.
.PP
Available configuration are:
.TP 7
.BI "enable-tap=" false
Enables tap to click on touchpad devices.
.TP 7
.BI "tap-and-drag=" false
For touchpad devices with \fBenable-tap\fR enabled. If the user taps, then
taps a second time, this time holding, the virtual mouse button stays down for
as long as the user keeps their finger on the touchpad, allowing the user to
click and drag with taps alone.
.TP 7
.BI "tap-and-drag-lock=" false
For touchpad devices with \fBenable-tap\fR and \fBtap-and-drag\fR enabled.
In the middle of a tap-and-drag, if the user releases the touchpad for less
than a certain number of milliseconds, then touches it again, the virtual mouse
button will remain pressed and the drag can continue.
.TP 7
.BI "disable-while-typing=" true
For devices that may be accidentally triggered while typing on the keyboard,
causing a disruption of the typing.  Disables them while the keyboard is in
use.
.TP 7
.BI "middle-button-emulation=" false
For pointer devices with left and right buttons, but no middle button.  When
enabled, a middle button event is emitted when the left and right buttons are
pressed simultaneously.
.TP 7
.BI "left-handed=" false
Configures the device for use by left-handed people. Exactly what this option
does depends on the device. For pointers with left and right buttons, the
buttons are swapped. On tablets, the tablet is logically turned upside down,
because it will be physically turned upside down.
.TP 7
.BI "rotation=" n
Changes the direction of the logical north, rotating it \fIn\fR degrees
clockwise away from the default orientation, where \fIn\fR is a whole
number between 0 and 359 inclusive. Needed for trackballs, mainly. Allows the
user to orient the trackball sideways, for example.
.TP 7
.BI "accel-profile=" "{flat,adaptive}"
Set the pointer acceleration profile. The pointer's screen speed is
proportional to the physical speed with a certain constant of proportionality.
Call that constant alpha. \fIflat\fR keeps alpha fixed. See \fBaccel-speed\fR.
\fIadaptive\fR causes alpha to increase with physical speed, giving the user
more control when the speed is slow, and more reach when the speed is high.
\fIadaptive\fR is the default.
.TP 7
.BI "accel-speed=" v
If \fBaccel-profile\fR is set to \fIflat\fR, it simply sets the value of alpha.
If \fBaccel-profile\fR is set to \fIadaptive\fR, the effect is more
complicated, but generally speaking, it will change the pointer's speed.
\fIv\fR is normalised and must lie in the range [-1, 1]. The exact mapping
between \fIv\fR and alpha is hardware-dependent, but higher values cause higher
cursor speeds.
.TP 7
.BI "natural-scroll=" false
Enables natural scrolling, mimicking the behaviour of touchscreen scrolling.
That is, if the wheel, finger, or fingers are moved down, the surface is
scrolled up instead of down, as if the finger, or fingers were in contact with
the surface being scrolled.
.TP 7
.BI "scroll-method=" {two-finger,edge,button,none}
Sets the scroll method. \fItwo-finger\fR scrolls with two fingers on a
touchpad. \fIedge\fR scrolls with one finger on the right edge of a touchpad.
\fIbutton\fR scrolls when the pointer is moved while a certain button is
pressed. See \fBscroll-button\fR. \fInone\fR disables scrolling altogether.
.TP 7
.BI "scroll-button=" {BTN_LEFT,BTN_RIGHT,BTN_MIDDLE,...}
For devices with \fBscroll-method\fR set to \fIbutton\fR. Specifies the
button that will trigger scrolling. See /usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h
for the complete list of possible values.
.TP 7
.BI "touchscreen_calibrator=" true
Advertise the touchscreen calibrator interface to all clients. This is a
potential denial-of-service attack vector, so it should only be enabled on
trusted userspace. Boolean, defaults to
.BR false .

The interface is required for running touchscreen calibrator applications. It
provides the application raw touch events, bypassing the normal touch handling.
It also allows the application to upload a new calibration into the compositor.

Even though this option is listed in the libinput section, it does affect all
Weston configurations regardless of the used backend. If the backend does not
use libinput, the interface can still be advertised, but it will not list any
devices.
.TP 7
.BI "calibration_helper=" /bin/echo
An optional calibration helper program to permanently save a new touchscreen
calibration. String, defaults to unset.

The given program will be executed with seven arguments when a calibrator
application requests the server to take a new calibration matrix into use.
The program is executed synchronously and will therefore block Weston for its
duration. If the program exit status is non-zero, Weston will not apply the
new calibration. If the helper is unset or the program exit status is zero,
Weston will use the new calibration immediately.

The program is invoked as:
.PP
.RS 10
.I calibration_helper syspath m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m6
.RE
.RS
.PP
.RI "where " syspath
is the udev sys path for the device and
.IR m1 "  through " m6
are the calibration matrix elements in libinput's
.BR LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX " udev property format."
The sys path is an absolute path and starts with the sys mount point.
.RE

.SH "SHELL SECTION"
The
.B shell
section is used to customize the compositor. Some keys may not be handled by
different shell plugins.
.PP
The entries that can appear in this section are:
.TP 7
.BI "client=" file
sets the path for the shell client to run. If not specified
.I @weston_shell_client@
is launched (string).
.TP 7
.BI "background-image=" file
sets the path for the background image file (string).
.TP 7
.BI "background-type=" tile
determines how the background image is drawn (string). Can be
.BR centered ", " scale ", " scale-crop " or " tile " (default)."
Centered shows the image once centered. If the image is smaller than the
output, the rest of the surface will be in background color. If the image
size does fit the output it will be cropped left and right, or top and bottom.
Scale means scaled to fit the output precisely, not preserving aspect ratio.
Scale-crop preserves aspect ratio, scales the background image just big
enough to cover the output, and centers it. The image ends up cropped from
left and right, or top and bottom, if the aspect ratio does not match the
output. Tile repeats the background image to fill the output.
.TP 7
.BI "background-color=" 0xAARRGGBB
sets the color of the background (unsigned integer). The hexadecimal
digit pairs are in order alpha, red, green, and blue.
.TP 7
.BI "clock-format=" format
sets the panel clock format (string). Can be
.BR "none" ","
.BR "minutes" ","
.BR "seconds" "."
By default, minutes format is used.
.TP 7
.BI "panel-color=" 0xAARRGGBB
sets the color of the panel (unsigned integer). The hexadecimal
digit pairs are in order transparency, red, green, and blue. Examples:
.PP

.SH "OUTPUT SECTION"
There can be multiple output sections, each corresponding to one output. It is
currently only recognized by the drm and x11 backends.
.TP 7
.BI "name=" name
sets a name for the output (string). The backend uses the name to
identify the output. All X11 output names start with a letter X.  All
Wayland output names start with the letters WL.  The available
output names for DRM backend are listed in the

.RE
.TP 7
.BI "scale=" factor
The scaling multiplier applied to the entire output, in support of high
resolution ("HiDPI" or "retina") displays, that roughly corresponds to the
pixel ratio of the display's physical resolution to the logical resolution.
Applications that do not support high resolution displays typically appear tiny
and unreadable. Weston will scale the output of such applications by this
multiplier, to make them readable. Applications that do support their own output
scaling can draw their content in high resolution, in which case they avoid
compositor scaling. Weston will not scale the output of such applications, and
they are not affected by this multiplier.
.RE
.RS
.PP
An integer, 1 by default, typically configured as 2 or higher when needed,
denoting the scaling multiplier for the output.
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "seat=" name
The logical seat name that this output should be associated with. If this
is set then the seat's input will be confined to the output that has the seat
set on it. The expectation is that this functionality will be used in a
multiheaded environment with a single compositor for multiple output and input
configurations. The default seat is called "default" and will always be
present. This seat can be constrained like any other.
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "allow_hdcp=" true
Allows HDCP support for this output. If set to true, HDCP can be tried for the
content-protection, provided by the backends, on this output. By
default, HDCP support is always allowed for an output. The
content-protection can actually be realized, only if the hardware
(source and sink) support HDCP, and the backend has the implementation
of content-protection protocol. Currently, no backend actually
implements HDCP yet.
