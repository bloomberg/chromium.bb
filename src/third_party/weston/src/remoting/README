	Remoting plugin for Weston


The Remoting plugin creates a streaming image of a virtual output and transmits
it to a remote host. It is currently only supported on the drm-backend. Virtual
outputs are created and configured by adding a remote-output section to
weston.ini. See man weston-drm(7) for configuration details. This plugin is
loaded automatically if any remote-output sections are present.

This plugin sends motion jpeg images to a client via RTP using gstreamer, and
so requires gstreamer-1.0. This plugin starts sending images immediately when
weston is run, and keeps sending them until weston shuts down. The image stream
can be received by any appropriately configured RTP client, but a sample
gstreamer RTP client script can be found at doc/scripts/remoting-client-receive.bash.

Script usage:
	remoting-client-receive.bash <PORT NUMBER>
