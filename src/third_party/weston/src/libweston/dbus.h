 * weston_dbus_open() - Open new dbus connection

 * integrates the new connection into the main-loop @loop. The connection
 * itself is returned in @out.
 * This also returns a context source used for dbus dispatching. It is
 * returned on success in @ctx_out and must be passed to weston_dbus_close()
 * unchanged. You must not access it from outside of a dbus helper!
