/** Subscriber allows each type of stream to customize or to provide its own
 * methods to manipulate the underlying storage. It follows also an
 * object-oriented approach, contains the ops callbacks and a list of
 * subcriptions of type weston_log_subscription. Each subscription created will
 * be both added to this subscription list and that of the weston_log_scope.
 *
 * A kind of stream can inherit the subscriber class and provide its own callbacks:
 * @code
 * struct weston_log_data_stream {
 * 	struct weston_log_subscriber base;
 * 	struct weston_data_stream opaque;
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Passing the base class will require container retrieval type of methods
 * to be allowed to reach the opaque type (i.e., container_of()).
