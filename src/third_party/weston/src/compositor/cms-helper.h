/* General overview on how to be a CMS plugin:
 *
 * First, some nomenclature:
 *
 *  CMF:       Color management framework, i.e. "Use foo.icc for device $bar"
 *  CMM:       Color management module that converts pixel colors, which is
 *             usually lcms2 on any modern OS.
 *  CMS:       Color management system that encompasses both a CMF and CMM.
 *  ICC:       International Color Consortium, the people that define the
 *             binary encoding of a .icc file.
 *  VCGT:      Video Card Gamma Tag. An Apple extension to the ICC specification
 *             that allows the calibration state to be stored in the ICC profile
 *  Output:    Physical port with a display attached, e.g. LVDS1
 *
 * As a CMF is probably something you don't want or need on an embedded install
 * these functions will not be called if the icc_profile key is set for a
 * specific [output] section in weston.ini
 *
 * Most desktop environments want the CMF to decide what profile to use in
 * different situations, so that displays can be profiled and also so that
 * the ICC profiles can be changed at runtime depending on the task or ambient
 * environment.
 *
 * The CMF can be selected using the 'modules' key in the [core] section.
