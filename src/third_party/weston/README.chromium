--[ UPDATING ] -----------------
To update, change the commit hash with the most recent hash as mentioned on
the official repo inside the DEPS file.
You need to have clang (//third_party/llvm-build/Release+Asserts/bin),
and meson (https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/releases) in your path.
Then do gclient sync which will align your local Weston folder with the most
recent one as mentioned in the hash. Then run the generate_configs.py script
to generate and update necessary config files. To compile weston, pass the
following GN arguments while generating build files, since gn gen is meant
to generate ninja files not gn ones.
use_ozone = true use_bundled_weston = true

Finally, compile-test the Weston target.
Steps to be followed:
gclient sync
python3 third_party/weston/generate_configs.py
autoninja out/build_dir weston

To update the weston to the version present upstream, change the commit hash
inside url in the 'src/third_party/weston/src' field with the most recent one in
DEPS file. Then follow the above steps to compile the updated weston.
