Description:
Scripts which can download and build several third party libraries
using different instrumentation tools (AddressSanitizer, etc.).

Flag "use_instrumented_libraries=1" in GYP_DEFINES enables usage of
instrumented libraries and final binary will use them instead of standard
system shared libraries.
