This directory contains the implementation of the client library for a cache
invalidation service.

The public (stable) interfaces are those defined under include/:
  invalidation-client.h
  invalidation-client-factory.h
  invalidation-listener.h
  system-resources.h
  types.h

In order to compile this library, proper implementations of the interfaces
residing under deps/ must be provided.

Interfaces and implementations defined under impl/ are subject to change, and
the test/ directory contains test helpers.  Please do not depend directly
on anything in these directories.
