Description:
Crashpad is a crash-reporting system. It’s the successor to Breakpad.

Crashpad’s authoritative upstream repository is
https://chromium.googlesource.com/crashpad/crashpad.

Because Crashpad depends on some Chromium code (notably base and build), it is
acceptable to make changes to this in-Chromium copy of Crashpad in order to
conform to interface changes in Chromium. These changes must be noted in the
“local modifications” section below, and should also be reflected in the
authoritative Crashpad repository as soon as practical.

Substantive development must occur in the authoritative Crashpad repository. If
this type of work is done in the in-Chromium copy, it will be obliterated the
next time Crashpad is imported into Chromium.

To update the in-Chromium copy of Crashpad, run update.py, located in this
directory.

To carry changes made in Chromium to Crashpad, run:
$ cd "${THIS_DIR}"
$ mkdir /tmp/patchdir
$ git format-patch -1 --binary --output-directory=/tmp/patchdir/cur "${HASH}" \
      --add-header="Message-Id: Merged from chromium ${HASH}" -- crashpad/
$ cd "${CRASHPAD_DIR}"
$ git am --3way --message-id -p4 /tmp/patchdir
