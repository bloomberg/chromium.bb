Description:
XNU is the operating system kernel used on macOS and other Apple systems.

Local Modifications:
 - Only EXTERNAL_HEADERS/mach-o/loader.h is included. Its #includes of
   <mach/machine/thread_status.h> and <architecture/byte_order.h> have been
   removed as unnecessary. Note that its #includes of <mach/machine.h> and
   <mach/vm_prot.h> have been retained but these headers have not been provided.
   External headers must be made available to provide the cpu_type_t,
   cpu_subtype_t, and vm_prot_t types.
