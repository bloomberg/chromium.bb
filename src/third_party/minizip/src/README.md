## History

Minizip was originally developed by [Gilles Vollant](https://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html) and 
had been contributed to by many people. As part of the zlib distribution, Mark Adler still maintains the
original [minizip](https://github.com/madler/zlib/tree/master/contrib/minizip) project which is included in this repository as a reference.

My work with the minizip library began in 2006 when I started submitting bugs I found to 
Gilles Vollant. In 2010, I implemented some additional features like WinZip AES encryption, disk splitting, and 
I/O buffering that were necessary for another project I was working on. Shortly after, I created this public repository 
so I could share these and other improvements with the rest of the world. I have been maintaining and actively 
developing this code base ever since. At the beginning of 2017, I began the work to refactor and rewrite 
the library as version 2 because it had become difficult to maintain and code readability suffered over the years.

## Features

+ Creating and extracting zip archives.
+ Adding and removing entries from zip archives.
+ Read and write raw zip entry data.
+ Reading and writing zip archives from memory.
+ Zlib, BZIP2, and LZMA compression methods.
+ Password protection through Traditional PKWARE and [WinZIP AES](https://www.winzip.com/aes_info.htm) encryption.
+ Buffered streaming for improved I/O performance.
+ NTFS timestamp support for UTC last modified, last accessed, and creation dates.
+ Disk split support for splitting zip archives into multiple files.
+ Preservation of file attributes across file systems.
+ Unicode filename support through UTF-8 encoding.
+ Legacy character encoding support CP437, CP932, CP936, CP950.
+ Turn off compilation of compression, decompression, or encryption.
+ Windows (Win32 & WinRT), macOS and Linux platform support.
+ Streaming interface for easy implementation of additional platforms.
+ Support for Apple's compression library ZLIB implementation.
+ Zero out local file header information.
+ Zip/unzip of central directory to reduce size.
+ Ability to generate and verify CMS signature for each entry.
+ Recover the central directory if it is corrupt or missing.
+ Example minizip command line tool.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to [Gilles Vollant](https://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html) on which this work is originally based on. 

Thanks go out to all the people who have taken the time to contribute code reviews, testing and/or patches. This project would not have been nearly as good without you.

The [ZIP format](https://github.com/nmoinvaz/minizip/blob/master/doc/appnote.txt) was defined by Phil Katz of PKWARE.
