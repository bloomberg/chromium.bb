# Unit tests

You can run the unit tests with `npm run auto-unittest`.
Unit tests are written using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) and run with [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) in a web browser.

## Running a subset of unit tests
If you want to run a specific (set of) unit test, you can use `it.only` or `describe.only` for those tests that you want to run.

```ts
describe.only('The test suite that you want to run', () => {
  it('A test that would run', () => {});
  it('Another test that would run', () => {});
});
```

```ts
describe('The test suite that you want to run', () => {
  it.only('A test that would run', () => {});
  it('A test that would not run', () => {});
});
```

## Obtaining code coverage

We can collect code coverage for the source code that is tested with unit tests.
You can run `COVERAGE=1 npm run auto-unittest` to obtain code coverage for the whole `front_end` folder.
However, there is some preprocessing overhead for collecting coverage.
You can use `COVERAGE_FOLDERS` to only preprocess specific folders for code coverage:

```bash
COVERAGE_FOLDERS='front_end/ui/components' npm run auto-unittest
COVERAGE_FOLDERS='front_end/{ui/components,core/common}' npm run auto-unittest
```

The code coverage output is written to `/karma-coverage` in the repository root.
You can open `/karma-coverage/index.html` in a browser to inspect coverage for individual files.

## Inspecting detailed errors

By default, the Karma testing output is terse, to avoid console output cluttering.
However, if you want to obtain detailed reporting of a failure you are investigating, you can use `--expanded-reporting`:

```bash
npm run auto-unittest -- --expanded-reporting
```

### Debugging with VSCode

To run tests under the debugger, open the "Run and Debug" sidebar,
select "Run unit tests in VS Code debugger" from the dropdown, and click
the start button or press F5.
