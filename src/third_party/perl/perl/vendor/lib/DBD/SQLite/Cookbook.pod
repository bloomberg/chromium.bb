=head1 NAME

DBD::SQLite::Cookbook - The DBD::SQLite Cookbook

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the L<DBD::SQLite> cookbook.

It is intended to provide a place to keep a variety of functions and
formals for use in callback APIs in L<DBD::SQLite>.

=head1 AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS

=head2 Variance

This is a simple aggregate function which returns a variance. It is
adapted from an example implementation in pysqlite.

  package variance;
  
  sub new { bless [], shift; }
  
  sub step {
      my ( $self, $value ) = @_;
  
      push @$self, $value;
  }
  
  sub finalize {
      my $self = $_[0];
  
      my $n = @$self;
  
      # Variance is NULL unless there is more than one row
      return undef unless $n || $n == 1;
  
      my $mu = 0;
      foreach my $v ( @$self ) {
          $mu += $v;
      }
      $mu /= $n;
  
      my $sigma = 0;
      foreach my $v ( @$self ) {
          $sigma += ($v - $mu)**2;
      }
      $sigma = $sigma / ($n - 1);
  
      return $sigma;
  }
  
  # NOTE: If you use an older DBI (< 1.608),
  # use $dbh->func(..., "create_aggregate") instead.
  $dbh->sqlite_create_aggregate( "variance", 1, 'variance' );

The function can then be used as:

  SELECT group_name, variance(score)
  FROM results
  GROUP BY group_name;

=head2 Variance (Memory Efficient)

A more efficient variance function, optimized for memory usage at the
expense of precision:

  package variance2;
  
  sub new { bless {sum => 0, count=>0, hash=> {} }, shift; }
  
  sub step {
      my ( $self, $value ) = @_;
      my $hash = $self->{hash};
  
      # by truncating and hashing, we can comsume many more data points
      $value = int($value); # change depending on need for precision
                            # use sprintf for arbitrary fp precision
      if (exists $hash->{$value}) {
          $hash->{$value}++;
      } else {
          $hash->{$value} = 1;
      }
      $self->{sum} += $value;
      $self->{count}++;
  }
  
  sub finalize {
      my $self = $_[0];
  
      # Variance is NULL unless there is more than one row
      return undef unless $self->{count} > 1;
  
      # calculate avg
      my $mu = $self->{sum} / $self->{count};
  
      my $sigma = 0;
      while (my ($h, $v) = each %{$self->{hash}}) {
          $sigma += (($h - $mu)**2) * $v;
      }
      $sigma = $sigma / ($self->{count} - 1);
  
      return $sigma;
  }

The function can then be used as:

  SELECT group_name, variance2(score)
  FROM results
  GROUP BY group_name;

=head2 Variance (Highly Scalable)

A third variable implementation, designed for arbitrarily large data sets:

  package variance3;
  
  sub new { bless {mu=>0, count=>0, S=>0}, shift; }
  
  sub step {
      my ( $self, $value ) = @_;
      $self->{count}++;
      my $delta = $value - $self->{mu};
      $self->{mu} += $delta/$self->{count};
      $self->{S} += $delta*($value - $self->{mu});
  }
  
  sub finalize {
      my $self = $_[0];
      return $self->{S} / ($self->{count} - 1);
  }

The function can then be used as:

  SELECT group_name, variance3(score)
  FROM results
  GROUP BY group_name;

=head1 FTS3 fulltext indexing

=head2 Sparing database disk space

As explained in L<http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#section_6>, each
FTS3 table C<I<t>> is stored internally within three regular tables
C<I<t>_content>, C<I<t>_segments> and C<I<t>_segdir>.  The last two
tables contain the fulltext index.  The first table C<I<t>_content>
stores the complete documents being indexed ... but if copies of the
same documents are already stored somewhere else, or can be computed
from external resources (for example as HTML or MsWord files in the
filesystem), then this is quite a waste of space. SQLite itself only
needs the C<I<t>_content> table for implementing the C<offsets()> and
C<snippet()> functions, which are not always usable anyway (in particular
when using utf8 characters greater than 255).

So an alternative strategy is to use SQLite only for the fulltext
index and metadata, and to keep the full documents outside of SQLite :
to do so, after each insert or update in the FTS3 table, do an update
in the C<I<t>_content> table, setting the content column(s) to
NULL. Of course your application will need an algorithm for finding
the external resource corresponding to any I<docid> stored within
SQLite. Furthermore, SQLite C<offsets()> and C<snippet()> functions
cannot be used, so if such functionality is needed, it has to be
directly programmed within the Perl application.
In short, this strategy is really a hack, because FTS3 was not originally
programmed with that behaviour in mind; however it is workable
and has a strong impact on the size of the database file.

=head1 SUPPORT

Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at

L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=DBD-SQLite>

=head1 TO DO

* Add more and varied cookbook recipes, until we have enough to
turn them into a separate CPAN distribution.

* Create a series of tests scripts that validate the cookbook recipies.
