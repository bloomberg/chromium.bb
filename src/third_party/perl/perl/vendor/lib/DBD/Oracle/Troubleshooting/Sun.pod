DBD::Oracle::Troubleshooting::Sun - Tips and Hints to Troubleshoot DBD::Oracle on Sun

=head1 VERSION

version 1.76

=head1 General Info

If you get this on a Solaris 9 and 10 box

  "Outofmemory!
   Callback called exit.
   END failed--call queue aborted."

The solution may be as simple as not having you "ORACLE_HOME" Defined in the
environment.

It seems that having it defined will prevent the error.

=head1 Setting library load path for instant client libraries

Usually you set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the location of
your Oracle Instant Client (you need to do this when building
DBD::Oracle). However, afterwards it can be a pain to keep
ensuring this is set and changing LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your Perl
script does not work (needs to be done beforehand) as the dynamic
linker caches its value.

An alternative under newer versions of Solaris is:

root>  crle -u -l /youroracledir/lib/instantclient_11_2

however, make sure you check the crle options as you may need to
set the architecture etc as well.
