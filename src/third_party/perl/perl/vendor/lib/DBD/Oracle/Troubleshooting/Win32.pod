DBD::Oracle::Troubleshooting::Win32 - Tips and Hints to Troubleshoot DBD::Oracle on Win32

=head1 VERSION

version 1.76

=head1 GENERAL INFO

In general, on Windows, it's best to just use ActiveState Perl and the
PPM package manager to install a pre-built version of DBD::Oracle however only version 1.17 is available there.

=head1 Oracle Instant Client 11.1.0.6.0 Notes

So far I have managed to get it to Makefile and compile test and install and work.  However it seems one needs to set "NLS_LANG" to a valid value
in the environment variables.

As well IC 11 seems to have trouble finding the .ORA files. A quick fix for this is to add "TNS_ADMIN"
to the environment variables and point it to where your .ORA files are.

    DBD-Oracle for Windows and Oracle Instantclient and 10XE (Express Edition)
    By: John Scoles
    The Pythian Group

The preferred method of getting DBD::Oracle is to use a pre-built version from the ActiveState
repository, which can be installed with PPM.

Compiling and installing DBD::Oracle 1.18 or later on a windows 2000 professional or XP OS for use
with Oracle instantClient ver 10.2.0.1 & 10.1.0.5 or Oracle XE requires only a few downloads and
a minimal number of environment setting.  The procedures below were tested on a clean
Windows platform having no Oracle or other development environment installed.

    1) The first part of the process is to download and install the latest version of
    Active Perl from http://www.activeperl.com/.

    2) Use the PPM application to get the latest version of DBI

    3) Download the latest DBD::Oracle from http://svn.perl.org/modules/dbd-oracle/trunk/

    4) Download and unzip the Oracle Instant Client (10.2.0.1 or 10.1.0.5) 32 bit from
    http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/oci/instantclient/instantclient.html
    You will need all three of these products
        i.	Instant Client Package - Basic
        ii.	Instant Client Package - SQL*Plus:
        iii.	Instant Client Package - SDK:
    or

    install oracle 10XE http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/xe/index.html

    5) You will now need the Microsoft Visual C++ toolkit 2003. Unfortunately this product is no longer available from Microsoft.
    The file name was VCToolkitSetup.exe  and is available at this mirror site http://www.filewatcher.com/m/VCToolkitSetup.exe.32952488.0.0.html at the time of writing.
    Microsoft's replacement for this tool kit is Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition and all attempts to compile DBD::Oracle with this product fail. It has been successfully compiled
    using a complete edition of Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.
    Download and then install this product.

    6) You will also need the Windows SDK. Which can be found at
    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A55B6B43-E24F-4EA3-A93E-40C0EC4F68E5&displaylang=en
    You have the choice to of either to download the entire SDK and install or run an online install from the page.
    Both have been tested and proven to work.

    7) Next download and install the Microsoft .net framework 1.1 skd from
    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b3a2ca6-3647-4070-9f41-a333c6b9181d&displaylang=en

    8) You will also need a copy of nmake.exe which you can download here http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/patch/1.52/w95/en-us/nmake15.exe

    9) Enough Downloading and installing go have a coffee.

    10) You should at this time attempt to connect to an Oracle database with the version SQL*Plus that
    you installed in step 4.  If you are unable to connect at this stage then any problems you encounter
    later may have nothing to do with DBD::Oracle

    11) On the path where you installed Visual C++ find and edit the vcvars32.bat file as follows.  You may have to modify
        these path values depending where you installed the products on you computer,

        i.   Add  the local path to the windows platform SDK include directory to the Set INCLUDE
                Command Line to include the needed files from the Windows SDK.

                e.g.  "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include;"

        ii.  Add the local path to the .net Vc7 lib directory to the Set LIB command
                to include the needed library file from the .Net SKD

                e.g. C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\lib;

            iii. Add the local path to the windows platform SDK Lib directory to the Set Lib command
                to include the needed library files from the Windows SDK

            e.g. C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Lib;

    12) Open a Windows Visual C++ command window from the start menu.

    13) Add the path to the instant client to the Path command. If you are compiling against a 10XE db/client then you can skip steps
        12 to 14.
        e.g.  PATH = C:/Oracle/instantclient;%PATH%

    14) Using the "Set" command add "ORACLE_HOME=path to Instant client" to the environment variables.
        e.g. Set ORACLE_HOME=C:\Oracle\instantclient

    15) Using the "Set" command add "NLS_LANG=.WE8ISO8859P15" to the environment variables. The globalization variable is required,
        with this or another compatible value, by Oracle instantclient in order for it to compile correctly.
        e.g. Set NLS_LANG=.WE8ISO8859P15

    16) Using the "Set" command add "ORACLE_USERID=test/test@test" substituting test with the username/password@database
        you wish to run the make test files against.
            Note: it is not necessary to do this step for the compile and install to work.
        However: The self-test programs included with Oracle-DBD will mostly fail.

    17) Move to the DBD-Oracle directory in the Visual C++ window DOS prompt and enter the following.

                c:\oracle-dbd\>perl Makefile.PL

        The Makefile should then run and compile Oracle-dbd without reporting any errors.

    18) From this DOS prompt enter the following command

            c:\oracle-dbd\>nmake

        The Visual C++ make executable will then build you DBD-execuable. There should be no errors at this point.

    19) You can test the compile by either entering

            c:\oracle-dbd\>nmake test

        As long as you have given a valid user name, password and database name in step 15 you will see some results.  If it appears to
        run but you do not get a connection check the following.

            i.   User name password and DB Name
            ii.  Ensure the a valid TNSNAMES.ORA file is in the Instantclient directory
            iii. Attempt to log into the version of SQLPLUS that comes with Instantclient.
                        If you manage to log on use the username password and TNS name with
                        the Set ORACLE_USERID = and rerun the tests.
                    iv   If you are compiling against 10XE and have skipped steps 12 to 14 try again bu this time carry out these steps

    20) You can now install DBD-Oracle into you system by entering the following command from the Visual C++ window dos prompt;

                c:\oracle-dbd\>nmake install

    21) You should now be able to run DBD-Oracle on you system

DBD::Oracle 1.18a

Linux, Debian unstable (
DBI: 1.52
perl v5.8.8 built for i486-linux-gnu-thread-multi
)

Oracle Instant client (10.1.0.5)

The problem is in Makefile.PL. In line 130 the function find_oracle_home
is used to guess a value form $ORACLE_HOME if it is not set explicitly.
This value is used in line 138 to setup the environment (regardless
which client is used).

in line 1443 (sub get_client_version) sqlplus is used to get the
version string, but for the oracle instant client you must not set
$ORACLE_HOME (it will generate an error "SP2-0642: SQL*Plus internal
error state 2165, context 4294967295:0:0")

A solution that worked for me was to set
local $ENV{ORACLE_HOME} = '';
in line 1463 immediately before sqlplus is called (but I cannot tell if
this fails for full client installations)

I have confirmed that this Makefile.pl will work for both Oracle InstantClient
10.2.0.1 & 10.1.0.4 using same process the Andy Hassall uses. Starting with a clean OD
One needs only to get the latest version of Active Perl 5.8.7 use PPM to get DBI and then
install Microsoft Visual C++ toolkit, Windows SDK, and the Microsoft .net
framework 1.1. and modify the vcvars32.bat in C++ dir as follows

   1) Add  the local path to the windows platform SDK include directory to the
      Set INCLUDE Command Line to include the needed files from the Windows SDK.
        e.g.  "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include;"
   2) Add the local path to the .net Vc7 lib directory to the Set LIB
      command to include the needed library files from the .Net SKD
        e.g. C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\Vc7\lib;
   3) Add the local path to the windows platform SDK Lib directory to the Set Lib
      command to include the needed library files from the Windows SDK
        e.g. C:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Lib;

If one happens to have visual studio installed you may not have to download additional MS products.

12/01/05 --- John Scoles
Oracle 10XE
No big problem here as 10XE seems to use the instantclient as well. Just ensure your
 NLS_LANG and ORACLE_HOME are set to the same directory that 10XE uses

10/07/05 --John Scoles
Andy Hassall kindly added some changes to the Makefile.PL
so it will work for the Instant Client 10g on Windows OSs.  Below is how he set
up his environment and the steps he preformed to get it to compile.

  Setting environment for using Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 tools.
  (If you have another version of Visual Studio or Visual C++ installed and wish
  to use its tools from the command line, run vcvars32.bat for that version.)

Do not untar this distribution in a directory with spaces.  This will not work.

    i.e. C:\Program Files\ORacle\DBD Oracle Distribution is bad while
    c:\dev\dbd-oracle-1.15 is good ;)

9/14/02 -- Michael Chase

Makefile.PL uses Win32::TieRegistry or Win32::Registry to find the
current Oracle Home directory if the ORACLE_HOME environment variable
is not set.  If neither module is installed, you must set ORACLE_HOME
before running Makefile.PL.  Since the registry location of the current
Oracle Home is in different locations in different Oracle versions,
it is usually safer to set ORACLE_HOME before running Makefile.PL.
