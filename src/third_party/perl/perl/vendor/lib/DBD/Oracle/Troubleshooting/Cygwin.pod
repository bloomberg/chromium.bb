DBD::Oracle::Troubleshooting::Cygwin - Tips and Hints to Troubleshoot DBD::Oracle on Cygwin

=head1 VERSION

version 1.76

=head1 General Info

Makefile.PL should find and make use of OCI include
files, but you have to build an import library for
OCI.DLL and put it somewhere in library search path.
one of the possible ways to do this is issuing command

    dlltool --input-def oci.def --output-lib liboci.a

in the directory where you unpacked DBD::Oracle distribution
archive.  this will create import library for Oracle 8.0.4.

Note: make clean removes '*.a' files, so put a copy in a safe place.

=head1 Compiling DBD::Oracle using the Oracle Instant Client, Cygwin Perl and gcc

=over

=item 1

Download these two packages from Oracle's Instant Client for
Windows site
(http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/tech/oci/instantclient/htdocs/winsoft.html):

Instant Client Package - Basic: All files required to run OCI,
OCCI, and JDBC-OCI applications

Instant Client Package - SDK: Additional header files and an
example makefile for developing Oracle applications with Instant Client

(I usually just use the latest version of the client)

=item 2

Unpack both into C:\oracle\instantclient_11_1

=item 3

Download and unpack DBD::Oracle from CPAN to some place with no
spaces in the path (I used /tmp/DBD-Oracle) and cd to it.

=item 4

Set up some environment variables (it didn't work until I got the
DSN right):

      ORACLE_DSN=DBI:Oracle:host=oraclehost;sid=oracledb1
      ORACLE_USERID=username/password

=item 5

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

=back

Note, the TNS Names stuff doesn't always seem to work with the instant
client so Perl scripts need to explicitly use host/sid in the DSN, like
this:

    my $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:Oracle:host=oraclehost;sid=oracledb1',
    'username', 'password');
