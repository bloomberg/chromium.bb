version 1.74

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use alienfile;
 plugin 'Extract::CommandLine' => (
   format => 'tar.gz',
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Note: in most case you will want to use L<Alien::Build::Plugin::Extract::Negotiate>
instead.  It picks the appropriate Extract plugin based on your platform and environment.
In some cases you may need to use this plugin directly instead.

This plugin extracts from an archive in various formats using command line tools.

=head1 PROPERTIES

=head2 format

Gives a hint as to the expected format.

=head2 gzip_cmd

The C<gzip> command, if available.  C<undef> if not available.

=head2 bzip2_cmd

The C<bzip2> command, if available.  C<undef> if not available.

=head2 xz_cmd

The C<xz> command, if available.  C<undef> if not available.

=head2 tar_cmd

The C<tar> command, if available.  C<undef> if not available.

=head2 unzip_cmd

The C<unzip> command, if available.  C<undef> if not available.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 handles

 Alien::Build::Plugin::Extract::CommandLine->handles($ext);
 $plugin->handles($ext);

Returns true if the plugin is able to handle the archive of the
given format.

=head2 available

 Alien::Build::Plugin::Extract::CommandLine->available($ext);

Returns true if the plugin is available to extract without
installing anything new.
