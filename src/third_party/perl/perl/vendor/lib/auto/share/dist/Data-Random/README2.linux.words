# As noted in README.linux.words, extreme care was taken to be sure that
# the linux.words list was free of copyright.  This was done so that
# linux.words would be a suitable /usr/dict/words replacement for the Linux
# community.  After the initial release of linux.words, Greg Alt
# (galt@asylum.cs.utah.edu) and Josh Richardson (josh@gatelink.com) sent me
# several short lists of words that were not in my original list.  They
# obtained these lists by analyzing FAQs and online text material,
# including the Federalist Papers.  The results were manually analyzed by
# them before sending the lists to me.  In addition, I removed some words
# which were not listed in The American Heritage Dictionary (Second College
# Edition, Houghton Mifflin Co., 1991).  This method of obtaining words
# (from documents, not from word lists) is also "safe" from the copyright
# standpoint.  Therefore, I am merging these lists in with (version 1) of
# linux.words to create the second version of linux.words.

# move version 1 list
mv linux.words dict.4

# add in proper names (use sort twice to get uppercase before lowercase)
cat dict.4 extra.words | sort | sort -df | uniq > linux.words

# clean up
rm dict.4
