=head1 NAME

MojoX::Log::Report - divert log messages into Log::Report 

=head1 INHERITANCE

 MojoX::Log::Report
   is a Mojo::Log

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use MojoX::Log::Report;
  my $log = MojoX::Log::Report->new(%options);
  $app->log($log);  # install logger in the Mojo::App

=head1 DESCRIPTION

[Included since Log::Report v1.00]
Mojo likes to log messages directly into a file, by default.  Log::Report
constructs a L<Log::Report::Exception|Log::Report::Exception> object first.

Be aware that this extension does catch the messages to be logged,
but that the dispatching of the error follows a different route now.
For instance, you cannot use C<$ENV{MOJO_LOG_LEVEL}> to control the output
level, but you need to use L<Log::Report::dispatcher()|Log::Report/"Report Production and Configuration"> action C<mode>.

Mojo defines five "levels" of messages, which map onto Log::Report's
reasons this way:

  debug  TRACE
  info   INFO
  warn   WARNING
  error  ERROR
  fatal  ALERT
