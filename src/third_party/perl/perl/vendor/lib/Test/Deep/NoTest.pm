=head1 NAME

Test::Deep::NoTest - Use Test::Deep outside of the testing framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::Deep::NoTest;

  if (eq_deeply($a, $b)) {
    print "they were deeply equal\n";
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This exports all the same things as Test::Deep but it does not load
Test::Builder so it can be used in ordinary non-test situations.
