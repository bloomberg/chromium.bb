=head1 NAME

DateTime::TimeZone::Floating - A time zone that is always local

=head1 VERSION

version 2.35

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $floating_tz = DateTime::TimeZone::Floating->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to provide the DateTime::TimeZone API needed by
DateTime.pm, but for floating times, as defined by the RFC 2445 spec.
A floating time has no time zone, and has an effective offset of zero.

=head1 USAGE

This class has the same methods as a real time zone object. The
C<short_name_for_datetime()> method returns the string "floating" and the
C<category()> method returns C<undef>.

=head1 SUPPORT
