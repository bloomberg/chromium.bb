=head1 NAME

DateTime::TimeZone::UTC - The UTC time zone

=head1 VERSION

version 2.35

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $utc_tz = DateTime::TimeZone::UTC->new;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used to provide the DateTime::TimeZone API needed by
DateTime.pm for the UTC time zone, which is not explicitly included in
the Olson time zone database.

The offset for this object will always be zero.

=head1 USAGE

This class has the same methods as a real time zone object, but the
C<category()> method returns undef and C<is_utc()> returns true.

=head1 SUPPORT

Bugs may be submitted at L<https://github.com/houseabsolute/DateTime-TimeZone/issues>.

I am also usually active on IRC as 'autarch' on C<irc://irc.perl.org>.
