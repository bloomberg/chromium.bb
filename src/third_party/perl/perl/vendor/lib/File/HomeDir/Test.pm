=head1 NAME

File::HomeDir::Test - Prevent the accidental creation of user-owned files during testing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::More test => 1;
  use File::HomeDir::Test;
  use File::HomeDir;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<File::HomeDir::Test> is a L<File::HomeDir> driver intended for use in the test scripts
of modules or applications that write files into user-owned directories.

It is designed to prevent the pollution of user directories with files that are not part
of the application install itself, but were created during testing. These files can leak
state information from the tests into the run-time usage of an application, and on Unix
systems also prevents tests (which may be executed as root via sudo) from writing files
which cannot later be modified or removed by the regular user.

=head1 SUPPORT

See the support section of the main L<File::HomeDir> documentation.
