=head1 NAME

B::Hooks::EndOfScope::XS - Execute code after a scope finished compilation - XS implementation

=head1 VERSION

version 0.24

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the implementation of L<B::Hooks::EndOfScope> based on
L<Variable::Magic>, which is an XS module dependent on a compiler. It will
always be automatically preferred if L<Variable::Magic> is available.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 on_scope_end

    on_scope_end { ... };

    on_scope_end $code;

Registers C<$code> to be executed after the surrounding scope has been
compiled.

This is exported by default. See L<Sub::Exporter> on how to customize it.
