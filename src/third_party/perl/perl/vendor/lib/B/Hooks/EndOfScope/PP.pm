=head1 NAME

B::Hooks::EndOfScope::PP - Execute code after a scope finished compilation - PP implementation

=head1 VERSION

version 0.24

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the pure-perl implementation of L<B::Hooks::EndOfScope> based only on
modules available as part of the perl core. Its leaner sibling
L<B::Hooks::EndOfScope::XS> will be automatically preferred if all
dependencies are available and C<$ENV{B_HOOKS_ENDOFSCOPE_IMPLEMENTATION}> is
not set to C<'PP'>.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 on_scope_end

    on_scope_end { ... };

    on_scope_end $code;

Registers C<$code> to be executed after the surrounding scope has been
compiled.

This is exported by default. See L<Sub::Exporter> on how to customize it.
