=head1 NAME

Crypt::Twofish - The Twofish Encryption Algorithm

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Crypt::Twofish;

$cipher = Crypt::Twofish->new($key);

$ciphertext = $cipher->encrypt($plaintext);

$plaintext  = $cipher->decrypt($ciphertext);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Twofish is a 128-bit symmetric block cipher with a variable length (128,
192, or 256-bit) key, developed by Counterpane Labs. It is unpatented
and free for all uses, as described at
<URL:http://www.counterpane.com/twofish.html>.

This module implements Twofish encryption. It supports the Crypt::CBC
interface, with the functions described below. It also provides an
interface that is call-compatible with Crypt::Twofish 1.0, but its use
in new code is strongly discouraged.

=head2 Functions

=over

=item blocksize

Returns the size (in bytes) of the block (16, in this case).

=item keysize

Returns the size (in bytes) of the key. Although the module understands
128, 192, and 256-bit keys, it returns 16 for compatibility with
Crypt::CBC.

=item new($key)

This creates a new Crypt::Twofish object with the specified key (which
should be 16, 24, or 32 bytes long).

=item encrypt($data)

Encrypts blocksize() bytes of $data and returns the corresponding
ciphertext.

=item decrypt($data)

Decrypts blocksize() bytes of $data and returns the corresponding
plaintext.

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

Crypt::CBC, Crypt::Blowfish, Crypt::TEA

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

=over 4

=item Nishant Kakani

For writing Crypt::Twofish 1.0 (this version is a complete rewrite).

=item Tony Cook

For making the module work under Activeperl, testing on several
platforms, and suggesting that I probe for features via %Config.
