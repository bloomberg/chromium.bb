=head1 NAME

Template::Tools::tpage - Process templates from command line

=head1 USAGE

    tpage [ --define var=value ] file(s)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<tpage> script is a simple wrapper around the Template Toolkit processor.
Files specified by name on the command line are processed in turn by the 
template processor and the resulting output is sent to STDOUT and can be 
redirected accordingly.  e.g.

    tpage myfile > myfile.out
    tpage header myfile footer > myfile.html

If no file names are specified on the command line then B<tpage> will read
STDIN for input.

The C<--define> option can be used to set the values of template variables.
e.g.

    tpage --define author="Andy Wardley" skeleton.pm > MyModule.pm

=head2 The F<.tpagerc> Configuration File

You can use a F<.tpagerc> file in your home directory.

The purpose of this file is to set any I<global> configuration options
that you want applied I<every> time F<tpage> is run. For example, you
can use the C<include_path> to use template files from a generic template
directory.

Run C<tpage -h> for a summary of the options available.

See L<Template> for general information about the Perl Template 
Toolkit and the template language and features.
