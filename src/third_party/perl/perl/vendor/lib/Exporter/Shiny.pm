=head1 NAME

Exporter::Shiny - shortcut for Exporter::Tiny

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Exporter::Shiny qw( foo bar );

Is a shortcut for:

   use base "Exporter::Tiny";
   push our(@EXPORT_OK), qw( foo bar );

For compatibility with L<Sub::Exporter>, the following longer syntax is
also supported:

   use Exporter::Shiny -setup => {
      exports => [qw( foo bar )],
   };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a very small wrapper to simplify using L<Exporter::Tiny>.

It does the following:

=over

=item * Marks your package as loaded in C<< %INC >>;

=item * Pushes any function names in the import list onto your C<< @EXPORT_OK >>; and

=item * Pushes C<< "Exporter::Tiny" >> onto your C<< @ISA >>.

=back

It doesn't set up C<< %EXPORT_TAGS >> or C<< @EXPORT >>, but there's
nothing stopping you doing that yourself.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs to
L<http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=Exporter-Tiny>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This module is just a wrapper around L<Exporter::Tiny>, so take a look
at L<Exporter::Tiny::Manual::QuickStart> and
L<Exporter::Tiny::Manual::Exporting> for further information on what
features are available.

Other interesting exporters: L<Sub::Exporter>, L<Exporter>.
