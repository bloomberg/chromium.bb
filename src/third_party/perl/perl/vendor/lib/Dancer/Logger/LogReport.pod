=head1 NAME

Dancer::Logger::LogReport - reroute Dancer logs into Log::Report

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Dancer::Logger::LogReport
   is a Dancer::Logger::Abstract

 Dancer::Logger::LogReport
   is a Exporter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # When your main program is not a Dancer object
  use My::Dancer::App;
  use Log::Report;
  ... start dispatcher ...
  error "something is wrong";   # Log::Report::error()

  # When your main program is a Dancer object
  use Dancer;
  use Dancer::Logger::LogReport;
  use Log::Report import => 'dispatcher';
  ... start dispatcher ...
  error "something is wrong";   # Dancer::error()

  # In any case, your main program needs to start log dispatcers
  # Both Dancer and other Log::Report based modules will send
  # their messages here:
  dispatcher FILE => 'default', ...;

  # In your config
  logger: log_report
  logger_format: %i%m   # keep it simple
  log: debug            # filtered by dispatchers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<Log::Report|Log::Report> exception/translation framework defines a large
number of logging back-ends.  The same log messages can be sent to 
multiple destinations at the same time via flexible dispatchers.
When you use this logger in your Dancer application, it will nicely
integrate with non-Dancer modules which need logging.

Many log back-ends, like syslog, have more levels of system messages.
Modules who explicitly load this module can use the missing C<assert>,
C<notice>, C<panic>, and C<alert> log levels.  The C<trace> name is
provided as well: when you are debugging, you add a 'trace' to your
program... its just a better name than 'debug'.

You probably want to set a very simple C<logger_format>, because the
dispatchers do already add some of the fields that the default
C<simple> format adds.  For instance, to get the filename/line-number 
in messages depends on the dispatcher 'mode' (f.i. 'DEBUG').

You also want to set the log level to C<debug>, because level filtering
is controlled per dispatcher (as well)
