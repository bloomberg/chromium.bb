=head1 NAME

Math::GMP - High speed arbitrary size integer math

=head1 VERSION

version 2.19

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::GMP;
  my $n = Math::GMP->new('2');

  $n = $n ** (256*1024);
  $n = $n - 1;
  print "n is now $n\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Math::GMP was designed to be a drop-in replacement both for
Math::BigInt and for regular integer arithmetic.  Unlike BigInt,
though, Math::GMP uses the GNU gmp library for all of its
calculations, as opposed to straight Perl functions.  This can result
in speed improvements.

The downside is that this module requires a C compiler to install -- a
small tradeoff in most cases. Also, this module is not 100% compatible
with Math::BigInt.

A Math::GMP object can be used just as a normal numeric scalar would
be -- the module overloads most of the normal arithmetic operators to
provide as seamless an interface as possible. However, if you need a
perfect interface, you can do the following:

  use Math::GMP qw(:constant);

  $n = 2 ** (256 * 1024);
  print "n is $n\n";

This would fail without the ':constant' since Perl would use normal
doubles to compute the 250,000 bit number, and thereby overflow it
into meaninglessness (smaller exponents yield less accurate data due
to floating point rounding).

=head2 legendre

  $x = Math::GMP->new(6);

1 if it may be, and 2 if it definitely is a prime.

=head2 $x->add_ui_gmp($n)

=head1 BUGS

As of version 1.0, Math::GMP is mostly compatible with the old
Math::BigInt version. It is not a full replacement for the rewritten
Math::BigInt versions, though. See the L<SEE ALSO section|SEE ALSO>
on how to achieve to use Math::GMP and retain full compatibility to
Math::BigInt.

There are some slight incompatibilities, such as output of positive
numbers not being prefixed by a '+' sign.  This is intentional.

There are also some things missing, and not everything might work as
expected.

=head1 VERSION CONTROL

The version control repository of this module is a git repository hosted
on GitHub at: L<https://github.com/turnstep/Math-GMP>. Pull requests are
welcome.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Math::BigInt has a new interface to use a different library than the
default pure Perl implementation. You can use, for instance, Math::GMP
with it:

  use Math::BigInt lib => 'GMP';

If Math::GMP is not installed, it will fall back to its own Perl
implementation.

See L<Math::BigInt> and L<Math::BigInt::GMP> or
L<Math::BigInt::Pari> or L<Math::BigInt::BitVect>.
