=head1 NAME

Specio::Constraint::Structured - A class which represents structured constraints

=head1 VERSION

version 0.43

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $tuple = t('Tuple');

    my $tuple_of_str_int = $tuple->parameterize( of => [ t('Str'), t('Int') ] );

    my $parent = $tuple_of_str_int->parent; # returns Tuple
    my $parameters = $arrayref_of_int->parameters; # returns { of => [ t('Str'), t('Int') ] }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements the API for structured types.

=for Pod::Coverage can_be_inlined type_parameter

=head1 API

This class implements the same API as L<Specio::Constraint::Simple>, with a few
additions.

=head2 Specio::Constraint::Structured->new(...)

This class's constructor accepts two additional parameters:

=over 4

=item * parent

This should be the L<Specio::Constraint::Structurable> object from which this
object was created.

This parameter is required.

=item * parameters

This is the hashref of parameters for the structured type. These are the
parameters returned by the C<Structurable> type's
C<parameterization_args_builder>. The exact form of this hashref will vary for
each structured type.

This parameter is required.

=back

=head2 $type->parameters

Returns the hashref that was passed to the constructor.
