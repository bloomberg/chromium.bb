=head1 NAME

Specio::Constraint::ObjectDoes - A class for constraints which require an object that does a specific role

=head1 VERSION

version 0.43

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $type = Specio::Constraint::ObjectDoes->new(...);
    print $type->role;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a specialized type constraint class for types which require an object
that does a specific role.

=head1 API

This class provides all of the same methods as L<Specio::Constraint::Simple>,
with a few differences:

=head2 Specio::Constraint::ObjectDoes->new( ... )

The C<parent> parameter is ignored if it passed, as it is always set to the
C<Defined> type.

The C<inline_generator> and C<constraint> parameters are also ignored. This
class provides its own default inline generator subroutine reference.

This class overrides the C<message_generator> default if none is provided.

Finally, this class requires an additional parameter, C<role>. This must be a
single role name.

=head2 $object_isa->role

Returns the role name passed to the constructor.

=head1 ROLES

This class does the L<Specio::Constraint::Role::DoesType>,
L<Specio::Constraint::Role::Interface>, and L<Specio::Role::Inlinable> roles.
