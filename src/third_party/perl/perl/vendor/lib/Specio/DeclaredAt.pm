=head1 NAME

Specio::DeclaredAt - A class to represent where a type or coercion was declared

=head1 VERSION

version 0.43

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $declared = Specio::DeclaredAt->new_from_caller(1);

    print $declared->description;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a thin wrapper around some of the return values from
Perl's C<caller> built-in. It's used internally to identify where types and
coercions are being declared, which is useful when generating error messages.

=head1 API

This class provides the following methods.

=head2 Specio::DeclaredAt->new_from_caller($depth)

Given a call stack depth, this method returns a new C<Specio::DeclaredAt>
object.

=head2 $declared_at->package, $declared_at->filename, $declared_at->line

Returns the call stack information recorded when the object was created. These
values are always populated.

=head2 $declared_at->subroutine

Returns the subroutine from the call stack. This may be an C<udnef>

=head2 $declared_at->has_subroutine

Returns true if there is a subroutine name associated with this object.

=head2 $declared_at->description

Puts all the information together into a single string like "declared in
package Foo::Bar (.../Foo/Bar.pm) at line 42 in sub named blah".
