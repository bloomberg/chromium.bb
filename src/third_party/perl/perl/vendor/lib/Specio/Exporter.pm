=head1 NAME

Specio::Exporter - Base class for type libraries

=head1 VERSION

version 0.43

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyApp::Type::Library;

    use parent 'Specio::Exporter';

    use Specio::Declare;

    declare( ... );

    # more types here

    package MyApp::Foo;

    use MyApp::Type::Library

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Inheriting from this package makes your package a type exporter. By default,
types defined in a package are never visible outside of the package. When you
inherit from this package, all the types you define internally become
available via exports.

The exported types are available through the importing package's C<t>
subroutine.

By default, types your package imports are not re-exported:

  package MyApp::Type::Library;

  use parent 'Specio::Exporter';

  use Specio::Declare;
  use Specio::Library::Builtins;

In this case, the types provided by L<Specio::Library::Builtins> are not
exported to packages which C<use MyApp::Type::Library>.

You can explicitly ask for types to be re-exported:

  package MyApp::Type::Library;

  use parent 'Specio::Exporter';

  use Specio::Declare;
  use Specio::Library::Builtins -reexport;

In this case, packages which C<use MyApp::Type::Library> will get all the
types from L<Specio::Library::Builtins> as well as any types defined in
C<MyApp::Type::Library>.

=head1 ADDITIONAL EXPORTS

If you want to export some additional subroutines from a package which has
C<Specio::Exporter> as its parent, define a sub named C<_also_export>. This
sub should return a I<list> of subroutines defined in your package that should
also be exported. These subs will be exported unconditionally to any package
that uses your package.

=head1 COMBINING LIBRARIES WITH L<Specio::Subs>

You can combine loading libraries with subroutine generation using
L<Specio::Subs> by using C<_also_export> and
C<Specio::Subs::subs_installed_into>:

    package My::Library;

    use My::Library::Internal -reexport;
    use Specio::Library::Builtins -reexport;
    use Specio::Subs qw( My::Library::Internal Specio::Library::Builtins );

    sub _also_export {
        return Specio::Subs::subs_installed_into(__PACKAGE__);
    }
