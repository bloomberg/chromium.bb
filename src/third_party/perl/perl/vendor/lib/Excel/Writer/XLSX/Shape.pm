=head1 NAME

Shape - A class for creating Excel Drawing shapes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To create a simple Excel file containing shapes using L<Excel::Writer::XLSX>:

    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Excel::Writer::XLSX;

    my $workbook  = Excel::Writer::XLSX->new( 'shape.xlsx' );
    my $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet();

    # Add a default rectangle shape.
    my $rect = $workbook->add_shape();

    # Add an ellipse with centered text.
    my $ellipse = $workbook->add_shape(
        type => 'ellipse',
        text => "Hello\nWorld"
    );

    # Add a plus shape.
    my $plus = $workbook->add_shape( type => 'plus');

    # Insert the shapes in the worksheet.
    $worksheet->insert_shape( 'B3', $rect );
    $worksheet->insert_shape( 'C3', $ellipse );
    $worksheet->insert_shape( 'D3', $plus );


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Excel::Writer::XLSX::Shape> module is used to create Shape objects for L<Excel::Writer::XLSX>.

A Shape object is created via the Workbook C<add_shape()> method:

    my $shape_rect = $workbook->add_shape( type => 'rect' );

Once the object is created it can be inserted into a worksheet using the C<insert_shape()> method:

    $worksheet->insert_shape('A1', $shape_rect);

A Shape can be inserted multiple times if required.

    $worksheet->insert_shape('A1', $shape_rect);
    $worksheet->insert_shape('B2', $shape_rect, 20, 30);


=head1 METHODS

=head2 add_shape( %properties )

The C<add_shape()> Workbook method specifies the properties of the Shape in hash C<< property => value >> format:

    my $shape = $workbook->add_shape( %properties );

The available properties are shown below.

=head2 insert_shape( $row, $col, $shape, $x, $y, $scale_x, $scale_y )

The C<insert_shape()> Worksheet method sets the location and scale of the shape object within the worksheet.

    # Insert the shape into the worksheet.
    $worksheet->insert_shape( 'E2', $shape );

Using the cell location and the C<$x> and C<$y> cell offsets it is possible to position a shape anywhere on the canvas of a worksheet.

A more detailed explanation of the C<insert_shape()> method is given in the main L<Excel::Writer::XLSX> documentation.


=head1 SHAPE PROPERTIES

Any shape property can be queried or modified by the corresponding get/set method:

    my $ellipse = $workbook->add_shape( %properties );
    $ellipse->set_type( 'plus' );    # No longer an ellipse!
    my $type = $ellipse->get_type();  # Find out what it really is.

Multiple shape properties may also be modified in one go by using the C<set_properties()> method:

    $shape->set_properties( type => 'ellipse', text => 'Hello' );

The properties of a shape object that can be defined via C<add_shape()> are shown below.

=head2 name

Defines the name of the shape. This is an optional property and the shape will be given a default name if not supplied. The name is generally only used by Excel Macros to refer to the object.

=head2 type

Defines the type of the object such as C<rect>, C<ellipse> or C<triangle>:

    my $ellipse = $workbook->add_shape( type => 'ellipse' );

The default type is C<rect>.

The full list of available shapes is shown below.

See also the C<shapes_all.pl> program in the C<examples> directory of the distro. It creates an example workbook with all supported shapes labelled with their shape names.

=back

=head2 text

This property is used to make the shape act like a text box.

    my $rect = $workbook->add_shape( type => 'rect', text => "Hello\nWorld" );

The text is super-imposed over the shape. The text can be wrapped using the newline character C<\n>.

=head2 id

Identification number for internal identification. This number will be auto-assigned, if not assigned, or if it is a duplicate.

=head2 format

Workbook format for decorating the shape text (font family, size, and decoration).

=head2 start, start_index

Shape indices of the starting point for a connector and the index of the connection. Index numbers are zero-based, start from the top dead centre and are counted clockwise.

Indices are typically created for vertices and centre points of shapes. They are the blue connection points that appear when connection shapes are selected manually in Excel.

=head2 end, end_index

Same as above but for end points and end connections.


=head2 start_side, end_side

This is either the letter C<b> or C<r> for the bottom or right side of the shape to be connected to and from.

If the C<start>, C<start_index>, and C<start_side> parameters are defined for a connection shape, the shape will be auto located and linked to the starting and ending shapes respectively. This can be very useful for flow and organisation charts.

=head2 flip_h, flip_v

Set this value to 1, to flip the shape horizontally and/or vertically.

=head2 rotation

Shape rotation, in degrees, from 0 to 360.

=head2 line, fill

Shape colour for the outline and fill. Colours may be specified as a colour index, or in RGB format, i.e. C<AA00FF>.

See C<COLOURS IN EXCEL> in the main documentation for more information.

=head2 line_type

Line type for shape outline. The default is solid. The list of possible values is:

    dash, sysDot, dashDot, lgDash, lgDashDot, lgDashDotDot, solid

=head2 valign, align

Text alignment within the shape.

Vertical alignment can be:

    Setting     Meaning
    =======     =======
    t           Top
    ctr         Centre
    b           Bottom

Horizontal alignment can be:

    Setting     Meaning
    =======     =======
    l           Left
    r           Right
    ctr         Centre
    just        Justified

The default is to centre both horizontally and vertically.

=head2 scale_x, scale_y

Scale factor in x and y dimension, for scaling the shape width and height. The default value is 1.

Scaling may be set on the shape object or via C<insert_shape()>.

=head2 adjustments

Adjustment of shape vertices. Most shapes do not use this. For some shapes, there is a single adjustment to modify the geometry. For instance, the plus shape has one adjustment to control the width of the spokes.

Connectors can have a number of adjustments to control the shape routing. Typically, a connector will have 3 to 5 handles for routing the shape. The adjustment is in percent of the distance from the starting shape to the ending shape, alternating between the x and y dimension. Adjustments may be negative, to route the shape away from the endpoint.

=head2 stencil

Shapes work in stencil mode by default. That is, once a shape is inserted, its connection is separated from its master. The master shape may be modified after an instance is inserted, and only subsequent insertions will show the modifications.

This is helpful for Org charts, where an employee shape may be created once, and then the text of the shape is modified for each employee.

The C<insert_shape()> method returns a reference to the inserted shape (the child).

Stencil mode can be turned off, allowing for shape(s) to be modified after insertion. In this case the C<insert_shape()> method returns a reference to the inserted shape (the master). This is not very useful for inserting multiple shapes, since the x/y coordinates also gets modified.

=head1 TIPS

Use C<< $worksheet->hide_gridlines(2) >> to prepare a blank canvas without gridlines.

Shapes do not need to fit on one page. Excel will split a large drawing into multiple pages if required. Use the page break preview to show page boundaries superimposed on the drawing.

Connected shapes will auto-locate in Excel if you move either the starting shape or the ending shape separately. However, if you select both shapes (lasso or control-click), the connector will move with it, and the shape adjustments will not re-calculate.

=head1 EXAMPLE

    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Excel::Writer::XLSX;

    my $workbook  = Excel::Writer::XLSX->new( 'shape.xlsx' );
    my $worksheet = $workbook->add_worksheet();

    # Add a default rectangle shape.
    my $rect = $workbook->add_shape();

    # Add an ellipse with centered text.
    my $ellipse = $workbook->add_shape(
        type => 'ellipse',
        text => "Hello\nWorld"
    );

    # Add a plus shape.
    my $plus = $workbook->add_shape( type => 'plus');

    # Insert the shapes in the worksheet.
    $worksheet->insert_shape( 'B3', $rect );
    $worksheet->insert_shape( 'C3', $ellipse );
    $worksheet->insert_shape( 'D3', $plus );

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item * Add shapes which have custom geometries.

=item * Provide better integration of workbook formats for shapes.

=item * Add further validation of shape properties to prevent creation of workbooks that will not open.

=item * Auto connect shapes that are not anchored to cell A1.

=item * Add automatic shape connection to shape vertices besides the object centre.

=item * Improve automatic shape connection to shapes with concave sides (e.g. chevron).
