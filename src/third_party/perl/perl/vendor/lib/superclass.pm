=head1 NAME

superclass - Like parent, but with version checks

=head1 VERSION

version 0.003

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Baz;
    use superclass qw(Foo Bar), 'Baz' => 1.23;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Allows you to both load one or more modules, while setting up inheritance from
those modules at the same time.

If a module in the import list is followed by something that doesn't look like
a legal module name, the C<VERSION> method will be called with it as an argument;

The synopsis example is mostly similar in effect to

    package Baz;
    BEGIN {
        require Foo;
        require Bar;
        require Baz;
        Baz->VERSION(1.23)
        push @ISA, qw(Foo Bar Baz);
    }

Dotted-decimal versions should be given as a string, not a raw v-string, and
must include at least one decimal point.

    use superclass 'Bar' => v65.65.65; # BAD: loads AAA.pm

    use superclass 'Bar' => 'v6';      # BAD: loads v6.pm

    use superclass 'Foo' => 'v0.10.0'; # OK

If the first import argument is C<-norequire>, no files will be loaded
(but any versions given will still be checked).

This is helpful for the case where a package lives within the current file
or a differently named file:

  package MyHash;
  use Tie::Hash;
  use superclass -norequire, 'Tie::StdHash';

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item Class 'Foo' tried to inherit from itself

Attempting to inherit from yourself generates a warning.

    package Foo;
    use superclass 'Foo';

=head1 HISTORY

This module was forked from L<parent> to add version checks.
The L<parent> module was forked from L<base> to remove the cruft
that had accumulated in it.

Authors of or contributors to predecessor modules include RafaÃ«l Garcia-Suarez,
Bart Lateur, Max Maischein, Anno Siegel, and Michael Schwern
