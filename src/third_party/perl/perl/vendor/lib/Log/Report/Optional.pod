=head1 NAME

Log::Report::Optional - pick Log::Report or ::Minimal

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Log::Report::Optional
   is a Exporter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # Use Log::Report when already loaded, otherwise Log::Report::Minimal
 package My::Package;
 use Log::Report::Optional 'my-domain';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module will allow libraries (helper modules) to have a dependency
to a small module instead of the full Log-Report distribution.  The full
power of C<Log::Report> is only released when the main program uses that
module.  In that case, the module using the 'Optional' will also use the
full Log::Report, otherwise the dressed-down L<Log::Report::Minimal|Log::Report::Minimal>
version.

For the full documentation:

=over 4

=item * see Log::Report when it is used by main

=item * see L<Log::Report::Minimal|Log::Report::Minimal> otherwise

=back

The latter provides the same functions from the former, but is the
simpelest possible way.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item Log::Report::Optional-E<gt>B<usedBy>()

Returns the classes which loaded the optional module.
