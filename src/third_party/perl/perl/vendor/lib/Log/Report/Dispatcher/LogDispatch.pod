=head1 NAME

Log::Report::Dispatcher::LogDispatch - send messages to Log::Dispatch back-end

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Log::Report::Dispatcher::LogDispatch
   is a Log::Report::Dispatcher

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Log::Dispatch::File;
 dispatcher Log::Dispatch::File => 'logger', accept => 'NOTICE-'
   , filename => 'logfile', to_level => [ 'ALERT-' => 'err' ];

 # disable default dispatcher
 dispatcher close => 'logger';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This dispatchers produces output to and C<Log::Dispatch> back-end.
(which will NOT be automatically installed for you).

The REASON for a message often uses names which are quite similar to the
log-levels used by Log::Dispatch.  However: they have a different
approach.  The REASON of Log::Report limits the responsibility of the
programmer to indicate the cause of the message: whether it was able to
handle a certain situation.  The Log::Dispatch levels are there for the
user's of the program.  However: the programmer does not known anything
about the application (in the general case).  This is cause of much of
the trickery in Perl programs.

The default translation table is list below.  You can change the mapping
using L<new(to_level)|Log::Report::Dispatcher::LogDispatch/"Constructors">.  See example in SYNOPSIS.

The Log::Dispatch infrastructure has quite a large number of output
TYPEs, each extending the Log::Dispatch::Output base-class.  You
do not create these objects yourself: Log::Report is doing it for you.

The Log::Dispatch back-ends are very careful with validating their
parameters, so you will need to restrict the options to what is supported
for the specific back-end.  See their respective manual-pages.  The errors
produced by the back-ends quite horrible and untranslated, sorry.

See Log::Dispatch::Output.

=item charset => CHARSET

=item format_reason => 'UPPERCASE'|'LOWERCASE'|'UCFIRST'|'IGNORE'|CODE

=item locale => LOCALE

=item max_level => LEVEL

Like C<min_level>.

=item min_level => LEVEL

Restrict the messages which are passed through based on the LEVEL,
so after the reason got translated into a Log::Dispatch compatible
LEVEL.  The default will use Log::Report restrictions only.
