=head1 NAME

Log::Report::Die - compatibility routines with Perl's die/croak/confess

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Log::Report::Die
   is a Exporter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 # use internally only

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is used internally, to translate output of 'die' and Carp
functions into L<Log::Report::Message|Log::Report::Message> objects.  Also, it tries to
convert other kinds of exception frameworks into our message object.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item B<die_decode>(STRING, %options)

The STRING is the content of C<$@> after an eval() caught a die().
croak(), or confess().  This routine tries to convert this into
parameters for L<Log::Report::report()|Log::Report/"Report Production and Configuration">.  This is done in a very
smart way, even trying to find the stringifications of C<$!>.

Return are four elements: the error string which is used to trigger
a C<Log::Report> compatible C<die()>, and the options, reason, and
text message.  The options is a HASH which, amongst other things,
may contain a stack trace and location.

Translated components will have exception classes C<perl>, and C<die> or
C<confess>.  On the moment, the C<croak> cannot be distiguished from the
C<confess> (when used in package main) or C<die> (otherwise).

The returned reason depends on whether the translation of the current
C<$!> is found in the STRING, and the presence of a stack trace.  The
following table is used:

  errstr  stack  =>  reason
    no      no       ERROR   (die) application internal problem
    yes     no       FAULT   (die) external problem, think open()
    no      yes      PANIC   (confess) implementation error
    yes     yes      ALERT   (confess) external problem, caught

 -Option--Default
  on_die  'ERROR'

=over 2

=item on_die => REASON

=back

=item B<exception_decode>($exception, %options)

[1.23] This function attempts to translate object of other exception frameworks
into information to create a L<Log::Report::Exception|Log::Report::Exception>.  It returns the
same list of parameters as L<die_decode()|Log::Report::Die/"FUNCTIONS"> does.

Currently supported:

=item * DBIx::Class::Exception

=item * XML::LibXML::Error
