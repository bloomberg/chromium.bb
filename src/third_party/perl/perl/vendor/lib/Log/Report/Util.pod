=head1 NAME

Log::Report::Util - helpful routines to Log::Report

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Log::Report::Util
   is a Exporter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my ($language, $territory, $charset, $modifier)
    = parse_locale 'nl_BE.utf-8@home';

 my @take = expand_reasons 'INFO-ERROR,PANIC';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module collects a few functions and definitions which are shared
between different components in the Log::Report infrastructure.
They should not be needed for end-user applications, although this
man-page may contain some useful background information.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 Reasons

=over 4

=item B<expand_reasons>($reasons)

Returns a sub-set of all existing message reason labels, based on the
content $reasons string. The following rules apply:
 REASONS = BLOCK [ ',' BLOCKS]
 BLOCK   = '-' TO | FROM '-' TO | ONE | SOURCE
 FROM,TO,ONE = 'TRACE' | 'ASSERT' | ,,, | 'PANIC'
 SOURCE  = 'USER' | 'PROGRAM' | 'SYSTEM' | 'ALL'

The SOURCE specification group all reasons which are usually related to
the problem: report about problems caused by the user, reported by
the program, or with system interaction.

example: of expended REASONS

 WARNING-FAULT # == WARNING,MISTAKE,ERROR,FAULT
 -INFO         # == TRACE-INFO
 ALERT-        # == ALERT,FAILURE,PANIC
 USER          # == MISTAKE,ERROR
 ALL           # == TRACE-PANIC

=item B<is_fatal>($reason)

Returns true if the $reason is severe enough to cause an exception
(or program termination).

=item B<is_reason>($name)

Returns true if the STRING is one of the predefined REASONS.

=item B<use_errno>($reason)

=back

=head2 Modes

Run-modes are explained in Log::Report::Dispatcher.

=over 4

=item B<mode_accepts>($mode)

Returns something acceptable by L<expand_reasons()|Log::Report::Util/"Reasons">

=item B<mode_number>($name|$mode)

Returns the $mode as number.

=item B<must_show_location>($mode, $reason)

=item B<must_show_stack>($mode, $reason)

=back

=head2 Other

=over 4

=item B<escape_chars>(STRING)

Replace all escape characters into their readable counterpart.  For
instance, a new-line is replaced by backslash-n.

=item B<parse_locale>(STRING)

Decompose a locale string.

For simplicity of the caller's code, the capatization of the returned
fields is standardized to the preferred, although the match is case-
insensitive as required by the RFC. The territory in returned in capitals
(ISO3166), the language is lower-case (ISO639), the script as upper-case
first, the character-set as lower-case, and the modifier and variant unchanged.

In LIST context, four elements are returned: language, territory,
character-set (codeset), and modifier.  Those four are important for the
usual unix translationg infrastructure.  Only the "country" is obligatory,
the others can be C<undef>.  It may also return C<C> and C<POSIX>.

In SCALAR context, a HASH is returned which can contain more information:
language, script, territory, variant, codeset, and modifiers.  The
variant (RFC3066 is probably never used)

=item B<pkg2domain>( $package, [$domain, $filename, $line] )

With $domain, $filename and $line, this registers a location where the
textdomain is specified.  Each $package can only belong to one $domain.

Without these parameters, the registered domain for the $package is
returned.

=item B<to_html>($string)

[1.02] Escape HTML volatile characters.

=item B<unescape_chars>(STRING)

Replace all backslash-something escapes by their escape character.
For instance, backslash-t is replaced by a tab character.
