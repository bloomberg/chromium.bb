=head1 NAME

IO::Interactive - Utilities for interactive I/O

=head1 VERSION

This document describes IO::Interactive version 0.0.6


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::Interactive qw(is_interactive interactive busy);

    if ( is_interactive() ) {
        print "Running interactively\n";
    }

    # or...

    print {interactive} "Running interactively\n";


    $fh = busy {
        do_noninteractive_stuff();
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides three utility subroutines that make it easier to
develop interactive applications...

=over

=item C<is_interactive()>

This subroutine returns true if C<*ARGV> and the currently selected
filehandle (usually C<*STDOUT>) are connected to the terminal. The 
test is considerably more sophisticated than:

    -t *ARGV && -t *STDOUT

as it takes into account the magic behaviour of C<*ARGV>.

You can also pass C<is_interactive> a writable filehandle, in which case it
requires that filehandle be connected to a terminal (instead of the
currently selected).  The usual suspect here is C<*STDERR>:

    if ( is_interactive(*STDERR) ) {
        carp $warning;
    }


=item C<interactive()>

This subroutine returns C<*STDOUT> if C<is_interactive> is true. If
C<is_interactive()> is false, C<interactive> returns a filehandle that
does not print.

This makes it easy to create applications that print out only when the
application is interactive:

    print {interactive} "Please enter a value: ";
    my $value = <>;

You can also pass C<interactive> a writable filehandle, in which case it
writes to that filehandle if it is connected to a terminal (instead of 
writinbg to C<*STDOUT>). Once again, the usual suspect is C<*STDERR>:

    print {interactive(*STDERR)} $warning;


=item C<busy {...}>

This subroutine takes a block as its single argument and executes that block.
Whilst the block is executed, C<*ARGV> is temporarily replaced by a closed
filehandle. That is, no input from C<*ARGV> is possible in a C<busy> block.
Furthermore, any attempts to send input into the C<busy> block through
C<*ARGV> is intercepted and a warning message is printed to C<*STDERR>.
The C<busy> call returns a filehandle that contains the intercepted input.

A C<busy> block is therefore useful to prevent attempts at input when the
program is busy at some non-interactive task.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item Unknown subroutine (%s) requested

This module only exports the three subroutines described above.
You asked for something else. Maybe you misspelled the subroutine you wanted.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

IO::Interactive requires no configuration files or environment variables.


=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the C<openhandle()> subroutine from the
Scalar::Util module.


=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.
