=head1 NAME

Imager::LargeSamples - track/document large sample support

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # make a large sample image
  my $im = Imager->new(..., bits => 16);

  # call some method
  my $result = $im->$method(...);

  # was the image modified at its full sample size

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Imager has had in-memory support for large samples for years now, but
many methods still don't work at the higher sample size when supplied
with a large sample image.

This document will track which methods support large samples and which
don't, for future improvements.

[1] filling an area using the fill parameter works at the full depth
of the image, using filled => 1 and color works at 8-bits/sample

[2] box() will fill the area at the supplied color, but outline at
8-bits/sample.
