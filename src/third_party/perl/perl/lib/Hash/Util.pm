=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Hash::Util> and C<Hash::Util::FieldHash> contain special functions
for manipulating hashes that don't really warrant a keyword.

C<Hash::Util> contains a set of functions that support
L<restricted hashes|/"Restricted hashes">. These are described in
this document.  C<Hash::Util::FieldHash> contains an (unrelated)
set of functions that support the use of hashes in
I<inside-out classes>, described in L<Hash::Util::FieldHash>.

By default C<Hash::Util> does not export anything.

=head2 Restricted hashes

5.8.0 introduces the ability to restrict a hash to a certain set of
keys.  No keys outside of this set can be added.  It also introduces
the ability to lock an individual key so it cannot be deleted and the
ability to ensure that an individual value cannot be changed.

This is intended to largely replace the deprecated pseudo-hashes.

=item B<lock_keys>

=item B<unlock_keys>

  lock_keys(%hash);
  lock_keys(%hash, @keys);

Restricts the given %hash's set of keys to @keys.  If @keys is not
given it restricts it to its current keyset.  No more keys can be
added. delete() and exists() will still work, but will not alter
the set of allowed keys. B<Note>: the current implementation prevents
the hash from being bless()ed while it is in a locked state. Any attempt
to do so will raise an exception. Of course you can still bless()
the hash before you call lock_keys() so this shouldn't be a problem.

  unlock_keys(%hash);

Removes the restriction on the %hash's keyset.

B<Note> that if any of the values of the hash have been locked they will not be unlocked
after this sub executes.

Both routines return a reference to the hash operated on.

=item B<lock_keys_plus>

  lock_keys_plus(%hash,@additional_keys)

Similar to C<lock_keys()>, with the difference being that the optional key list
specifies keys that may or may not be already in the hash. Essentially this is
an easier way to say

  lock_keys(%hash,@additional_keys,keys %hash);

Returns a reference to %hash

    my ($hash,@keys)=@_;

=item B<lock_value>

=item B<unlock_value>

  lock_value  (%hash, $key);
  unlock_value(%hash, $key);

Locks and unlocks the value for an individual key of a hash.  The value of a
locked key cannot be changed.

Unless %hash has already been locked the key/value could be deleted
regardless of this setting.

Returns a reference to the %hash.

=cut

=item B<lock_hash>

=item B<unlock_hash>

    lock_hash(%hash);

lock_hash() locks an entire hash, making all keys and values read-only.
No value can be changed, no keys can be added or deleted.

    unlock_hash(%hash);

unlock_hash() does the opposite of lock_hash().  All keys and values
are made writable.  All values can be changed and keys can be added
and deleted.

Returns a reference to the %hash.

=cut

sub lock_hashref {
    my $hash = shift;

    lock_ref_keys($hash);

sub   lock_hash (\%) {   lock_hashref(@_) }
sub unlock_hash (\%) { unlock_hashref(@_) }

=item B<lock_hash_recurse>

=item B<unlock_hash_recurse>

    lock_hash_recurse(%hash);

lock_hash() locks an entire hash and any hashes it references recursively,
making all keys and values read-only. No value can be changed, no keys can
be added or deleted.

B<Only> recurses into hashes that are referenced by another hash. Thus a
Hash of Hashes (HoH) will all be restricted, but a Hash of Arrays of Hashes
(HoAoH) will only have the top hash restricted.

    unlock_hash_recurse(%hash);

unlock_hash_recurse() does the opposite of lock_hash_recurse().  All keys and
values are made writable.  All values can be changed and keys can be added
and deleted. Identical recursion restrictions apply as to lock_hash_recurse().

Returns a reference to the %hash.

=cut

sub lock_hashref_recurse {
    my $hash = shift;

    lock_ref_keys($hash);
    foreach my $value (values %$hash) {
        my $type = reftype($value);
        if (defined($type) and $type eq 'HASH') {
            lock_hashref_recurse($value);

=item B<hash_unlocked>

  hash_unlocked(%hash) and print "Hash is unlocked!\n";

Returns true if the hash and its keys are unlocked.

=cut

sub hashref_unlocked {
    my $hash=shift;
    return Internals::SvREADONLY($hash)
}

sub hash_unlocked(\%) { hashref_unlocked(@_) }

=cut

sub legal_keys(\%) { legal_ref_keys(@_)  }
sub hidden_keys(\%){ hidden_ref_keys(@_) }

=item B<legal_keys>

  my @keys = legal_keys(%hash);

Returns the list of the keys that are legal in a restricted hash.
In the case of an unrestricted hash this is identical to calling
keys(%hash).

=item B<hidden_keys>

  my @keys = hidden_keys(%hash);

Returns the list of the keys that are legal in a restricted hash but
do not have a value associated to them. Thus if 'foo' is a
"hidden" key of the %hash it will return false for both C<defined>
and C<exists> tests.

In the case of an unrestricted hash this will return an empty list.

B<NOTE> this is an experimental feature that is heavily dependent
on the current implementation of restricted hashes. Should the
implementation change, this routine may become meaningless, in which
case it will return an empty list.

=item B<all_keys>

  all_keys(%hash,@keys,@hidden);

Populates the arrays @keys with the all the keys that would pass
an C<exists> tests, and populates @hidden with the remaining legal
keys that have not been utilized.

Returns a reference to the hash.

In the case of an unrestricted hash this will be equivalent to

  $ref = do {
      @keys = keys %hash;
      @hidden = ();
      \%hash
  };

B<NOTE> this is an experimental feature that is heavily dependent
on the current implementation of restricted hashes. Should the
implementation change this routine may become meaningless in which
case it will behave identically to how it would behave on an
unrestricted hash.

=item B<hash_seed>

    my $hash_seed = hash_seed();

hash_seed() returns the seed number used to randomise hash ordering.
Zero means the "traditional" random hash ordering, non-zero means the
new even more random hash ordering introduced in Perl 5.8.1.

B<Note that the hash seed is sensitive information>: by knowing it one
can craft a denial-of-service attack against Perl code, even remotely,
see L<perlsec/"Algorithmic Complexity Attacks"> for more information.
B<Do not disclose the hash seed> to people who don't need to know it.
See also L<perlrun/PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG>.

=cut

sub hash_seed () {
    Internals::rehash_seed();
}

=item B<hv_store>

  my $sv = 0;
  hv_store(%hash,$key,$sv) or die "Failed to alias!";
  $hash{$key} = 1;
  print $sv; # prints 1

Stores an alias to a variable in a hash instead of copying the value.

=head2 Operating on references to hashes.

Most subroutines documented in this module have equivalent versions
that operate on references to hashes instead of native hashes.
The following is a list of these subs. They are identical except
in name and in that instead of taking a %hash they take a $hashref,
and additionally are not prototyped.

=head1 CAVEATS

Note that the trapping of the restricted operations is not atomic:
for example

    eval { %hash = (illegal_key => 1) }

leaves the C<%hash> empty rather than with its original contents.

=head1 BUGS

The interface exposed by this module is very close to the current
implementation of restricted hashes. Over time it is expected that
this behavior will be extended and the interface abstracted further.
