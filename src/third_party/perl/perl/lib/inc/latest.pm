=head1 NAME

inc::latest - use modules bundled in inc/ if they are newer than installed ones

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # in Build.PL
  use inc::latest 'Module::Build';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<inc::latest> module helps bootstrap configure-time dependencies for CPAN
distributions.  These dependencies get bundled into the C<inc> directory within
a distribution and are used by Build.PL (or Makefile.PL).

Arguments to C<inc::latest> are module names that are checked against both the
current C<@INC> array and against specially-named directories in C<inc>.  If
the bundled verison is newer than the installed one (or the module isn't
installed, then, the bundled directory is added to the start of <@INC> and the
module is loaded from there.

There are actually two variations of C<inc::latest> -- one for authors and one
for the C<inc> directory.  For distribution authors, the C<inc::latest>
installed in the system will record modules loaded via C<inc::latest> and can
be used to create the bundled files in C<inc>, including writing the second
variation as C<inc/latest.pm>.

This second C<inc::latest> is the one that is loaded in a distribution being
installed (e.g. from Build.PL).  This bundled C<inc::latest> is the one
that determines which module to load.

=head2 Special notes on bundling

The C<inc::latest> module creates bundled directories based on the packlist
file of an installed distribution.  Even though C<inc::latest> takes module
name arguments, it is better to think of it as bundling and making available
entire I<distributions>.  When a module is loaded through C<inc::latest>,
it looks in all bundled distributions in C<inc/> for a newer module than
can be found in the existing C<@INC> array.

Thus, the module-name provided should usually be the "top-level" module name of
a distribution, though this is not strictly required.  For example,
L<Module::Build> has a number of heuristics to map module names to packlists,
allowing users to do things like this:

  use inc::latest 'Devel::AssertOS::Unix';

even though Devel::AssertOS::Unix is contained within the Devel-CheckOS
distribution.

At the current time, packlists are required.  Thus, bundling dual-core modules
may require a 'forced install' over versions in the latest version of perl
in order to create the necessary packlist for bundling.

=head1 USAGE

When calling C<use>, the bundled C<inc::latest> takes a single module name and
optional arguments to pass to that module's own import method.

  use 'inc::latest' 'Foo::Bar' qw/foo bar baz/;

=head2 Author-mode

You are in author-mode inc::latest if any of the Author-mode methods are
available.  For example:

  if ( inc::latest->can('write') ) {
    inc::latest->write('inc');
  }

=over 4

=item loaded_modules()

  my @list = inc::latest->loaded_modules;

This takes no arguments and always returns a list of module names requested for
loading via "use inc::latest 'MODULE'", regardless of wether the load was
successful or not.

=item write()

  inc::latest->write( 'inc' );

This writes the bundled version of inc::latest to the directory name given as an
argument.  It almost all cases, it should be 'C<inc>'.

=item bundle_module()

  for my $mod ( inc::latest->loaded_modules ) {
    inc::latest->bundle_module($mod, $dir);
  }

If $mod corresponds to a packlist, then this function creates a specially-named
directory in $dir and copies all .pm files from the modlist to the new
directory (which almost always should just be 'inc').  For example, if Foo::Bar
is the name of the module, and $dir is 'inc', then the directory would be
'inc/inc_Foo-Bar' and contain files like this:

  inc/inc_Foo-Bar/Foo/Bar.pm

Currently, $mod B<must> have a packlist.  If this is not the case (e.g. for a
dual-core module), then the bundling will fail.  You may be able to create a
packlist by forced installing the module on top of the version that came with
core Perl.
