=head1 GETTING HELP

The F<perldoc> program gives you access to all the documentation that comes
with Perl.  You can get more documentation, tutorials and community support
online at L<http://www.perl.org/>.

If you're new to Perl, you should start by running C<perldoc perlintro>,
which is a general intro for beginners and provides some background to help
you navigate the rest of Perl's extensive documentation.  Run C<perldoc
perldoc> to learn more things you can do with F<perldoc>.

For ease of access, the Perl manual has been split up into several sections.

On a Unix-like system, these documentation files will usually also be
available as manpages for use with the F<man> program.

In general, if something strange has gone wrong with your program and you're
not sure where you should look for help, try the B<-w> switch first.  It will
often point out exactly where the trouble is.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl officially stands for Practical Extraction and Report Language,
except when it doesn't.

Perl was originally a language optimized for scanning arbitrary
text files, extracting information from those text files, and printing
reports based on that information.  It quickly became a good language
for many system management tasks. Over the years, Perl has grown into
a general-purpose programming language. It's widely used for everything
from quick "one-liners" to full-scale application development.

The language is intended to be practical (easy to use, efficient,
complete) rather than beautiful (tiny, elegant, minimal).

Perl combines (in the author's opinion, anyway) some of the best
features of C, B<sed>, B<awk>, and B<sh>, so people familiar with
those languages should have little difficulty with it.  (Language
historians will also note some vestiges of B<csh>, Pascal, and even
BASIC-PLUS.)  Expression syntax corresponds closely to C
expression syntax.  Unlike most Unix utilities, Perl does not
arbitrarily limit the size of your data--if you've got the memory,
Perl can slurp in your whole file as a single string.  Recursion is of
unlimited depth.  And the tables used by hashes (sometimes called
"associative arrays") grow as necessary to prevent degraded
performance.  Perl can use sophisticated pattern matching techniques to
scan large amounts of data quickly.  Although optimized for
scanning text, Perl also has many excellent tools for slicing
and dicing binary data.

But wait, there's more...

Begun in 1993 (see L<perlhist>), Perl version 5 is nearly a complete
rewrite that provides the following additional benefits:

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

The C<use warnings> pragma (and the B<-w> switch) produces some 
lovely diagnostics.

See L<perldiag> for explanations of all Perl's diagnostics.  The C<use
diagnostics> pragma automatically turns Perl's normally terse warnings
and errors into these longer forms.

Compilation errors will tell you the line number of the error, with an
indication of the next token or token type that was to be examined.
(In a script passed to Perl via B<-e> switches, each
B<-e> is counted as one line.)

Setuid scripts have additional constraints that can produce error
messages such as "Insecure dependency".  See L<perlsec>.

Did we mention that you should definitely consider using the B<-w>
switch?

=head1 BUGS

The B<-w> switch is not mandatory.

Perl is at the mercy of your machine's definitions of various
operations such as type casting, atof(), and floating-point
output with sprintf().

If your stdio requires a seek or eof between reads and writes on a
particular stream, so does Perl.  (This doesn't apply to sysread()
and syswrite().)

While none of the built-in data types have any arbitrary size limits
(apart from memory size), there are still a few arbitrary limits:  a
given variable name may not be longer than 251 characters.  Line numbers
displayed by diagnostics are internally stored as short integers,
so they are limited to a maximum of 65535 (higher numbers usually being
affected by wraparound).

You may mail your bug reports (be sure to include full configuration
information as output by the myconfig program in the perl source
tree, or by C<perl -V>) to perlbug@perl.org .  If you've succeeded
in compiling perl, the L<perlbug> script in the F<utils/> subdirectory
can be used to help mail in a bug report.

Perl actually stands for Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister, but
don't tell anyone I said that.

=head1 NOTES

The Perl motto is "There's more than one way to do it."  Divining
how many more is left as an exercise to the reader.

The three principal virtues of a programmer are Laziness,
Impatience, and Hubris.  See the Camel Book for why.
