perlapi - autogenerated documentation for the perl public API

=head1 DESCRIPTION
X<Perl API> X<API> X<api>

This file contains the documentation of the perl public API generated by
F<embed.pl>, specifically a listing of functions, macros, flags, and variables
that may be used by extension writers.  L<At the end|/Undocumented functions>
is a list of functions which have yet to be documented.  The interfaces of
those are subject to change without notice.  Any functions not listed here are
not part of the public API, and should not be used by extension writers at
all.  For these reasons, blindly using functions listed in proto.h is to be
avoided when writing extensions.

Note that all Perl API global variables must be referenced with the C<PL_>
prefix.  Some macros are provided for compatibility with the older,
unadorned names, but this support may be disabled in a future release.

Perl was originally written to handle US-ASCII only (that is characters
whose ordinal numbers are in the range 0 - 127).
And documentation and comments may still use the term ASCII, when
sometimes in fact the entire range from 0 - 255 is meant.

Note that Perl can be compiled and run under EBCDIC (See L<perlebcdic>)
or ASCII.  Most of the documentation (and even comments in the code)
ignore the EBCDIC possibility.  
For almost all purposes the differences are transparent.
As an example, under EBCDIC,
instead of UTF-8, UTF-EBCDIC is used to encode Unicode strings, and so
whenever this documentation refers to C<utf8>
(and variants of that name, including in function names),
it also (essentially transparently) means C<UTF-EBCDIC>.
But the ordinals of characters differ between ASCII, EBCDIC, and
the UTF- encodings, and a string encoded in UTF-EBCDIC may occupy more bytes
than in UTF-8.

Also, on some EBCDIC machines, functions that are documented as operating on
US-ASCII (or Basic Latin in Unicode terminology) may in fact operate on all
256 characters in the EBCDIC range, not just the subset corresponding to
US-ASCII.

The listing below is alphabetical, case insensitive.

=head1 Array Manipulation Functions

=over 8

=item AvFILL
X<AvFILL>

Same as C<av_len()>.  Deprecated, use C<av_len()> instead.

	int	AvFILL(AV* av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.h

=item av_clear
X<av_clear>

Clears an array, making it empty.  Does not free the memory the av uses to
store its list of scalars.  If any destructors are triggered as a result,
the av itself may be freed when this function returns.

Perl equivalent: C<@myarray = ();>.

	void	av_clear(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_create_and_push
X<av_create_and_push>

Push an SV onto the end of the array, creating the array if necessary.
A small internal helper function to remove a commonly duplicated idiom.

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.

	void	av_create_and_push(AV **const avp,
		                   SV *const val)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_create_and_unshift_one
X<av_create_and_unshift_one>

Unshifts an SV onto the beginning of the array, creating the array if
necessary.
A small internal helper function to remove a commonly duplicated idiom.

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.

	SV**	av_create_and_unshift_one(AV **const avp,
		                          SV *const val)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_delete
X<av_delete>

Deletes the element indexed by C<key> from the array, makes the element mortal,
and returns it.  If C<flags> equals C<G_DISCARD>, the element is freed and null
is returned.  Perl equivalent: C<my $elem = delete($myarray[$idx]);> for the
non-C<G_DISCARD> version and a void-context C<delete($myarray[$idx]);> for the
C<G_DISCARD> version.

	SV*	av_delete(AV *av, I32 key, I32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_exists
X<av_exists>

Returns true if the element indexed by C<key> has been initialized.

This relies on the fact that uninitialized array elements are set to
C<&PL_sv_undef>.

Perl equivalent: C<exists($myarray[$key])>.

	bool	av_exists(AV *av, I32 key)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_extend
X<av_extend>

Pre-extend an array.  The C<key> is the index to which the array should be
extended.

	void	av_extend(AV *av, I32 key)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_fetch
X<av_fetch>

Returns the SV at the specified index in the array.  The C<key> is the
index.  If lval is true, you are guaranteed to get a real SV back (in case
it wasn't real before), which you can then modify.  Check that the return
value is non-null before dereferencing it to a C<SV*>.

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for
more information on how to use this function on tied arrays. 

The rough perl equivalent is C<$myarray[$idx]>.

	SV**	av_fetch(AV *av, I32 key, I32 lval)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_fill
X<av_fill>

Set the highest index in the array to the given number, equivalent to
Perl's C<$#array = $fill;>.

The number of elements in the an array will be C<fill + 1> after
av_fill() returns.  If the array was previously shorter, then the
additional elements appended are set to C<PL_sv_undef>.  If the array
was longer, then the excess elements are freed.  C<av_fill(av, -1)> is
the same as C<av_clear(av)>.

	void	av_fill(AV *av, I32 fill)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_len
X<av_len>

Returns the highest index in the array.  The number of elements in the
array is C<av_len(av) + 1>.  Returns -1 if the array is empty.

The Perl equivalent for this is C<$#myarray>.

	I32	av_len(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_make
X<av_make>

Creates a new AV and populates it with a list of SVs.  The SVs are copied
into the array, so they may be freed after the call to av_make.  The new AV
will have a reference count of 1.

Perl equivalent: C<my @new_array = ($scalar1, $scalar2, $scalar3...);>

	AV*	av_make(I32 size, SV **strp)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_pop
X<av_pop>

Pops an SV off the end of the array.  Returns C<&PL_sv_undef> if the array
is empty.

Perl equivalent: C<pop(@myarray);>

	SV*	av_pop(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_push
X<av_push>

Pushes an SV onto the end of the array.  The array will grow automatically
to accommodate the addition.  This takes ownership of one reference count.

Perl equivalent: C<push @myarray, $elem;>.

	void	av_push(AV *av, SV *val)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_shift
X<av_shift>

Shifts an SV off the beginning of the
array.  Returns C<&PL_sv_undef> if the 
array is empty.

Perl equivalent: C<shift(@myarray);>

	SV*	av_shift(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_store
X<av_store>

Stores an SV in an array.  The array index is specified as C<key>.  The
return value will be NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not
need to be actually stored within the array (as in the case of tied
arrays). Otherwise, it can be dereferenced
to get the C<SV*> that was stored
there (= C<val>)).

Note that the caller is responsible for suitably incrementing the reference
count of C<val> before the call, and decrementing it if the function
returned NULL.

Approximate Perl equivalent: C<$myarray[$key] = $val;>.

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for
more information on how to use this function on tied arrays.

	SV**	av_store(AV *av, I32 key, SV *val)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_undef
X<av_undef>

Undefines the array.  Frees the memory used by the av to store its list of
scalars.  If any destructors are triggered as a result, the av itself may
be freed.

	void	av_undef(AV *av)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item av_unshift
X<av_unshift>

Unshift the given number of C<undef> values onto the beginning of the
array.  The array will grow automatically to accommodate the addition.  You
must then use C<av_store> to assign values to these new elements.

Perl equivalent: C<unshift @myarray, ( (undef) x $n );>
    
	void	av_unshift(AV *av, I32 num)

=for hackers
Found in file av.c

=item get_av
X<get_av>

Returns the AV of the specified Perl global or package array with the given
name (so it won't work on lexical variables).  C<flags> are passed 
to C<gv_fetchpv>. If C<GV_ADD> is set and the
Perl variable does not exist then it will be created.  If C<flags> is zero
and the variable does not exist then NULL is returned.

Perl equivalent: C<@{"$name"}>.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	AV*	get_av(const char *name, I32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file perl.c

=item sortsv
X<sortsv>

Sort an array. Here is an example:

    sortsv(AvARRAY(av), av_len(av)+1, Perl_sv_cmp_locale);

Currently this always uses mergesort. See sortsv_flags for a more
flexible routine.

=head1 Character case changing

=over 8

=item toLOWER
X<toLOWER>

=head1 Character classes

There are three variants for all the functions in this section.  The base ones
operate using the character set of the platform Perl is running on.  The ones
with an C<_A> suffix operate on the ASCII character set, and the ones with an
C<_L1> suffix operate on the full Latin1 character set.  All are unaffected by
locale and by C<use bytes>.

For ASCII platforms, the base function with no suffix and the one with the
C<_A> suffix are identical.  The function with the C<_L1> suffix imposes the
Latin-1 character set onto the platform.  That is, the code points that are
ASCII are unaffected, since ASCII is a subset of Latin-1.  But the non-ASCII
code points are treated as if they are Latin-1 characters.  For example,
C<isSPACE_L1()> will return true when called with the code point 0xA0, which is
the Latin-1 NO-BREAK SPACE.

For EBCDIC platforms, the base function with no suffix and the one with the
C<_L1> suffix should be identical, since, as of this writing, the EBCDIC code
pages that Perl knows about all are equivalent to Latin-1.  The function that
ends in an C<_A> suffix will not return true unless the specified character also
has an ASCII equivalent.

=head1 Cloning an interpreter

=over 8

=item perl_clone
X<perl_clone>

Create and return a new interpreter by cloning the current one.

perl_clone takes these flags as parameters:

CLONEf_COPY_STACKS - is used to, well, copy the stacks also,
without it we only clone the data and zero the stacks,
with it we copy the stacks and the new perl interpreter is
ready to run at the exact same point as the previous one.
The pseudo-fork code uses COPY_STACKS while the
threads->create doesn't.

CLONEf_KEEP_PTR_TABLE -
perl_clone keeps a ptr_table with the pointer of the old
variable as a key and the new variable as a value,
this allows it to check if something has been cloned and not
clone it again but rather just use the value and increase the
refcount.  If KEEP_PTR_TABLE is not set then perl_clone will kill
the ptr_table using the function
C<ptr_table_free(PL_ptr_table); PL_ptr_table = NULL;>,
reason to keep it around is if you want to dup some of your own
variable who are outside the graph perl scans, example of this
code is in threads.xs create.

CLONEf_CLONE_HOST -
This is a win32 thing, it is ignored on unix, it tells perls
win32host code (which is c++) to clone itself, this is needed on
win32 if you want to run two threads at the same time,
if you just want to do some stuff in a separate perl interpreter
and then throw it away and return to the original one,
you don't need to do anything.

Similar to

  pv_escape(dsv,pv,cur,pvlim,PERL_PV_ESCAPE_QUOTE);

except that an additional "\0" will be appended to the string when
len > cur and pv[cur] is "\0".

=item pv_escape
X<pv_escape>

Escapes at most the first "count" chars of pv and puts the results into
dsv such that the size of the escaped string will not exceed "max" chars
and will not contain any incomplete escape sequences.

If flags contains PERL_PV_ESCAPE_QUOTE then any double quotes in the string
will also be escaped.

Normally the SV will be cleared before the escaped string is prepared,
but when PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NOCLEAR is set this will not occur.

If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_UNI is set then the input string is treated as Unicode,
if PERL_PV_ESCAPE_UNI_DETECT is set then the input string is scanned
using C<is_utf8_string()> to determine if it is Unicode.

If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_ALL is set then all input chars will be output
using C<\x01F1> style escapes, otherwise if PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NONASCII is set, only
chars above 127 will be escaped using this style; otherwise, only chars above
255 will be so escaped; other non printable chars will use octal or
common escaped patterns like C<\n>. Otherwise, if PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NOBACKSLASH
then all chars below 255 will be treated as printable and
will be output as literals.

If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_FIRSTCHAR is set then only the first char of the
string will be escaped, regardless of max. If the output is to be in hex,
then it will be returned as a plain hex
sequence. Thus the output will either be a single char,
an octal escape sequence, a special escape like C<\n> or a hex value.

If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_RE is set then the escape char used will be a '%' and
not a '\\'. This is because regexes very often contain backslashed
sequences, whereas '%' is not a particularly common character in patterns.

Returns a pointer to the escaped text as held by dsv.

Converts a string into something presentable, handling escaping via

double quoted with any double quotes in the string escaped. Otherwise
if the PERL_PV_PRETTY_LTGT flag is set then the result be wrapped in
angle brackets. 

If the PERL_PV_PRETTY_ELLIPSES flag is set and not all characters in
string were output then an ellipsis C<...> will be appended to the
string. Note that this happens AFTER it has been quoted.

If start_color is non-null then it will be inserted after the opening
quote (if there is one) but before the escaped text. If end_color
is non-null then it will be inserted after the escaped text but before
any quotes or ellipses.

Returns a pointer to the prettified text as held by dsv.

=item PL_check
X<PL_check>

Array, indexed by opcode, of functions that will be called for the "check"
phase of optree building during compilation of Perl code.  For most (but
not all) types of op, once the op has been initially built and populated
with child ops it will be filtered through the check function referenced
by the appropriate element of this array.  The new op is passed in as the
sole argument to the check function, and the check function returns the
completed op.  The check function may (as the name suggests) check the op
for validity and signal errors.  It may also initialise or modify parts of
the ops, or perform more radical surgery such as adding or removing child
ops, or even throw the op away and return a different op in its place.

This array of function pointers is a convenient place to hook into the
compilation process.  An XS module can put its own custom check function
in place of any of the standard ones, to influence the compilation of a
particular type of op.  However, a custom check function must never fully
replace a standard check function (or even a custom check function from
another module).  A module modifying checking must instead B<wrap> the
preexisting check function.  A custom check function must be selective
about when to apply its custom behaviour.  In the usual case where
it decides not to do anything special with an op, it must chain the
preexisting op function.  Check functions are thus linked in a chain,
with the core's base checker at the end.

For thread safety, modules should not write directly to this array.
Instead, use the function L</wrap_op_checker>.

=for hackers
Found in file perlvars.h

=item PL_keyword_plugin
X<PL_keyword_plugin>

Function pointer, pointing at a function used to handle extended keywords.
The function should be declared as

	int keyword_plugin_function(pTHX_
		char *keyword_ptr, STRLEN keyword_len,
		OP **op_ptr)

The function is called from the tokeniser, whenever a possible keyword
is seen.  C<keyword_ptr> points at the word in the parser's input
buffer, and C<keyword_len> gives its length; it is not null-terminated.
The function is expected to examine the word, and possibly other state
such as L<%^H|perlvar/%^H>, to decide whether it wants to handle it
as an extended keyword.  If it does not, the function should return
C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_DECLINE>, and the normal parser process will continue.

If the function wants to handle the keyword, it first must
parse anything following the keyword that is part of the syntax
introduced by the keyword.  See L</Lexer interface> for details.

When a keyword is being handled, the plugin function must build
a tree of C<OP> structures, representing the code that was parsed.
The root of the tree must be stored in C<*op_ptr>.  The function then
returns a constant indicating the syntactic role of the construct that
it has parsed: C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_STMT> if it is a complete statement, or
C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_EXPR> if it is an expression.  Note that a statement
construct cannot be used inside an expression (except via C<do BLOCK>
and similar), and an expression is not a complete statement (it requires
at least a terminating semicolon).

When a keyword is handled, the plugin function may also have
(compile-time) side effects.  It may modify C<%^H>, define functions, and
so on.  Typically, if side effects are the main purpose of a handler,
it does not wish to generate any ops to be included in the normal
compilation.  In this case it is still required to supply an op tree,
but it suffices to generate a single null op.

That's how the C<*PL_keyword_plugin> function needs to behave overall.
Conventionally, however, one does not completely replace the existing
handler function.  Instead, take a copy of C<PL_keyword_plugin> before
assigning your own function pointer to it.  Your handler function should
look for keywords that it is interested in and handle those.  Where it
is not interested, it should call the saved plugin function, passing on
the arguments it received.  Thus C<PL_keyword_plugin> actually points
at a chain of handler functions, all of which have an opportunity to
handle keywords, and only the last function in the chain (built into
the Perl core) will normally return C<KEYWORD_PLUGIN_DECLINE>.

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.

AUTOLOAD lookup is performed if the given method is not present: non-zero
means yes, look for AUTOLOAD; zero means no, don't look for AUTOLOAD.
Calling C<gv_fetchmethod> is equivalent to calling C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>
with a non-zero C<autoload> parameter.

These functions grant C<"SUPER"> token as a prefix of the method name. Note
that if you want to keep the returned glob for a long time, you need to
check for it being "AUTOLOAD", since at the later time the call may load a
different subroutine due to $AUTOLOAD changing its value. Use the glob
created via a side effect to do this.

These functions have the same side-effects and as C<gv_fetchmeth> with
C<level==0>.  C<name> should be writable if contains C<':'> or C<'
''>. The warning against passing the GV returned by C<gv_fetchmeth> to
C<call_sv> apply equally to these functions.

Returns the glob with the given C<name> and a defined subroutine or
C<NULL>.  The glob lives in the given C<stash>, or in the stashes
accessible via @ISA and UNIVERSAL::.

The argument C<level> should be either 0 or -1.  If C<level==0>, as a
side-effect creates a glob with the given C<name> in the given C<stash>
which in the case of success contains an alias for the subroutine, and sets
up caching info for this glob.

Currently, the only significant value for C<flags> is SVf_UTF8.

This function grants C<"SUPER"> token as a postfix of the stash name. The
GV returned from C<gv_fetchmeth> may be a method cache entry, which is not
visible to Perl code.  So when calling C<call_sv>, you should not use
the GV directly; instead, you should use the method's CV, which can be
obtained from the GV with the C<GvCV> macro.

X<gv_init_pvn>

Converts a scalar into a typeglob.  This is an incoercible typeglob;
assigning a reference to it will assign to one of its slots, instead of
overwriting it as happens with typeglobs created by SvSetSV.  Converting
any scalar that is SvOK() may produce unpredictable results and is reserved
for perl's internal use.

C<gv> is the scalar to be converted.

C<stash> is the parent stash/package, if any.

C<name> and C<len> give the name.  The name must be unqualified;
that is, it must not include the package name.  If C<gv> is a
stash element, it is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the name
passed to this function matches the name of the element.  If it does not
match, perl's internal bookkeeping will get out of sync.

C<flags> can be set to SVf_UTF8 if C<name> is a UTF8 string, or
the return value of SvUTF8(sv).  It can also take the
GV_ADDMULTI flag, which means to pretend that the GV has been
seen before (i.e., suppress "Used once" warnings).

necessary dereferencing of possibly C<SV*> keys.  The length of the string
is placed in C<len> (this is a macro, so do I<not> use C<&len>).  If you do
not care about what the length of the key is, you may use the global
variable C<PL_na>, though this is rather less efficient than using a local
variable.  Remember though, that hash keys in perl are free to contain
embedded nulls, so using C<strlen()> or similar is not a good way to find
the length of hash keys. This is very similar to the C<SvPV()> macro
described elsewhere in this document. See also C<HeUTF8>.

If you are using C<HePV> to get values to pass to C<newSVpvn()> to create a

Returns entries from a hash iterator.  See C<hv_iterinit> and C<hv_iternext>.
The C<flags> value will normally be zero; if HV_ITERNEXT_WANTPLACEHOLDERS is
set the placeholders keys (for restricted hashes) will be returned in addition
to normal keys. By default placeholders are automatically skipped over.
Currently a placeholder is implemented with a value that is
C<&PL_sv_placeholder>.  Note that the implementation of placeholders and
restricted hashes may change, and the implementation currently is
insufficiently abstracted for any change to be tidy.

=item hv_store
X<hv_store>

Stores an SV in a hash.  The hash key is specified as C<key> and the
absolute value of C<klen> is the length of the key.  If C<klen> is
negative the key is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  The
C<hash> parameter is the precomputed hash value; if it is zero then
Perl will compute it.

The return value will be
NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise it can
be dereferenced to get the original C<SV*>.  Note that the caller is
responsible for suitably incrementing the reference count of C<val> before
the call, and decrementing it if the function returned NULL.  Effectively
a successful hv_store takes ownership of one reference to C<val>.  This is
usually what you want; a newly created SV has a reference count of one, so
if all your code does is create SVs then store them in a hash, hv_store
will own the only reference to the new SV, and your code doesn't need to do
anything further to tidy up.  hv_store is not implemented as a call to
hv_store_ent, and does not create a temporary SV for the key, so if your
key data is not already in SV form then use hv_store in preference to
hv_store_ent.

Stores C<val> in a hash.  The hash key is specified as C<key>.  The C<hash>
parameter is the precomputed hash value; if it is zero then Perl will
compute it.  The return value is the new hash entry so created.  It will be
NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise the
contents of the return value can be accessed using the C<He?> macros
described here.  Note that the caller is responsible for suitably
incrementing the reference count of C<val> before the call, and
decrementing it if the function returned NULL.  Effectively a successful
hv_store_ent takes ownership of one reference to C<val>.  This is
usually what you want; a newly created SV has a reference count of one, so
if all your code does is create SVs then store them in a hash, hv_store
will own the only reference to the new SV, and your code doesn't need to do
anything further to tidy up.  Note that hv_store_ent only reads the C<key>;
unlike C<val> it does not take ownership of it, so maintaining the correct
reference count on C<key> is entirely the caller's responsibility.  hv_store
is not implemented as a call to hv_store_ent, and does not create a temporary
SV for the key, so if your key data is not already in SV form then use
hv_store in preference to hv_store_ent.

=head1 Hook manipulation

=over 8

=item wrap_op_checker
X<wrap_op_checker>

Puts a C function into the chain of check functions for a specified op
type.  This is the preferred way to manipulate the L</PL_check> array.
I<opcode> specifies which type of op is to be affected.  I<new_checker>
is a pointer to the C function that is to be added to that opcode's
check chain, and I<old_checker_p> points to the storage location where a
pointer to the next function in the chain will be stored.  The value of
I<new_pointer> is written into the L</PL_check> array, while the value
previously stored there is written to I<*old_checker_p>.

L</PL_check> is global to an entire process, and a module wishing to
hook op checking may find itself invoked more than once per process,
typically in different threads.  To handle that situation, this function
is idempotent.  The location I<*old_checker_p> must initially (once
per process) contain a null pointer.  A C variable of static duration
(declared at file scope, typically also marked C<static> to give
it internal linkage) will be implicitly initialised appropriately,
if it does not have an explicit initialiser.  This function will only
actually modify the check chain if it finds I<*old_checker_p> to be null.
This function is also thread safe on the small scale.  It uses appropriate
locking to avoid race conditions in accessing L</PL_check>.

When this function is called, the function referenced by I<new_checker>
must be ready to be called, except for I<*old_checker_p> being unfilled.
In a threading situation, I<new_checker> may be called immediately,
even before this function has returned.  I<*old_checker_p> will always
be appropriately set before I<new_checker> is called.  If I<new_checker>
decides not to do anything special with an op that it is given (which
is the usual case for most uses of op check hooking), it must chain the
check function referenced by I<*old_checker_p>.

If you want to influence compilation of calls to a specific subroutine,
then use L</cv_set_call_checker> rather than hooking checking of all
C<entersub> ops.

=head1 Lexer interface

=over 8

=item lex_bufutf8
X<lex_bufutf8>

Indicates whether the octets in the lexer buffer
(L</PL_parser-E<gt>linestr>) should be interpreted as the UTF-8 encoding
of Unicode characters.  If not, they should be interpreted as Latin-1
characters.  This is analogous to the C<SvUTF8> flag for scalars.

In UTF-8 mode, it is not guaranteed that the lexer buffer actually
contains valid UTF-8.  Lexing code must be robust in the face of invalid
encoding.

The actual C<SvUTF8> flag of the L</PL_parser-E<gt>linestr> scalar
is significant, but not the whole story regarding the input character
encoding.  Normally, when a file is being read, the scalar contains octets
and its C<SvUTF8> flag is off, but the octets should be interpreted as
UTF-8 if the C<use utf8> pragma is in effect.  During a string eval,
however, the scalar may have the C<SvUTF8> flag on, and in this case its
octets should be interpreted as UTF-8 unless the C<use bytes> pragma
is in effect.  This logic may change in the future; use this function
instead of implementing the logic yourself.

Discards the first part of the L</PL_parser-E<gt>linestr> buffer,

all pointers into the buffer updated appropriately.  I<ptr> must not
be later in the buffer than the position of L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufptr>:
it is not permitted to discard text that has yet to be lexed.

Normally it is not necessarily to do this directly, because it suffices to
use the implicit discarding behaviour of L</lex_next_chunk> and things
based on it.  However, if a token stretches across multiple lines,
and the lexing code has kept multiple lines of text in the buffer for
that purpose, then after completion of the token it would be wise to
explicitly discard the now-unneeded earlier lines, to avoid future
multi-line tokens growing the buffer without bound.

=item lex_next_chunk

Reads in the next chunk of text to be lexed, appending it to

looked to the end of the current chunk and wants to know more.  It is
usual, but not necessary, for lexing to have consumed the entirety of
the current chunk at this time.

If L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufptr> is pointing to the very end of the current
chunk (i.e., the current chunk has been entirely consumed), normally the
current chunk will be discarded at the same time that the new chunk is
read in.  If I<flags> includes C<LEX_KEEP_PREVIOUS>, the current chunk
will not be discarded.  If the current chunk has not been entirely
consumed, then it will not be discarded regardless of the flag.

Returns true if some new text was added to the buffer, or false if the

text, the next chunk will be read in.  Normally the current chunk will be
discarded at the same time, but if I<flags> includes C<LEX_KEEP_PREVIOUS>
then the current chunk will not be discarded.

If the input is being interpreted as UTF-8 and a UTF-8 encoding error

L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufptr> is moved past the spaces, so that it points
at a non-space character (or the end of the input text).

If spaces extend into the next chunk of input text, the next chunk will

Creates and initialises a new lexer/parser state object, supplying

A pointer to the new state object is placed in L</PL_parser>.  An entry
is made on the save stack so that upon unwinding the new state object
will be destroyed and the former value of L</PL_parser> will be restored.
Nothing else need be done to clean up the parsing context.

The code to be parsed comes from I<line> and I<rsfp>.  I<line>, if
non-null, provides a string (in SV form) containing code to be parsed.
A copy of the string is made, so subsequent modification of I<line>
does not affect parsing.  I<rsfp>, if non-null, provides an input stream
from which code will be read to be parsed.  If both are non-null, the
code in I<line> comes first and must consist of complete lines of input,
and I<rsfp> supplies the remainder of the source.

The I<flags> parameter is reserved for future use.  Currently it is only
used by perl internally, so extensions should always pass zero.

parser state (L</PL_parser> et al) is correctly set to reflect the source
of the code to be parsed and the lexical context for the statement.

The op tree representing the statement is returned.  This may be a
null pointer if the statement is null, for example if it was actually
a subroutine definition (which has compile-time side effects).  If not
null, it will be the result of a L</newSTATEOP> call, normally including
a C<nextstate> or equivalent op.

If an error occurs in parsing or compilation, in most cases a valid op

Some compilation errors, however, will throw an exception immediately.

The I<flags> parameter is reserved for future use, and must always
be zero.

Parse a single label, possibly optional, of the type that may prefix a

The name of the label is returned in the form of a fresh scalar.  If an
optional label is absent, a null pointer is returned.

If an error occurs in parsing, which can only occur if the label is

X<parse_listexpr>

Parse a Perl list expression.  This may contain operators of precedence
down to the comma operator.  The expression must be followed (and thus
terminated) either by a low-precedence logic operator such as C<or> or by
something that would normally terminate an expression such as semicolon.
If I<flags> includes C<PARSE_OPTIONAL> then the expression is optional,
otherwise it is mandatory.  It is up to the caller to ensure that the
dynamic parser state (L</PL_parser> et al) is correctly set to reflect
the source of the code to be parsed and the lexical context for the
expression.

The op tree representing the expression is returned.  If an optional
expression is absent, a null pointer is returned, otherwise the pointer
will be non-null.

If an error occurs in parsing or compilation, in most cases a valid op

=item parse_stmtseq
X<parse_stmtseq>

Parse a sequence of zero or more Perl statements.  These may be normal
imperative statements, including optional labels, or declarations
that have compile-time effect, or any mixture thereof.  The statement
sequence ends when a closing brace or end-of-file is encountered in a
place where a new statement could have validly started.  It is up to
the caller to ensure that the dynamic parser state (L</PL_parser> et al)
is correctly set to reflect the source of the code to be parsed and the
lexical context for the statements.

The op tree representing the statement sequence is returned.  This may
be a null pointer if the statements were all null, for example if there
were no statements or if there were only subroutine definitions (which
have compile-time side effects).  If not null, it will be a C<lineseq>
list, normally including C<nextstate> or equivalent ops.

If an error occurs in parsing or compilation, in most cases a valid op
tree is returned anyway.  The error is reflected in the parser state,
normally resulting in a single exception at the top level of parsing
which covers all the compilation errors that occurred.  Some compilation

something that would normally terminate an expression such as semicolon.
If I<flags> includes C<PARSE_OPTIONAL> then the expression is optional,
otherwise it is mandatory.  It is up to the caller to ensure that the

=item PL_parser-E<gt>bufend
X<PL_parser-E<gt>bufend>

Direct pointer to the end of the chunk of text currently being lexed, the
end of the lexer buffer.  This is equal to C<SvPVX(PL_parser-E<gt>linestr)
+ SvCUR(PL_parser-E<gt>linestr)>.  A NUL character (zero octet) is
always located at the end of the buffer, and does not count as part of
the buffer's contents.

removed without notice.

=for hackers
Found in file toke.c

=item PL_parser-E<gt>bufptr
X<PL_parser-E<gt>bufptr>

Points to the current position of lexing inside the lexer buffer.
Characters around this point may be freely examined, within
the range delimited by C<SvPVX(L</PL_parser-E<gt>linestr>)> and
L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufend>.  The octets of the buffer may be intended to be
interpreted as either UTF-8 or Latin-1, as indicated by L</lex_bufutf8>.

Lexing code (whether in the Perl core or not) moves this pointer past
the characters that it consumes.  It is also expected to perform some
bookkeeping whenever a newline character is consumed.  This movement
can be more conveniently performed by the function L</lex_read_to>,
which handles newlines appropriately.

Interpretation of the buffer's octets can be abstracted out by
using the slightly higher-level functions L</lex_peek_unichar> and
L</lex_read_unichar>.

Points to the start of the current line inside the lexer buffer.
This is useful for indicating at which column an error occurred, and
not much else.  This must be updated by any lexing code that consumes
a newline; the function L</lex_read_to> handles this detail.

=item PL_parser-E<gt>linestr
X<PL_parser-E<gt>linestr>

Buffer scalar containing the chunk currently under consideration of the
text currently being lexed.  This is always a plain string scalar (for
which C<SvPOK> is true).  It is not intended to be used as a scalar by
normal scalar means; instead refer to the buffer directly by the pointer
variables described below.

The lexer maintains various C<char*> pointers to things in the
C<PL_parser-E<gt>linestr> buffer.  If C<PL_parser-E<gt>linestr> is ever
reallocated, all of these pointers must be updated.  Don't attempt to
do this manually, but rather use L</lex_grow_linestr> if you need to
reallocate the buffer.

The content of the text chunk in the buffer is commonly exactly one
complete line of input, up to and including a newline terminator,
but there are situations where it is otherwise.  The octets of the
buffer may be intended to be interpreted as either UTF-8 or Latin-1.
The function L</lex_bufutf8> tells you which.  Do not use the C<SvUTF8>
flag on this scalar, which may disagree with it.

For direct examination of the buffer, the variable
L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufend> points to the end of the buffer.  The current
lexing position is pointed to by L</PL_parser-E<gt>bufptr>.  Direct use
of these pointers is usually preferable to examination of the scalar
through normal scalar means.

removed without notice.

need to call this method afterwards:

1) Directly manipulating the stash HV entries from
XS code.

2) Assigning a reference to a readonly scalar

a constant subroutine (like constant.pm

Return a non-zero integer if the sign bit on an NV is set, and 0 if

If Configure detects this system has a signbit() that will work with
our NVs, then we just use it via the #define in perl.h.  Otherwise,
fall back on this implementation.  As a first pass, this gets everything
right except -0.0.  Alas, catching -0.0 is the main use for this function,
so this is not too helpful yet.  Still, at least we have the scaffolding
in place to support other systems, should that prove useful.


Configure notes:  This function is called 'Perl_signbit' instead of a
plain 'signbit' because it is easy to imagine a system having a signbit()
function or macro that doesn't happen to work with our particular choice
of NVs.  We shouldn't just re-#define signbit as Perl_signbit and expect
the standard system headers to be happy.  Also, this is a no-context
function (no pTHX_) because Perl_signbit() is usually re-#defined in
perl.h as a simple macro call to the system's signbit().
Users should just always call Perl_signbit().

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.

Performs the fixup of the arguments part of an C<entersub> op tree
based on a subroutine prototype.  This makes various modifications to
the argument ops, from applying context up to inserting C<refgen> ops,
and checking the number and syntactic types of arguments, as directed by
the prototype.  This is the standard treatment used on a subroutine call,
not marked with C<&>, where the callee can be identified at compile time
and has a prototype.

I<protosv> supplies the subroutine prototype to be applied to the call.
It may be a normal defined scalar, of which the string value will be used.
Alternatively, for convenience, it may be a subroutine object (a C<CV*>
that has been cast to C<SV*>) which has a prototype.  The prototype
supplied, in whichever form, does not need to match the actual callee
referenced by the op tree.

If the argument ops disagree with the prototype, for example by having
an unacceptable number of arguments, a valid op tree is returned anyway.
The error is reflected in the parser state, normally resulting in a single
exception at the top level of parsing which covers all the compilation

=item rv2cv_op_cv
X<rv2cv_op_cv>

Examines an op, which is expected to identify a subroutine at runtime,
and attempts to determine at compile time which subroutine it identifies.
This is normally used during Perl compilation to determine whether
a prototype can be applied to a function call.  I<cvop> is the op
being considered, normally an C<rv2cv> op.  A pointer to the identified
subroutine is returned, if it could be determined statically, and a null
pointer is returned if it was not possible to determine statically.

Currently, the subroutine can be identified statically if the RV that the
C<rv2cv> is to operate on is provided by a suitable C<gv> or C<const> op.
A C<gv> op is suitable if the GV's CV slot is populated.  A C<const> op is
suitable if the constant value must be an RV pointing to a CV.  Details of
this process may change in future versions of Perl.  If the C<rv2cv> op
has the C<OPpENTERSUB_AMPER> flag set then no attempt is made to identify
the subroutine statically: this flag is used to suppress compile-time
magic on a subroutine call, forcing it to use default runtime behaviour.

If I<flags> has the bit C<RV2CVOPCV_MARK_EARLY> set, then the handling
of a GV reference is modified.  If a GV was examined and its CV slot was
found to be empty, then the C<gv> op has the C<OPpEARLY_CV> flag set.
If the op is not optimised away, and the CV slot is later populated with
a subroutine having a prototype, that flag eventually triggers the warning
"called too early to check prototype".

If I<flags> has the bit C<RV2CVOPCV_RETURN_NAME_GV> set, then instead
of returning a pointer to the subroutine it returns a pointer to the
GV giving the most appropriate name for the subroutine in this context.
Normally this is just the C<CvGV> of the subroutine, but for an anonymous
(C<CvANON>) subroutine that is referenced through a GV it will be the
referencing GV.  The resulting C<GV*> is cast to C<CV*> to be returned.
A null pointer is returned as usual if there is no statically-determinable
subroutine.

=item CvPADLIST
X<CvPADLIST>

CV's can have CvPADLIST(cv) set to point to an AV.  This is the CV's
scratchpad, which stores lexical variables and opcode temporary and
per-thread values.

For these purposes "forms" are a kind-of CV, eval""s are too (except they're
not callable at will and are always thrown away after the eval"" is done
executing). Require'd files are simply evals without any outer lexical
scope.

XSUBs don't have CvPADLIST set - dXSTARG fetches values from PL_curpad,
but that is really the callers pad (a slot of which is allocated by
every entersub).

The CvPADLIST AV has the REFCNT of its component items managed "manually"
(mostly in pad.c) rather than by normal av.c rules.  So we turn off AvREAL
just before freeing it, to let av.c know not to touch the entries.
The items in the AV are not SVs as for a normal AV, but other AVs:

0'th Entry of the CvPADLIST is an AV which represents the "names" or rather
the "static type information" for lexicals.

The CvDEPTH'th entry of CvPADLIST AV is an AV which is the stack frame at that
depth of recursion into the CV.
The 0'th slot of a frame AV is an AV which is @_.
other entries are storage for variables and op targets.

Iterating over the names AV iterates over all possible pad
items. Pad slots that are SVs_PADTMP (targets/GVs/constants) end up having
&PL_sv_undef "names" (see pad_alloc()).

Only my/our variable (SVs_PADMY/SVs_PADOUR) slots get valid names.
The rest are op targets/GVs/constants which are statically allocated
or resolved at compile time.  These don't have names by which they
can be looked up from Perl code at run time through eval"" like
my/our variables can be.  Since they can't be looked up by "name"
but only by their index allocated at compile time (which is usually
in PL_op->op_targ), wasting a name SV for them doesn't make sense.

The SVs in the names AV have their PV being the name of the variable.
xlow+1..xhigh inclusive in the NV union is a range of cop_seq numbers for
which the name is valid (accessed through the macros COP_SEQ_RANGE_LOW and
_HIGH).  During compilation, these fields may hold the special value
PERL_PADSEQ_INTRO to indicate various stages:

   COP_SEQ_RANGE_LOW        _HIGH
   -----------------        -----
   PERL_PADSEQ_INTRO            0   variable not yet introduced:   { my ($x
   valid-seq#   PERL_PADSEQ_INTRO   variable in scope:             { my ($x)
   valid-seq#          valid-seq#   compilation of scope complete: { my ($x) }

For typed lexicals name SV is SVt_PVMG and SvSTASH
points at the type.  For C<our> lexicals, the type is also SVt_PVMG, with the
SvOURSTASH slot pointing at the stash of the associated global (so that
duplicate C<our> declarations in the same package can be detected).  SvUVX is
sometimes hijacked to store the generation number during compilation.

If SvFAKE is set on the name SV, then that slot in the frame AV is
a REFCNT'ed reference to a lexical from "outside". In this case,
the name SV does not use xlow and xhigh to store a cop_seq range, since it is
in scope throughout. Instead xhigh stores some flags containing info about
the real lexical (is it declared in an anon, and is it capable of being
instantiated multiple times?), and for fake ANONs, xlow contains the index
within the parent's pad where the lexical's value is stored, to make
cloning quicker.

If the 'name' is '&' the corresponding entry in frame AV
is a CV representing a possible closure.
(SvFAKE and name of '&' is not a meaningful combination currently but could
become so if C<my sub foo {}> is implemented.)

Note that formats are treated as anon subs, and are cloned each time
write is called (if necessary).

The flag SVs_PADSTALE is cleared on lexicals each time the my() is executed,
and set on scope exit. This allows the 'Variable $x is not available' warning
to be generated in evals, such as 

    { my $x = 1; sub f { eval '$x'} } f();

For state vars, SVs_PADSTALE is overloaded to mean 'not yet initialised'

=item PL_modglobal
X<PL_modglobal>

C<PL_modglobal> is a general purpose, interpreter global HV for use by
extensions that need to keep information on a per-interpreter basis.
In a pinch, it can also be used as a symbol table for extensions
to share data among each other.  It is a good idea to use keys
prefixed by the package name of the extension that owns the data.

X<PL_na>

A convenience variable which is typically used with C<SvPV> when one
doesn't care about the length of the string.  It is usually more efficient
to either declare a local variable and use that instead or to use the
C<SvPV_nolen> macro.

=item PL_opfreehook
X<PL_opfreehook>

When non-C<NULL>, the function pointed by this variable will be called each time an OP is freed with the corresponding OP as the argument.
This allows extensions to free any extra attribute they have locally attached to an OP.
It is also assured to first fire for the parent OP and then for its kids.

When you replace this variable, it is considered a good practice to store the possibly previously installed hook and that you recall it inside your own.

X<PL_peepp>

Pointer to the per-subroutine peephole optimiser.  This is a function
that gets called at the end of compilation of a Perl subroutine (or
equivalently independent piece of Perl code) to perform fixups of
some ops and to perform small-scale optimisations.  The function is
called once for each subroutine that is compiled, and is passed, as sole
parameter, a pointer to the op that is the entry point to the subroutine.
It modifies the op tree in place.

The peephole optimiser should never be completely replaced.  Rather,
add code to it by wrapping the existing optimiser.  The basic way to do
this can be seen in L<perlguts/Compile pass 3: peephole optimization>.
If the new code wishes to operate on ops throughout the subroutine's
structure, rather than just at the top level, it is likely to be more
convenient to wrap the L</PL_rpeepp> hook.

once for each chain of ops linked through their C<op_next> fields;
it is recursively called to handle each side chain.  It is passed, as
sole parameter, a pointer to the op that is at the head of the chain.
It modifies the op tree in place.

A specialised variant of C<croak()> for emitting the usage message for xsubs

    croak_xs_usage(cv, "eee_yow");

works out the package name and subroutine name from C<cv>, and then calls
C<croak()>. Hence if C<cv> is C<&ouch::awk>, it would call C<croak> as:

X<SvGAMAGIC>

Returns true if the SV has get magic or
overloading.  If either is true then
the scalar is active data, and has the potential to return a new value every
time it is accessed.  Hence you must be careful to
only read it once per user logical operation and work
with that returned value.  If neither is true then
the scalar's value cannot change unless written to.

space is allocated.)  The reference count for the new SV is set to 1.

In 5.9.3, newSV() replaces the older NEWSV() API, and drops the first
parameter, I<x>, a debug aid which allowed callers to identify themselves.
This aid has been superseded by a new build option, PERL_MEM_LOG (see

Creates a new SV and copies a buffer into it, which may contain NUL characters
(C<\0>) and other binary data.  The reference count for the SV is set to 1.
Note that if C<len> is zero, Perl will create a zero length (Perl) string.  You
are responsible for ensuring that the source buffer is at least
C<len> bytes long.  If the C<buffer> argument is NULL the new SV will be
undefined.

Creates a new SV and copies a string into it.  The reference count for the

string.  You are responsible for ensuring that the source string is at least
C<len> bytes long.  If the C<s> argument is NULL the new SV will be undefined.
Currently the only flag bits accepted are C<SVf_UTF8> and C<SVs_TEMP>.
If C<SVs_TEMP> is set, then C<sv_2mortal()> is called on the result before
returning.  If C<SVf_UTF8> is set, C<s>
is considered to be in UTF-8 and the
C<SVf_UTF8> flag will be set on the new SV.
C<newSVpvn_utf8()> is a convenience wrapper for this function, defined as

Creates a new SV with its SvPVX_const pointing to a shared string in the string

created first.  Turns on READONLY and FAKE.  If the C<hash> parameter
is non-zero, that value is used; otherwise the hash is computed.
The string's hash can later be retrieved from the SV
with the C<SvSHARED_HASH()> macro.  The idea here is
that as the string table is used for shared hash keys these strings will have
SvPVX_const == HeKEY and hash lookup will avoid string compare.

we do the copy, and is also used locally.  If C<SV_COW_DROP_PV> is set

SvPOK_off rather than making a copy.  (Used where this
scalar is about to be set to some other value.)  In addition,

X<sv_usepvn_flags>

Tells an SV to use C<ptr> to find its string value.  Normally the
string is stored inside the SV but sv_usepvn allows the SV to use an
outside string.  The C<ptr> should point to memory that was allocated
by C<malloc>.  It must be the start of a mallocked block
of memory, and not a pointer to the middle of it.  The
string length, C<len>, must be supplied.  By default
this function will realloc (i.e. move) the memory pointed to by C<ptr>,
so that pointer should not be freed or used by the programmer after
giving it to sv_usepvn, and neither should any pointers from "behind"
that pointer (e.g. ptr + 1) be used.

If C<flags> & SV_SMAGIC is true, will call SvSETMAGIC.  If C<flags> &
SV_HAS_TRAILING_NUL is true, then C<ptr[len]> must be NUL, and the realloc
will be skipped (i.e. the buffer is actually at least 1 byte longer than
C<len>, and already meets the requirements for storing in C<SvPVX>).

=item bytes_from_utf8
X<bytes_from_utf8>

Converts a string C<s> of length C<len> from UTF-8 into native byte encoding.
Unlike L</utf8_to_bytes> but like L</bytes_to_utf8>, returns a pointer to
the newly-created string, and updates C<len> to contain the new
length.  Returns the original string if no conversion occurs, C<len>
is unchanged. Do nothing if C<is_utf8> points to 0. Sets C<is_utf8> to
0 if C<s> is converted or consisted entirely of characters that are invariant
in utf8 (i.e., US-ASCII on non-EBCDIC machines).

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.

=item foldEQ_utf8
X<foldEQ_utf8>

Returns true if the leading portions of the strings C<s1> and C<s2> (either or both
of which may be in UTF-8) are the same case-insensitively; false otherwise.
How far into the strings to compare is determined by other input parameters.

If C<u1> is true, the string C<s1> is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode;
otherwise it is assumed to be in native 8-bit encoding.  Correspondingly for C<u2>
with respect to C<s2>.

If the byte length C<l1> is non-zero, it says how far into C<s1> to check for fold
equality.  In other words, C<s1>+C<l1> will be used as a goal to reach.  The
scan will not be considered to be a match unless the goal is reached, and
scanning won't continue past that goal.  Correspondingly for C<l2> with respect to
C<s2>.

If C<pe1> is non-NULL and the pointer it points to is not NULL, that pointer is
considered an end pointer beyond which scanning of C<s1> will not continue under
any circumstances.  This means that if both C<l1> and C<pe1> are specified, and
C<pe1>
is less than C<s1>+C<l1>, the match will never be successful because it can
never
get as far as its goal (and in fact is asserted against).  Correspondingly for
C<pe2> with respect to C<s2>.

At least one of C<s1> and C<s2> must have a goal (at least one of C<l1> and
C<l2> must be non-zero), and if both do, both have to be
reached for a successful match.   Also, if the fold of a character is multiple
characters, all of them must be matched (see tr21 reference below for
'folding').

Upon a successful match, if C<pe1> is non-NULL,
it will be set to point to the beginning of the I<next> character of C<s1>
beyond what was matched.  Correspondingly for C<pe2> and C<s2>.

For case-insensitiveness, the "casefolding" of Unicode is used
instead of upper/lowercasing both the characters, see
L<http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr21/> (Case Mappings).

X<utf8n_to_uvuni>

Bottom level UTF-8 decode routine.
Returns the code point value of the first character in the string C<s>,
which is assumed to be in UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC) encoding, and no longer than
C<curlen> bytes; C<*retlen> (if C<retlen> isn't NULL) will be set to
the length, in bytes, of that character.

The value of C<flags> determines the behavior when C<s> does not point to a
well-formed UTF-8 character.  If C<flags> is 0, when a malformation is found,
zero is returned and C<*retlen> is set so that (S<C<s> + C<*retlen>>) is the
next possible position in C<s> that could begin a non-malformed character.
Also, if UTF-8 warnings haven't been lexically disabled, a warning is raised.

Various ALLOW flags can be set in C<flags> to allow (and not warn on)
individual types of malformations, such as the sequence being overlong (that
is, when there is a shorter sequence that can express the same code point;
overlong sequences are expressly forbidden in the UTF-8 standard due to
potential security issues).  Another malformation example is the first byte of
a character not being a legal first byte.  See F<utf8.h> for the list of such
flags.  For allowed 0 length strings, this function returns 0; for allowed
overlong sequences, the computed code point is returned; for all other allowed
malformations, the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER is returned, as these have no
determinable reasonable value.

The UTF8_CHECK_ONLY flag overrides the behavior when a non-allowed (by other
flags) malformation is found.  If this flag is set, the routine assumes that
the caller will raise a warning, and this function will silently just set
C<retlen> to C<-1> and return zero.

Certain code points are considered problematic.  These are Unicode surrogates,
Unicode non-characters, and code points above the Unicode maximum of 0x10FFFF.
By default these are considered regular code points, but certain situations
warrant special handling for them.  If C<flags> contains
UTF8_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE, all three classes are treated as
malformations and handled as such.  The flags UTF8_DISALLOW_SURROGATE,
UTF8_DISALLOW_NONCHAR, and UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER (meaning above the legal Unicode
maximum) can be set to disallow these categories individually.

The flags UTF8_WARN_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE, UTF8_WARN_SURROGATE,
UTF8_WARN_NONCHAR, and UTF8_WARN_SUPER will cause warning messages to be raised
for their respective categories, but otherwise the code points are considered
valid (not malformations).  To get a category to both be treated as a
malformation and raise a warning, specify both the WARN and DISALLOW flags.
(But note that warnings are not raised if lexically disabled nor if
UTF8_CHECK_ONLY is also specified.)

Very large code points (above 0x7FFF_FFFF) are considered more problematic than
the others that are above the Unicode legal maximum.  There are several
reasons: they requre at least 32 bits to represent them on ASCII platforms, are
not representable at all on EBCDIC platforms, and the original UTF-8
specification never went above this number (the current 0x10FFFF limit was
imposed later).  (The smaller ones, those that fit into 32 bits, are
representable by a UV on ASCII platforms, but not by an IV, which means that
the number of operations that can be performed on them is quite restricted.)
The UTF-8 encoding on ASCII platforms for these large code points begins with a
byte containing 0xFE or 0xFF.  The UTF8_DISALLOW_FE_FF flag will cause them to
be treated as malformations, while allowing smaller above-Unicode code points.
(Of course UTF8_DISALLOW_SUPER will treat all above-Unicode code points,
including these, as malformations.) Similarly, UTF8_WARN_FE_FF acts just like
the other WARN flags, but applies just to these code points.

All other code points corresponding to Unicode characters, including private
use and those yet to be assigned, are never considered malformed and never
warn.

Most code should use L</utf8_to_uvchr_buf>() rather than call this directly.

the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER, if not) is silently returned, and C<*retlen>
is set (if C<retlen> isn't NULL) so that (S<C<s> + C<*retlen>>) is the
next possible position in C<s> that could begin a non-malformed character.
See L</utf8n_to_uvuni> for details on when the REPLACEMENT CHARACTER is returned.

bytes available. The return value is the pointer to the byte after the

Adds the UTF-8 representation of the code point C<uv> to the end
of the string C<d>; C<d> should have at least C<UTF8_MAXBYTES+1> free
bytes available. The return value is the pointer to the byte after the
end of the new character. In other words,

    d = uvuni_to_utf8_flags(d, uv, flags);

or, in most cases,

    d = uvuni_to_utf8(d, uv);

(which is equivalent to)

    d = uvuni_to_utf8_flags(d, uv, 0);

This is the recommended Unicode-aware way of saying

    *(d++) = uv;

This function will convert to UTF-8 (and not warn) even code points that aren't
legal Unicode or are problematic, unless C<flags> contains one or more of the
following flags:

If C<uv> is a Unicode surrogate code point and UNICODE_WARN_SURROGATE is set,
the function will raise a warning, provided UTF8 warnings are enabled.  If instead
UNICODE_DISALLOW_SURROGATE is set, the function will fail and return NULL.
If both flags are set, the function will both warn and return NULL.

The UNICODE_WARN_NONCHAR and UNICODE_DISALLOW_NONCHAR flags correspondingly
affect how the function handles a Unicode non-character.  And, likewise for the
UNICODE_WARN_SUPER and UNICODE_DISALLOW_SUPER flags, and code points that are
above the Unicode maximum of 0x10FFFF.  Code points above 0x7FFF_FFFF (which are
even less portable) can be warned and/or disallowed even if other above-Unicode
code points are accepted by the UNICODE_WARN_FE_FF and UNICODE_DISALLOW_FE_FF
flags.

And finally, the flag UNICODE_WARN_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE selects all four of the
above WARN flags; and UNICODE_DISALLOW_ILLEGAL_INTERCHANGE selects all four
DISALLOW flags.

This is an XS interface to Perl's C<die> function.

Take a sprintf-style format pattern and argument list.  These are used to
generate a string message.  If the message does not end with a newline,
then it will be extended with some indication of the current location
in the code, as described for L</mess_sv>.

The error message will be used as an exception, by default
returning control to the nearest enclosing C<eval>, but subject to
modification by a C<$SIG{__DIE__}> handler.  In any case, the C<croak>
function never returns normally.

For historical reasons, if C<pat> is null then the contents of C<ERRSV>
(C<$@>) will be used as an error message or object instead of building an
error message from arguments.  If you want to throw a non-string object,
