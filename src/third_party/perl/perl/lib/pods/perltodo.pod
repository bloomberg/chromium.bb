=head1 NAME

perltodo - Perl TO-DO List

=head1 DESCRIPTION

We no longer install the Perl 5 to-do list as a manpage, as installing
snapshot that becomes increasingly out of date isn't that useful to anyone.
The current Perl 5 to-do list is maintained in the git repository, and can
be viewed at L<http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/blob/HEAD:/Porting/todo.pod>
