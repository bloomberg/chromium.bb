                    cpanid  => 'JACKASH',

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<CPANPLUS::Module::Author> creates objects from the information in the
source files. These can then be used to query on.

These objects should only be created internally. For C<fake> objects,
there's the C<CPANPLUS::Module::Author::Fake> class.

=head1 ACCESSORS

An objects of this class has the following accessors:

=over 4

=item author

Name of the author.

=item cpanid

The CPAN id of the author.

=item email

The email address of the author, which defaults to '' if not provided.

=item parent

The C<CPANPLUS::Internals::Object> that spawned this module object.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $auth = CPANPLUS::Module::Author->new( author => AUTHOR_NAME, cpanid => CPAN_ID, _id => INTERNALS_ID [, email => AUTHOR_EMAIL] )

This method returns a C<CPANPLUS::Module::Author> object, based on the given
parameters.

Returns false on failure.
