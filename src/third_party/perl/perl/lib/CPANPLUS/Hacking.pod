=head1 NAME

CPANPLUS::Hacking - developing CPANPLUS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document attempts to describe how to develop with the
CPANPLUS environment most easily, how certain things work and why.

This is basically a quick-start guide to people who want to add
features or patches to CPANPLUS.

=head1 OBTAINING CPANPLUS

Checkout CPANPLUS from its GIT repository at
L<https://github.com/jib/cpanplus-devel> .

=head1 INSTALLING CPANPLUS

CPANPLUS follows the standard perl module installation process:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

=head1 CONFIGURING CPANPLUS

When running C<perl Makefile.PL> you will be prompted to configure.
If you have already done so, and merely wish to update the C<Makefile>,
simply run:

    perl Makefile.PL JFDI=1

This will keep your configuration intact. Note however, if there are
changes to the default configuration file C<Config.pm-orig>, you should
either delete your current config file and reconfigure, or patch your
config file from the new entries in C<Config.pm-orig>.

=head1 RUNNING CPANPLUS FROM DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

If you'd rather not install the development version to your
C<site_perl> directory, that's no problem. You can set your C<PERL5LIB>
environment variable to CPANPLUS' C<lib> directory, and you can run it
from there.

=head1 RUNNING CPANPLUS TESTS

Tests are what tells us if CPANPLUS is working. If a test is not working,
try to run it explicitly like this:

    perl -I/path/to/cpanplus/lib t/XX_name_of_test.t 1

The extra '1' makes sure that all the messages and errors (they might
be errors we're testing for!) are being printed rather than kept quiet.
This is a great way to find out the context of any failures that may
occur.

If you believe this test failure proves a bug in CPANPLUS, the long
output of the test file is something we'd like to see alongside your
bug report.

=head1 FINDING BUGS

Sometimes you might find bugs in CPANPLUS' behaviour. If you encounter
these in a development snapshot, we'd appreciate a complete patch (as
described below in the L<SENDING PATCHES> section.

If it's way over your head, then of course reporting the bug is always
better than not reporting it at all. Before you do so though, make
sure you have the B<latest> development snapshot, and the bug still
persists there. If so, report the bug to this address:

    bug-cpanplus@rt.cpan.org

A good C<patch> would have the following characteristics:

=over 4

=item Problem description

Describe clearly what the bug is you found, and what it should have
done instead.

=item Program demonstrating the bug

Show us how to reproduce the bug, in a simple of a program as possible

=item [OPTIONAL] A patch to the test suite to test for the bug

Amend our test suite by making sure this bug will be found in this, and
future versions of CPANPLUS (see L<SUPPLYING PATCHES>)

=item [OPTIONAL] A patch to the code + tests + documentation

Fix the bug, update the docs & tests. That way your bug will be gone
forever :)

=back

=head1 SUPPLYING PATCHES

Patches are a good thing, and they are welcome. Especially if they fix
bugs you've found along the way, or that others have reported.

We prefer patches in the following format:

=over 4

=item * In C<diff -u> or C<diff -c> format

=item * From the root of the snapshot

=item * Including patches for code + tests + docs

=item * Sent per mail to bug-cpanplus@rt.cpan.org

=item * With subject containing C<[PATCH]> + description of the patch

=back

You will always be informed if a patch is applied or rejected, and in
case of rejection why that is (perhaps you can tweak the patch to have
it accepted after all).
