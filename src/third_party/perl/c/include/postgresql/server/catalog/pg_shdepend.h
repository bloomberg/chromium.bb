 * pg_shdepend.h
 *	  definition of the "shared dependency" system catalog (pg_shdepend)
 *
 * pg_shdepend has no preloaded contents, so there is no pg_shdepend.dat
 * file; system-defined dependencies are loaded into it during a late stage
 * of the initdb process.
 *
 * NOTE: we do not represent all possible dependency pairs in pg_shdepend;
 * for example, there's not much value in creating an explicit dependency
 * from a relation to its database.  Currently, only dependencies on roles
 * are explicitly stored in pg_shdepend.
