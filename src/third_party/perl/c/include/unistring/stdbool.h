/* ISO C 99 <stdbool.h> for platforms that lack it.  */

/* Usage suggestions:

   Programs that use <stdbool.h> should be aware of some limitations
   and standards compliance issues.

   Standards compliance:

       - <stdbool.h> must be #included before 'bool', 'false', 'true'
         can be used.

       - You cannot assume that sizeof (bool) == 1.

       - Programs should not undefine the macros bool, true, and false,
         as C99 lists that as an "obsolescent feature".

   Limitations of this substitute, when used in a C89 environment:

       - <stdbool.h> must be #included before the '_Bool' type can be used.

       - You cannot assume that _Bool is a typedef; it might be a macro.

       - Bit-fields of type 'bool' are not supported.  Portable code
         should use 'unsigned int foo : 1;' rather than 'bool foo : 1;'.

       - In C99, casts and automatic conversions to '_Bool' or 'bool' are
         performed in such a way that every nonzero value gets converted
         to 'true', and zero gets converted to 'false'.  This doesn't work
         with this substitute.  With this substitute, only the values 0 and 1
         give the expected result when converted to _Bool' or 'bool'.

       - C99 allows the use of (_Bool)0.0 in constant expressions, but
         this substitute cannot always provide this property.

   Also, it is suggested that programs use 'bool' rather than '_Bool';
   this isn't required, but 'bool' is more common.  */
