This package contains the GNU Bison parser generator.

See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation instructions.

See the section FAQ in the documentation (doc/bison.info) for
frequently asked questions.  The documentation is also available in
PDF and HTML, provided you have a recent version of Texinfo installed:
run "make pdf" or "make html".

Bison requires GNU m4 1.4.6 or later.  See:

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/m4/m4-1.4.6.tar.gz

Bison can work with pre-1.4.6 distributions of GNU m4 if they are
sufficiently patched, but if you encounter a bug with an older
distribution and report a bug we will probably suggest that you
upgrade to 1.4.6 as the first step in trying to fix it.

Please send bug reports to <bug-bison@gnu.org>.  Please include the
version number from `bison --version', and a complete, self-contained
test case in each bug report.

If you have questions about using Bison and the documentation does
not answer them, please send mail to <help-bison@gnu.org>.
