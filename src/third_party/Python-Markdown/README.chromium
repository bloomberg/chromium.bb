Description:

Python-Markdown is a pure Python parser for Markdown.

//tools/md_browser uses it to provide a local previewer for our
Markdown-based documentation.

This code is not considered security critical since it is only used by
developer utilities. This should never be linked into chrome or any production
code.

To update this, do something roughly along the lines of:

    cd ..
    wget $URL # A newer version of the above URL
    tar xvzf Markdown-$VERSION.tar.gz
    cd Markdown-$VERSION
    rm -fr setup.py setup.cfg makefile MANIFEST.in PKG-INFO Markdown.egg-info \
           pyproject.toml tests doc-requirements.txt docs mkdocs.yml INSTALL.md
    cp ../README.chromium ./

    # update the version numbers in README.chromium

    cd ../
    rm -fr markdown/
    mv Markdown-$VERSION/* ./
