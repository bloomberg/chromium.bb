Description:
  This contains the GIF encoder classes from the Glide library, which were themselves based on the
  GIF encoding logic found here: http://java2s.com/Code/Java/2D-Graphics-GUI/AnimatedGifEncoder.htm.
  The README.third_party file in the Glide repo has more info.

Local Modifications:
- Changed the name of the top-level package from "com.bumptech.glide.gifencoder" to
  "org.chromium.third_party.glide.gif_encoder" to avoid potential conflicts with the Glide library.
