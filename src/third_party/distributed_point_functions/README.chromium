Description:
This library contains an implementation of incremental distributed point
functions, based on the paper by Boneh et al.

Local Modifications:
The directory code/ is an unchanged copy of the source code other than the
addition of a .clang-format file to disable automatic code formatting. Parts of
code/dpf/distributed_point_function_test.cc are also adapted for fuzzing in
fuzz/dpf_fuzzer.cc.

The source code pulled in depends on "glog/logging.h" which is not accessible
from chromium. As a workaround, we create a simple glog/logging.h that includes
the macros needed.
