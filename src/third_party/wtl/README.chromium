These headers are almost the equivalent of WTL 8.0 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/wtl/
with patch #1871358 applied.
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1871358&group_id=109071&atid=652374

"Fixes support for building with NOMINMAX defined.
When defining NOMINMAX before including windows.h, min and max aren't
defined. __min and __max are always defined though. So use them instead.

This patch simply consist of a search of replace for both term."
