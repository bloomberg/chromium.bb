Description:
The ARCore Android SDK provides augmented reality capabilities to Android
devices.

Local Modifications:
To address binary size concerns, we are using a minimal shim produced for
Chromium that is not publicly distributed elsewhere. We have also stripped the
.so's to minimize their size.

Also, added BUILD.gn for compilation in chrome.

Added the test-apks/ subdirectory for storing production versions of AR APKs,
namely ArCore, for testing.

IMPORTANT: make sure to change chrome/android/java/AndroidManifest.xml
com.google.ar.core.min_apk_version attribute if a newer version of the
ARCore APK is required to maintain compatibility with this SDK.

Changes:
2018-09-14 - Upgrade test-apks/arcore_current.apk to v1.4.
2018-08-10 - First, removed arcore shim copy target from BUILD.gn since it is no
             longer needed. Second, added zero-byte dummy arcore library for AR
             module support.
2018-07-26 - Added test-apks/ subdirectory for storing production versions of AR
             APKs for testing.
2018-07-19 - Updated BUILD.gn to support secondary abi (the previous change for
             arm64 support turned out to be insufficient) and removed the unused
             libarcore_sdk target.
2018-05-04 - Updated BUILD.gn to work properly for arm64.
