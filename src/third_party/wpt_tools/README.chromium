Description: This includes code for the manifest tool, lint tool, and wptserve.
    Used to run all supported web-platform-tests as part of Blink
    web tests. The wpt/wpt directory only contains the tools, whereas
    web_tests/external/wpt contains the tests. Also see wpt/README.chromium
    for more details on maintenance.
Local Modifications:
- Removed all files except for those listed in wpt/WPTIncludeList.
- Local patch to work-around error where maybe_parse_tombstone is missing
  a parameter.
- wpt.config.json defined to align with Blink web test runner setup.
