## What is Android WebView?

Android WebView is an Android system component for display web content. This
(and the related Android classes) are implemented by the code in the
`//android_webview/` folder.

Android WebView is a content embedder, meaning it depends on code in
`//content/` and lower layers (ex. `//net/`, `//base/`), but does not depend on
sibling layers such as `//chrome/`.

## Want to use WebView in an Android app?
