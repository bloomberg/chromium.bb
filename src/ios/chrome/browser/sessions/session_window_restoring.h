// Restores the |window| (for example, after a crash). If there is only one tab,
// showing the NTP, then this tab should be clobbered, otherwise, the tabs from

// conducted during the restore and must be called before any observers are
// registered on the TabModel.  Returns YES if the single NTP tab is closed.
