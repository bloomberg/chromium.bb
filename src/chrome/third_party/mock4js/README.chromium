Mock4JS is a dynamic-mock library for Javascript. It enables developers to write
tests that exercise and verify the interactions between the objects in the
application. Its syntax is very expressive and is closely based on jMock 1.

Local Modifications:
* Replace a fail() call with throwing Mock4JSException.
