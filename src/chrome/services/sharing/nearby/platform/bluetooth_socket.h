// Concrete BluetoothSocket implementation.
//
// Nearby Connections uses this BluetoothSocket to communicate with a remote
// device. At a high-level, it first exchanges frames to encrypt the connection,
// then delegates to its caller (e.g., Nearby Share) to authenticate the
// connection, and finally expects its caller to send and receive
// application-level messages. The following precautions are taken to handle
// untrusted bytes received from remote devices:
//   * Nearby Connections (which this class is a piece of) is hosted in a
//     Nearby utility process.
//   * Whenever Nearby Connections provides bytes received from a remote device
//     to its caller, even after it has been authenticated, the caller must not
//     trust those bytes, and is responsible for first passing those bytes
//     through the trusted NearbyDecoder interface (see go/nearby-chrome-mojo).
//     NearbyDecoder is hosted in the same Nearby utility process.
//
// api::BluetoothSocket is a synchronous interface, so this implementation
// consumes the synchronous signatures of bluetooth::mojom::Socket methods.
//
// api::BluetoothSocket's subclasses are also synchronous interfaces, but the
// Mojo DataPipes they consume only provide asynchronous interfaces. This is
// reconciled by blocking on the caller thread when waiting (via a
// mojo::SimpleWatcher) for the DataPipes to become readable or writable (this
// is expected by the callers of api::BluetoothSocket's subclasses). Mojo
// DataPipe operations are handled on a separate task runner (see
// |task_runner_|) so that blocking on the calling thread will not deadlock.
