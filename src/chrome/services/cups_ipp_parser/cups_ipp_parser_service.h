// CupsIppParser Service Implementation.
//
// This service's sole purpose is parsing CUPS IPP printing requests. It accepts
// arbitrary byte buffers as input and returns a fully-parsed IPP request,
// mojom::IppRequest, as a result.
//
// Because this service doesn't know the origin of these requests, it
// treats each request as potentially malicious. As such, this service runs
// out-of-process, lessening the chance of exposing an exploit to the rest of
// Chrome.
//
// Note: In practice, this service is used to support printing requests incoming
// from ChromeOS.
