Description:

A set of Python functions for interacting with the Pololu Maestro series of
servo controllers, which are used for automated VR motion-to-photon latency
testing. This is simply a Python implementation of the commands described in the
official documentation at https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J40/5.e, using PySerial
for communicating with the controller.

This code is not considered security critical since it is only to be used by
test binaries! This should never be used by Chrome or any production code.
