 * We use this annotation to tell where WPR archive file to load from for each

 * Note the archive is a relative path from src/.
 *
 * New tests should also annotate with "WPRRecordReplayTest" in @Feature.
 *
 * For instance, if file_foo is used in test A, file_bar is used
 * in test B.

 *
 * During gClient runhooks, the files in /path_of_file_foo and /path_of_file_bar
 * are downloaded from GCS. Once the files are downloaded, it will be used in
 * tests as isolated.
