This directory is created to hold test data for Firefox importer browser tests.

Since Firefox 3.5, instead of search.sqlite, all search engines are stored in
search.json. The test data in this directory is intended for Firefox 3.5 and
later.

The search.json is grabbed from profile directory of Firefox 28.0 that runs in
Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS. To make this test search.json light weight, the keys
|_iconURL| and |_iconMapObj| are removed from each search engines' dictionary.
Moreover, each list of |engines| is updated to respect existing
|kFirefoxKeywords|. Please NOTE that values of |filePath| is dependant on
workstation. The values of |filePath| are location of XML files for Firefox
search engines. All test XML files can be found in
/src/chrome/test/data/firefox_searchplugins directory. The directory contains
two sub-directories, namely |default| and |custom|. XML files for "default" and
"custom/installed" search engines are placed in |default| and |custom|
sub-directory respectively.

All other files are grabbed from
/src/chrome/test/data/firefox35_profile because

1) They respect the existing |kFirefoxBookmarks|, |kFirefoxPasswords|
of firefox_importer_browsertests.cc.
2) Unlike search.sqlite, their behavior have not changed.
