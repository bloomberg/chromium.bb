# While the overall structure of MHTML always uses CRLF, the MHTML parts
# that use binary encoding will preserve their original line endings
# (i.e. LF in case of the file below).  We tell git to treat these files
# as "binary" to preserve this weird mixture of CRLF and LF line endings.
*.mhtml binary

# Test.mhtml is quoted-printable so all the line endings can be crlf.
test.mhtml text eol=crlf
