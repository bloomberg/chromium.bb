  <h1>Site A</h1>
  Service worker returns a response object if it's offline, so the page
  supports the offline environment.

  This site is intended to be served at the root of a server to allow
  isolation. Thus the scope of the serviceworker and resources is at the root,
  and not in the sub directory here.
