// The purpose of this class is to take data from memory, store it to disk as
// temp files and keep them alive long enough to hand over to external entities,
// such as the Action Center on Windows. The Action Center will read the files
// at some point in the future, which is why we can't do:
//   [write file] -> [show notification] -> [delete file].
//
// Also, on Windows, temp file deletion is not guaranteed and, since the images
// can potentially be large, this presents a problem because Chrome might then
// be leaving chunks of dead bits lying around on userâ€™s computers during
// unclean shutdowns.
