This directory stores files related to Chrome's Page Annotations Service.

Page Annotations Service is a URL-to-metadata mapping service where the metadata
(aka annotations) can be generated on either the client or the server side. The
service abstracts the details of the data acquisition and maintenance and
exposes a simple URL lookup interface for consumers.
