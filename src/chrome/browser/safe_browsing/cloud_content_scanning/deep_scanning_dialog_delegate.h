// scan happening in the given tab with an option to cancel the operation.

// If the UI is not enabled, then the dialog is not shown and the delegate
// proceeds as if all data (strings and files) have successfully passed the
// deep checks.  However the checks are still performed in the background and
// verdicts reported, implementing an audit-only mode.  The UI will be turned
// on once finalized.
