// This function takes the user through the browser FRE.
// 1) First, it checks whether the FRE flow can be skipped in the first place.
//    This is the case when sync consent is already given (true for existing
//    users that migrated to lacros) or when enterprise policies forbid the FRE.
//    If so, the call directly 'finishes' the flow (see below).
// 2) Then, it opens the FRE UI (in the profile picker window) and
//    asynchronously 'finishes' the flow (sets a flag in the local prefs) once
//    the user chooses any action on the sync consent screen. If the user exits
//    the FRE UI via the generic 'Close window' affordances, it is interpreted
//    as an intent to exit the app and `callback` will be called with `proceed`
//    set to false. If they exit it via the dedicated options in the flow, it
//    will be considered 'completed' and `callback` will be run with `proceed`
//    set to true. If the FRE flow is exited before the sync consent screen, the
//    flow is considered 'aborted', and can be shown again at the next startup.
// When this method is called again while FRE is in progress, the new `callback`
// is aborted (called with false) right away.
