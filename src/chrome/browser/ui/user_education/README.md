# Desktop User Education

This directory contains code related to user education efforts on desktop. Also
see [//chrome/browser/ui/views/user_education](../views/user_education)

Active projects:
* In-product help (IPH): help dialogs offered by Chrome suggesting useful
  features. These are triggered automatically based on user behavior and give a 
  short value statement and directions to use the feature
* New badge: pop-out label applied to new features' entry points to make them
  more obvious
* Tutorials: step-by-step guided walkthroughs of features. User-initiated and
  more thorough than single-step IPH promotions

TODO(https://crbug.com/1132335): add overview and thorough instructions on how
to apply user education to features
