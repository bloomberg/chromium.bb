// ScoreNormalizer is responsible for normalizing relevance scores of search
// results from providers. It learns to transform all scores to a uniformly
// distributed normalized score between 0 to 1. The launcher takes scores of
// results from many providers, these all have different distributions and
// ranges, which makes them difficult to compare. After normalizing the
// relevance scores can be compared and ranked in the launcher. This class
// should only be initialized in a provider class where it can be called to
// record and normalize scores.
//
// To normalize scores the ScoreNormalizer uses a BalancedReservoir. The
// BalancedReservoir stores a subset of the search result scores, this subset of
// scores is called dividers. To normalize a score, the quantile of that score
// in the dividers is returned, this is always a value in (0,1). If a normalized
// score of 1 is returned, this is either due to empty dividers or index out of
// range when finding which index the score is in the dividers. The dividers are
// updated such that the counts of scores observed between each divider remains
// balanced. Each pair of adjacent dividers forms a histogram bin. To ensure
// bins remain balanced with each new score added bins are:
// 1. Split by adding the new score in between dividers.
// 2. Smallest bins are then merged.
// The L2 error is calculated to ensure splits and merges improve the balance of
// the reservoir.
//
// Use of the ScoreNormalizer:
// - Initialization. A profile is required since information about the provider
// scores in the BalancedReservoir class are stored in prefs. The reservoir size
// can be set to 25, or any other positive integer.
// - RecordResults() should be called right before new results are swapped in
// for old results in the providers. This updates the BalancedReservoir with the
// provider's score distribution.
// - NormalizeResults() should then be called. This changes the relevance scores
// of the ChromeSearchResult in place with the normalized score.
//
// TODO(crbug.com/1199206): Make the NormalizeResults take a
// std::vector<ChromSearchResult*>& rather than a
// std::vector<std::unique_ptr<ChromeSearchResult>> to give more flexibility on
// what it can normalize.
