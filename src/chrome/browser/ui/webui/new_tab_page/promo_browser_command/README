This directory contains the Desktop implementations of the promo browser
commands located at:
//chrome/browser/promo_browser_command/promo_browser_command.mojom

For every new implemented command, add unit tests as well as an entry to
chrome://flags/#promo-browser-commands for end-to-end testing of the command.

All changes to this directory should be run by //ipc/SECURITY_OWNERS in addition
to the NTP owners in order to ensure the implementations of the promo browser
commands are side-effect-free.
