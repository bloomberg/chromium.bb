// Empties the working set of processes in which all frames are frozen.
//
// Objective #1: Track working set growth rate.
//   Swap trashing occurs when a lot of pages are accessed in a short period of
//   time. Swap trashing can be reduced by reducing the number of pages accessed
//   by processes in which all frames are frozen. To track efforts towards this
//   goal, we empty the working set of processes when all their frames become
//   frozen and record the size of their working set after x minutes.
//   TODO(fdoray): Record the working set size x minutes after emptying it.
//   https://crbug.com/885293
//
// Objective #2: Improve performance.
//   We hypothesize that emptying the working set of a process causes its pages
//   to be compressed and/or written to disk preemptively, which makes more
//   memory available quickly for foreground processes and improves global
//   browser performance.
