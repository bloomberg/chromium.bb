  // Hack to hide the settings app from the app list search box. This is only
  // intended to be used in tests.
  //
  // BuiltInChromeOsApps assumes that the list of internal apps doesn't change
  // over the lifetime of the Profile. For example,
  // chrome/browser/ui/app_list/internal_app/internal_app_metadata.{cc,h}
  // doesn't expose any observer mechanism to be notified if it did change.
  //
  // Separately, WebAppUiServiceMigrationBrowserTest's
  // SettingsSystemWebAppMigration test exercises the case where the
  // *implementation* of the built-in Settings app changes, from an older
  // technology to being a Web App. Even though there are two implementations,
  // any given Profile will typically use only one, depending on whether
  // features::kSystemWebApps is enabled, typically via the command line.
  // Again, the App Service's BuiltInChromeOsApps handles this, in practice, as
  // whether or not it's enabled ought to stay unchanged throughout a session.
  //
  // Specifically, though, that test (1) starts with features::kSystemWebApps
  // disabled (during SetUp) but then (2) enables it (during the test
  // function). This isn't in order to explicitly exercise a run-time flag
  // change, but it was simply an expedient way to test data migration:
  // situation (1) creates some persistent data (in the test's temporary
  // storage) in the old implementation's format, and flipping to situation (2)
  // checks that the new implementation correctly migrates that data.
  //
  // An unfortunate side effect of that flip is that the list of internal apps
  // changed. The SettingsSystemWebAppMigration test involves an
  // AppListModelUpdater, which calls into its AppSearchProvider's and thus the
  // App Service (when the App Service is enabled), which then panics because a
  // built-in app it previously knew about and exposed via app list search, in
  // situation (1), has mysteriously vanished, in situation (2).
  //
  // A 'proper' fix could be to add an observer mechanism to the list of
  // internal apps, and break the previously held simplifying assumption that
  // BuiltInChromeOsApps can be relatively stateless as that list does not
  // change. There's also some subtlety because App Service methods are
  // generally asynchronous (because they're potentially Mojo IPC), so some
  // care still needs to be taken where some parts of the system might have
  // seen any given app update but others might not yet have.
  //
  // Doing a 'proper' fix is probably more trouble than it's worth. Given that
  // this "change the implementation of the built-in Settings app" will only
  // temporarily have two separate implementations, say for a couple of months,
  // and a runtime flag flip isn't supported in production, and is only
  // exercised in a single test, the simpler (temporary) fix is to opt in to
  // hiding the internal Settings app from search.
  //
  // Note that we only hide it from search. We don't remove the app entirely
  // from the list of apps that the BuiltInChromeOsApps publishes, since the
  // migration test (and its AppListModelUpdater) still needs to be able to
  // refer to the (artificial) situation where both apps co-exist.
  //
  // TODO(calamity/nigeltao): remove this hack once the System Web App has
  // completely replaced the Settings Internal App, hopefully some time in
  // 2019Q3.
  //
  // See also the "web_app::SystemWebAppManager::IsEnabled()" if-check in
  // internal_app_metadata.cc. Once that condition is removed, we can probably
  // remove this hack too.
