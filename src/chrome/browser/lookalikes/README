Files related to the Lookalike URL warning.

This interstitial is triggered when a user visits a domain that is similar to
that of a domain of a popular site.

It does not trigger on sites that are likely to be non-malicious, such as
popular sites, sites with a higher site engagement scores, or sites whose domain
names are quite short.
