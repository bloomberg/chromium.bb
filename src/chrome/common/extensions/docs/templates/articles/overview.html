<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>
  Extensions are zipped bundles of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images,
  and other files used in the web platform,
  that customize the Google Chrome browsing experience.
  Extensions are built using web technology
  and can use the same APIs
  the browser provides to the open web.
</p>

<p>
  Extensions have a wide range of functional possibilities.
  They can modify web content users see
  and interact with or
  extend and change the behavior of the browser itself.
</p>

<p>
  Consider extensions the gateway to making the Chrome browser
  the most personalized browser.
</a>

<h2 id="files">Extension Files</h2>

<p>
  Extensions vary in types of files and amount of directories,
  but they are all required to have a
  <a href="extensions/manifest">manifest</a>.
  Some basic, but useful,
  extensions may consist of just the manifest and its toolbar icon.
</p>

<p>
  The manifest file, titled <code>manifest.json</code>,
  gives the browser information about the extension,
  such as the most important files and the capabilities the extension might use.
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  {
    "name": "My Extension",
    "version": "2.1",
    "description": "Gets information from Google.",
    "icons": {
      "128": "icon_16.png",
      "128": "icon_32.png",
      "128": "icon_48.png",
      "128": "icon_128.png"
    },
    "background": {
      "persistent": false,
      "scripts": ["background_script.js"]
    },
    "permissions": ["https://*.google.com/", "activeTab"],
    "browser_action": {
      "default_icon": "icon_16.png",
      "default_popup": "popup.html"
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>
  Extensions must have an icon that sits in the browser toolbar.
  Toolbar icons allow easy access and
  keep users aware of which extensions are installed.
  Most users will interact with an extension that uses a
  <a href="user_interface#popup">popup</a> by clicking on the icon.
</p>

    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h3 id="relative-urls">Referring to files</h3>

<p>
  An extension's files can be referred to by using a relative URL,
  just as files in an ordinary HTML page.
</p>

<pre>
  &lt;img <b>src="images/my_image.png"</b>>
</pre>

<p>
  Additionally, each file can also be accessed using an absolute URL.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>chrome-extension://</b><em>&lt;extensionID&gt;</em><b>/</b><em>&lt;pathToFile&gt;</em>
</blockquote>

<p>
  In the absolute URL, the <em>&lt;extensionID&gt;</em> is a unique identifier
  that the extension system generates for each extension.
  The IDs for all loaded extensions can be viewed
  by going to the URL <b>chrome://extensions</b>.
  The <em>&lt;pathToFile&gt;</em> is the location of the file
  under the extension's top folder;
  it matches the relative URL.
</p>

<p>
  While working on an unpacked extension
  the extension ID can change.
  Specifically, the ID of an unpacked extension will change
  if the extension is loaded from a different directory;
  the ID will change again when the extension is packaged.
  If an extension's code relies on an absolute URL,
  it can use the
  <a href="extensions/runtime#method-getURL">
    <code>chrome.runtime.getURL()</code>
  </a>
  method to avoid hardcoding the ID during development.
</p>

<h2 id="arch">Architecture</h2>
<p>
  An extension’s architecture will depend on its functionality,
  but many robust extensions will include multiple components:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="extensions/manifest">Manifest</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#background_script">Background Script</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#pages">UI Elements</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#contentScripts">Content Script</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#optionsPage">Options Page</a>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="background_script">Background Script</h3>

<p>
  The <a href="/background_pages">background script</a> is the extension's
  event handler; it contains listeners
  for browser events that are important to the extension.
  It lies dormant until an event is fired then performs the instructed logic.
  An effective background script is only loaded when it is needed
  and unloaded when it goes idle.
</p>

<h3 id="pages">UI Elements</h3>

<p>
  An <a href="user_interface">extension's user interface</a>
  should be purposeful and minimal.
  The UI should customize or enhance the browsing experience
  without distracting from it.
  Most extensions have a <a href="browserAction">browser action</a> or
  <a href="pageAction">page action</a>,
  but can contain other forms of UI,
  such as <a href="/contextMenus">context menus</a>,
  use of the <a href="omniBox">omnibox</a>,
  or creation of a <a href="commands">keyboard shortcut</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Extension UI pages,
  such as a <a href="user_interface#popup">popup</a>,
  can contain ordinary HTML pages with JavaScript logic.
  Extensions can also call <a href="tabs#method-create">tabs.create</a> or
  <code>window.open()</code> to display additional HTML files present
  in the extension.
</p>
<p>
  An extension using a page action and a popup
  can use the <a href="declarativeContent">declarative content</a> API to set
  rules in the background script
  for when the popup is available to users.
  When the conditions are met,
  the background script communicates with the popup
  to make it’s icon clickable to users.
</p>

<img src="{{static}}/images/overview/popuparc.png"
 alt="A browser window containing a page action displaying a popup." />

<h3 id="contentScripts">Content scripts</h3>

<p>
  Extensions that read or write to web pages utilize a
  <a href="content_scripts">content script</a>.
  The content script contains JavaScript that executes in the contexts of a page
  that has been loaded into the browser.
  Content scripts read and modify the DOM of web pages the browser visits.
</p>

<img src="{{static}}/images/overview/contentscriptarc.png"
 alt="A browser window with a page action and a content script." />

<p>
  Content scripts can communicate with their parent extension
  by exchanging <a href="messaging">messages</a> and storing values using the
  <a href="storage">storage</a> API.
</p>

<img src="{{static}}/images/overview/messagingarc.png"
 alt="Shows a communication path between the content script and the parent extension." />

<h3 id="optionsPage">Options Page</h3>

<p>
  Just as extensions allow users to customize the Chrome browser,
  the <a href="options">options page</a> enables customization of the extension.
  Options can be used to enable features and allow users
  to choose what functionality is relevant to their needs.
</p>

<h2 id="apis">Using Chrome APIs</h2>

<p>
  In addition to having access to the same APIs as web pages,
  extensions can also use <a href="api_index">extension-specific APIs</a>
  that create tight integration with the browser.
  Extensions and webpages can both access the standard
  <code>window.open()</code> method to open a URL,
  but extensions can specify which window that URL should be displayed in
  by using the Chrome API <a href="tabs#method-create">tabs.create</a>
  method instead.
</p>

<h3 id="sync"> Asynchronous vs. synchronous methods </h3>
<p>
  Most Chrome API methods are asynchronous:
  they return immediately without waiting for the operation to finish.
  If an extension needs to know the outcome of an asynchronous operation
  it can pass a callback function into the method.
  The callback is executed later, potentially much later,
  after the method returns.
</p>

<p>
  If the extension needed to navigate the user’s currently selected tab
  to a new URL, it would need to get the current tab’s ID
  and then update that tab’s address to the new URL.
</p>
<p>
  If the <a href="/tabs#method-query">tabs.query</a> method were synchronous,
  it may look something like below.
</p>

<pre>
  <b>//THIS CODE DOESN'T WORK</b>
  var tab = chrome.tabs.query({'active': true}); <b>//WRONG!!!</b>
  chrome.tabs.update(tab.id, {url:newUrl});
  someOtherFunction();
</pre>

<p>
  This approach will fail because <code>query()</code> is asynchronous.
  It returns without waiting for the work to complete,
  and does not return a value.
  A method is asynchronous when the callback parameter is available
  in its signature.
</p>

<pre>
  // Signature for an asynchronous method
  chrome.tabs.query(object <em>queryInfo</em>, function <em>callback</em>)
</pre>

<p>
  To correctly query a tab and update its URL
  the extension must use the callback parameter.
</p>

<pre>
  <b>//THIS CODE WORKS</b>
  chrome.tabs.query({'active': true}, <b>function(tabs) {</b>
    chrome.tabs.update(tabs[0].id, {url: newUrl});
  <b>}</b>);
  someOtherFunction();
</pre>

<p>
  In the above code, the lines are executed in the following order: 1, 4, 2.
  The callback function specified to <code>query()</code> is called
  and then executes line 2,
  but only after information about the currently selected tab is available.
  This happens sometime after <code>query()</code> returns.
  Although <code>update()</code> is asynchronous
  the code doesn’t use a callback parameter,
  since the extension doesn’t do anything with the results of the update.
</p>

<pre>
  // Synchronous methods have no callback option and returns a type of string
  <em>string</em> chrome.runtime.getURL()
</pre>

<p>
  This method synchronously returns the URL as a <code>string</code>
  and performs no other asynchronous work.
</p>

  <a href="api_index">Chrome API reference docs</a>
  and watch the following video.

</div>

<h2 id="pageComm">Communication between pages </h2>
<p>
  Different components in an extension
  often need to communicate with each other.
  Different HTML pages can find each other by using the
  <a href="extension"><code>chrome.extension</code></a> methods,
  such as <code>getViews()</code> and <code>getBackgroundPage()</code>.
  Once a page has a reference to other extension pages
  the first one can invoke functions on the other pages
  and manipulate their DOMs.
  Additionally, all components of the extension can access values stored
  using the <a href="storage">storage</a> API
  and communicate through <a href="messaging">message passing</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="incognito"> Saving data and incognito mode </h2>

<p>
  Extensions can save data using the $(ref:storage) API,
  the HTML5
  <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webstorage.html">
    web storage API
  </a>, or by making server requests that result in saving data.
  When the extension needs to save something,
  first consider if it's from an incognito window.
  By default, extensions don't run in incognito windows.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Incognito mode</em> promises that the window will leave no tracks.
  When dealing with data from incognito windows,
  extensions should honor this promise.
  If an extension normally saves browsing history,
  don't save history from incognito windows.
  However, extensions can store setting preferences from any window,
  incognito or not.
</p>

<p>
  To detect whether a window is in incognito mode,
  check the <code>incognito</code> property of the relevant
  $(ref:tabs.Tab) or
  $(ref:windows.Window) object.
</p>

<pre>
function saveTabData(tab) {
  if (tab.incognito) {
    return;
  } else {
    chrome.storage.local.set({data: tab.url});
  }
}
</pre>
