<h1>Publish Your App</h1>

<p>Packaged apps are published in the same way as other types of apps in the Chrome Web Store.
For detailed instructions, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome/web-store/docs/publish">Publishing Your App</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong>
If your app uses <a href="https://developers.google.com/native-client/">Native Client</a>,
you can structure your application directory hierarchy and zip file in a way that reduces the size of the user download package.
For details, see
