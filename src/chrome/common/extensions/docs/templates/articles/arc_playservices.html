<h1>Enable Play Services in Your ARC App</h1>

<p>
This article talks about how to enable Google Play Services in
<a href="getstarted_arc">your ARC app</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="getstarted">Getting started</h2>
<p>
If your app uses
<a href="https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/plus.html">
Google+ sign-in</a>,
<a href="https://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html">
Google Cloud Messaging (GCM)</a>,
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/contacts-provider.html">
contacts provider</a>, or any of Google's OAuth 2 APIs, you need to set up
a project on the Google Developers Console.
<ol>
  <li>
    Go to the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com">Google Developers
    Console</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a project.  If you already have a project for your app, it is
    recommended to reuse it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure the information in <strong>APIs &amp; auth</strong> &gt;
    <strong>Consent screen</strong> is correct.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Make sure <strong>Product name</strong> is set correctly. This is what
        users will see when granting your app permissions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure <strong>Email address</strong> is set correctly. This is where
        users will send feedback. Note that it is a dropdown menu that contains
        the email addresses of project owners. If the appropriate email address
        is not in the list, you can add the account as an owner in the
        <strong>Permissions</strong> section from the left navigation pane.
        Click <strong>Add Member</strong>, then make sure <strong>Is
        owner</strong> is selected.
      </li>
      <li>Fill out the rest of the fields as necessary for your app.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Navigate to <strong>APIs &amp; auth</strong> &gt;
    <strong>Credentials</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Select <strong>Create new Client ID</strong>.</li>
      <li>
        Create a Client ID for an <strong>Installed application</strong> of type
        <strong>Chrome application</strong>.  <em>Note: Do not use "Android" as
        the application type.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        Paste in the ID assigned to your app from the Chrome Web Store.  See <a
        href="/webstore/publish#appId">Getting the app ID</a> for more
        details.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Copy the client ID assigned for your app and save it for <a
    href="#metadata">later</a>. It will look like:<br>
    <em>0123456789-randomstring.apps.googleusercontent.com</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Go to <strong>APIs &amp; auth</strong> &gt; <strong>APIs</strong>, turn on
    the APIs you need. For example:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Turn on <strong>Google Cloud Messaging for Chrome</strong> if your app
        uses GCM.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn on <strong>Contacts API</strong> if your app reads users' Google
        contacts from the contact provider.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h2 id="metadata">Setting Client ID and Metadata</h2>
<p>
To allow your app to use the APIs you have enabled, paste the oauth client ID
obtained above in the <strong>OAuth Client ID</strong> field in <a
href="http://goo.gl/gAn0Xh">ARC Welder</a>.
</p>
<p>
You also need to enable services explicitly using ARC-specific metadata. For
example, to use GCM and Google+ sign-on, your <strong>Additional
Metadata</strong> will look something like this:
</p>
<pre>
{
  "usePlayServices": ["gcm", "plus"]
}
</pre>
<p>
Available services are: ads, gcm, location, maps, plus.
</p>
<h3 id="localtesting">Advanced: Local testing</h3>
<p>
When testing using these APIs, it is important that your app ID locally matches
the app ID from the Chrome Web Store.  To do this, get the <strong>Public
key</strong> from the <strong>More info</strong> link in the <a
href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard">Chrome Web Store
Developer Dashboard</a>. The public key will look like this:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCwTjmSbBD9uFJEUR7jMYAL1sPX
qCNe7ljIb6dheKIYjkNtLt1YuiAw4Pul/PO+aYtm8tsbFnsNZ73AxhMX9aPxuzwl
Aak/iN6atxv7h8mwOg6HiHdxTDnOPrCv7fEud5aUFaq7sqDhiqwMpJoIOa1w7c29
9z3oXIrG1FGEkid1IQIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
</code>
</pre>
<p>
To use this public key for local testing, set <strong>Additional Metadata</strong>
in ARC Welder to:
</p>
<p>
<em>(merge this JSON with existing metadata from above)</em>:
</p>
<pre>
{
  "crx_key": "MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCwTjmSbBD9uFJEUR7jMYAL1sPX
qCNe7ljIb6dheKIYjkNtLt1YuiAw4Pul/PO+aYtm8tsbFnsNZ73AxhMX9aPxuzwl
Aak/iN6atxv7h8mwOg6HiHdxTDnOPrCv7fEud5aUFaq7sqDhiqwMpJoIOa1w7c29
9z3oXIrG1FGEkid1IQIDAQAB"
}
</pre>
<p>
<em>Note: Remove line breaks and whitespace in the public key, this must be
a contiguous
string</em>
</p>
<p>
If you have set the public key correctly, the next time you launch your app, it
will be loaded with the same ID as your Chrome Web Store app.  See
chrome://extensions with <strong>Developer mode</strong> selected to confirm.
</p>
<h2 id="version">Choose the right Google Play Services version</h2>
<p>
The version of Google Play Services included in ARC will not always be the very
latest version of Play Services that is available from Google Play and the
Android SDK. If the Play Services library your app uses is newer than the Play
Services in ARC, you will see a message from the ARC app to update Google Play
Services.
</p>
<p>
In this case, you will need to downgrade your SDK in order to target Play
Services in ARC. The Android SDK Manager always downloads the latest version of
Play Services, so we suggest backing up previous SDKs before updating, so that
you will be able to continue building APKs which work with ARC.
