<h1 id="web_accessible_resources">Manifest - Web Accessible Resources</h1>

<p>
An array of strings specifying the paths of packaged resources that are expected
to be usable in the context of a web page. These paths are relative to the package
root, and may contain wildcards.
For example, an extension that injects a content script with the intention of
building up some custom interface for <code>example.com</code> would allow
any resources that interface requires (images, icons, stylesheets, scripts,
etc.) as follows:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  ...
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    "images/*.png",
    "style/double-rainbow.css",
    "script/double-rainbow.js",
    "script/main.js",
    "templates/*"
  ],
  ...
}
</pre>

<p>
These resources would then be available in a webpage via the URL
<code>chrome-extension://[PACKAGE ID]/[PATH]</code>, which can be generated with
the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/extension#method-getURL">extension.getURL</a> method. Allowlisted resources are served with appropriate
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">CORS</a> headers, so they're available via
mechanisms like XHR.
</p>

<p>
A navigation from a web origin to an extension resource will be blocked unless
the resource is listed as web accessible. Note these corner cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>When an extension uses the $(ref:webRequest) or $(ref:declarativeWebRequest)
APIs to redirect a public resource request to a resource that is not web
accessible, such request is also blocked.</li>
<li>The above holds true even if the resource that is not web accessible is
owned by the redirecting extension.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts">Content scripts</a> themselves do not need to be allowlisted.
</p>

<p>
Prior to manifest version 2 all resources within an extension could be accessed
from any page on the web. This allowed a malicious website to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">fingerprint</a> the
extensions that a user has installed or exploit vulnerabilities (for example
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">XSS bugs</a>) within
installed extensions. Limiting availability to only resources which are
explicitly intended to be web accessible serves to both minimize the available
attack surface and protect the privacy of users.
</p>

<h2 id="availability">Default Availability</h2>

<p>
Resources inside of packages using <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest#manifest_version"><code>manifest_version</code></a>
2 or above are <strong>blocked by default</strong>, and must be allowlisted
for use via this property.
</p>

<p>
Resources inside of packages using <code>manifest_version</code> 1 are available
by default, but <em>if</em> you do set this property, then it will be treated as
a complete list of all allowlisted resources. Resources not listed will be
blocked.
