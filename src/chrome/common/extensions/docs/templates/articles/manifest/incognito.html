<h1 id="incognito">Manifest - Incognito</h1>

<p>
Use the <code>"incognito"</code> manifest key with either
<code>"spanning"</code> or <code>"split"</code> to specify how this
{{platform}} will behave if allowed to run in incognito mode. Using <code>
"not_allowed"</code> to prevent this {{platform}} from being enabled in
incognito mode.
</p>

<p>
Only extensions can choose. Apps will always use the default value for the app
type; <code>"spanning"</code> for Chrome apps and <code>"split"</code> for
installable web and legacy packaged apps.
</p>

<h2 id="spanning">Spanning mode</h2>
<p>
The default for extensions and Chrome apps is <code>"spanning"</code>, which
means that it will run in a single shared process. Any events or messages from
an incognito tab will be sent to the shared process, with an <em>incognito</em>
flag indicating where it came from. Because incognito tabs cannot use this
shared process, an extension using the <code>"spanning"</code> incognito mode
will not be able to load pages from its extension package into the main frame
of an incognito tab.
</p>

<h2 id="split">Split mode</h2>
<p>
The default for installable web apps and legacy packaged apps is
<code>"split"</code>, which means that all app pages in an incognito window
will run in their own incognito process.  If the app or extension contains a
background page, that will also run in the incognito process.  This incognito
process runs along side the regular process, but has a separate memory-only
cookie store. Each process sees events and messages only from its own context
(for example, the incognito process will see only incognito tab updates).  The
processes are unable to communicate with each other.
</p>

<h2 id="not_allowed">Not allowed</h2>
<p>
The {{platform}} cannot be enabled in incognito mode. Available from Chrome 47.
</p>

<h2 id="how-to-choose">How to choose</h2>
<p>
As a rule of thumb, if your extension or app needs to load a tab in an
incognito browser, use <em>split</em> incognito behavior. If your extension or
app needs to be logged into a remote server use <em>spanning</em> incognito
behavior.

<p>
<a href="/{{platform}}s/storage#property-sync">chrome.storage.sync</a> and
<a href="/{{platform}}s/storage#property-local">chrome.storage.local</a>
are <em>always</em> shared between regular and incognito processes. It is
recommended to use them for persisting your {{platform}}'s settings.
