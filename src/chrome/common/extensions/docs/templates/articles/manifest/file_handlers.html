<h1 id="file_handlers">Manifest - File Handlers</h1>

<p>
Used by <a href="../app_lifecycle#eventpage">packaged apps</a>
to specify what types of files the app can handle. An app can have multiple
<code>file_handlers</code>, with each one having an identifier, a list of MIME
types and/or a list of file extensions that can be handled.
The app can handle a file if it either has a matching file extension or has a
matching MIME type. The app can also handle directories if
<code>include_directories</code> is set. You can use a wildcard <code>"*"</code>
in <code>types</code> or <code>extensions</code> to indicate that the app can
handle any file type or <code>"<em>type</em>/*"</code> in <code>types</code>
to indicate that the app can handle any file with a MIME type of
<code><em>type</em></code>. Here's an example of specifying file handlers:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"file_handlers": {
  "text": {
    "types": [
      "text/*"
    ],
  },
  "image": {
    "types": [
      "image/png",
      "image/jpeg"
    ],
    "extensions": [
      "tiff"
    ],
  },
  "any": {
    "extensions": [
      "*",
      "include_directories": true
    ],
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
To handle files or directories, apps also need to declare the $(ref:fileSystem)
permission. Apps can then be passed files or directories in the
$(ref:app.runtime.onLaunched) event - either from the system file manager
(currently supported on Chrome OS only) or by providing a path on the
<a href="../first_app#open">command line</a>.
