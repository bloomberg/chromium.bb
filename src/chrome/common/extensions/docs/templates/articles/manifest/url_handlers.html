<h1 id="url_handlers">url_handlers</h1>

<p>
Used by <a href="../app_lifecycle#eventpage">packaged apps</a>
to specify URL patterns the app wants to intercept and handle. An app can
define multiple URL handlers under this manifest entry, each having an identifier,
a URL pattern, and a title.
Here's an example of how to specify <code>url_handlers</code>:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"url_handlers": {
  "view_foo_presentation": {
    "matches": [
      "https://www.foo.com/presentation/view/*"
    ],
    "title": "View Foo presentation"
  },
  "view_bar_presentation": {
    "matches": [
      "https://www.bar.com/view/slideshow/*"
    ],
    "title": "View bar presentation"
  },
  "edit_spreadsheet": {
    "matches": [
      "https://www.foo.com/spreadsheet/edit/*",
      "https://www.bar.com/spreadsheet/edit/*"
    ],
    "title": "Edit spreadsheet"
  }
}</pre>

<p>
Apps can only register to handle URL patterns within domains that they own,
that is, can prove ownership of as determined by the
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a>.
Apps that violate this requirement and attempt to register for handling external
URLs will be rejected by the Chrome Web Store on upload.
</p>
<p>
This automatically means that at least a complete domain should always be
specified for all the patterns under <code>matches</code> (otherwise ownership
cannot be verified).
</p>
<p>
Upon successful registration and installation, an app will be launched for all
matching navigations inside browser tabs as well as other apps. The app will
receive a new kind of the
<a href="../app_runtime#event-onLaunched">app.runtime.onLaunched</a>
event, with the launchData
object containing the matched handler's identifier (such as "view_foo_presentation"
above), the URL being navigated to, and the referrer's URL.
</p>
<p>
The <code>title</code> field is reserved for future use in all relevant UI elements.
It should describe the action that the app performs when launched with this type
of URL handler.
