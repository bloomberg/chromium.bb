<h1>Shared Modules</h1><p>
<em>Shared Modules</em> are permissionless collections of resources
that can be shared between other extensions and apps.  Common
uses of Shared Modules are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    As an API.  You can distribute a Shared Module that can
    provide HTML, JS, and other source to provide an API which
    can be updated independently of the extensions that depend
    on it.  This can be useful for runtimes and game engines,
    where apps are often smaller payloads of data that run on
    the Shared Module's code.
  </li>
  <li>
    As a download optimization.  The Shared Module contains common
    resources used by many extensions.  It's downloaded once,
    the first time a dependent extension is installed.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="manifest"> Manifest </h2>
<p>
Shared Modules are used through two
<a href="manifest">manifest</a> fields: export and import.
</p>

<p>
The <em>export</em> field indicates an extension is
a Shared Module that exports its resources:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "name": "My Shared Module",
  <b>"export": {
    // Optional list of extension IDs explicitly allowed to
    // import this Shared Module's resources.  If no allowlist
    // is given, all extensions are allowed to import it.
    "allowlist": [
      "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb"
    ]
  }</b>
  // Note: no permissions are allowed in Shared Modules
}
</pre>

<p>
The <em>import</em> field is used by extensions and apps
to declare that they depend on the resources from particular
Shared Modules:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "name": "My Importing Extension",
  ...
  <b>"import": [
    {"id": "cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc"},
    {"id": "dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd"
     "minimum_version": "0.5" // optional
    },
  ]</b>
}
</pre>

<h2 id="accessing_resources"> Accessing Resources </h2>

<p>
Shared Module resources are accessed by a reserved path
<em>_modules/&lt;shared_module_id&gt;</em> in the root of
your importing extension. For example, to include the script
'foo.js' from a Shared Module with ID
"cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc", use this path from the
root of your extension:
</p>

<code>
&lt;script src="_modules/cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc/foo.js"&gt;
</code>

<p>
If the importing extension has ID "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
then the full URL to resources in the Shared Module is:
</p>

<code>
chrome-extension://aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa/_modules/cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc/
</code>

<p>
Note that since resources from Shared Modules are overlaid into
the origin of the importing extension, all privileges granted to
the importing extension are available to code in Shared Modules.
Also, the Shared Module is able to access resources in the importing
extension by using absolute paths.
</p>

<h2 id="install_uninstall"> Install / Uninstall </h2>

<p>
A Shared Module is automatically installed from the Chrome Web Store
when needed by a dependent extension, and automatically uninstalled
when the last extension which references it is uninstalled.  In order
to upload an extension which uses a Shared Module, the Shared Module
must be published in the Chrome Web Store and the extension must
not be restricted from using the Shared Module by its allowlist.
</p>

<p>
During development, you will need to manually install any Shared Modules
your extension uses.  Automatic installs do not happen for extensions
that are side-loaded or loaded as unpacked extensions.  For locally
installed, unpacked Shared Modules, you must use the
<a href="manifest/key">key</a> field to ensure the Shared
Modules use the correct IDs.
</p>
