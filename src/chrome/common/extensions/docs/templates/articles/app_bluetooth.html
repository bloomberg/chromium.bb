<h1>Bluetooth</h1>

<p>
  This document describes how to use the <a href="bluetooth.html">Bluetooth</a>,
  <a href="bluetoothSocket.html">Bluetooth Socket</a> and
  <a href="bluetoothLowEnergy.html">Bluetooth Low Energy</a> APIs to
  communicate with Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy devices.
</p>

<p>
  For background information about Bluetooth, see the official
  <a href="http://www.bluetooth.org">Bluetooth specifications</a>.
</p>

<p class="note">
  <b>Note:</b>
    With Chrome 56, users can select nearby Bluetooth Low Energy devices to provide to web sites that use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/07/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web">Web Bluetooth</a> API.
</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest requirements</h2>

<p>
  For Chrome Apps that use Bluetooth, add the
  <a href="manifest/bluetooth">bluetooth</a> entry to the manifest
  and specify, if appropriate, the UUIDs of profiles, protocols or services
  you wish to implement along with whether you wish to implement these with the
  socket and/or Low Energy APIs.
</p>

<p>
  For example for a socket implementation:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"bluetooth": {
  "uuids": [ "1105", "1106" ],
  "socket": true
}
</pre>

<p>
  And for a Low Energy implementation:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"bluetooth": {
  "uuids": [ "180D", "1809", "180F" ],
  "low_energy": true
}
</pre>

<p>
  To only access adapter state, discover nearby devices, and obtain basic
  information about devices, only the entry itself is required:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"bluetooth": { }
</pre>

<h2 id="adapter_info">Adapter information</h2>

<h3 id="adapter_state">Obtaining adapter state</h3>

<p>
  To obtain the state of the Bluetooth adapter, use the
  $(ref:bluetooth.getAdapterState) method:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getAdapterState(function(adapter) {
  console.log("Adapter " + adapter.address + ": " + adapter.name);
});
</pre>

<h3 id="adapter_notifications">Adapter notifications</h3>

<p>
  The $(ref:bluetooth.onAdapterStateChanged) event is sent
  whenever the adapter state changes. This can be used, for example, to
  determine when the adapter radio is powered on or off.
</p>

<pre>
var powered = false;
chrome.bluetooth.getAdapterState(function(adapter) {
  powered = adapter.powered;
});

chrome.bluetooth.onAdapterStateChanged.addListener(
  function(adapter) {
    if (adapter.powered != powered) {
      powered = adapter.powered;
      if (powered) {
        console.log("Adapter radio is on");
      } else {
        console.log("Adapter radio is off");
      }
    }
  });
</pre>

<h2 id="device_info">Device information</h2>

<h3 id="listing_devices">Listing known devices</h3>

<p>
  To get a list of the devices known to the Bluetooth adapter, use the
  $(ref:bluetooth.getDevices) method:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    console.log(devices[i].address);
  }
});
</pre>

<p>
  All devices are returned, including paired devices and devices recently
  discovered. It will not begin discovery of new devices (see
  <a href="#discovery">Discovering nearby devices</a>).
</p>

<h3 id="device_notifications">Receiving device notifications</h3>

<p>
  Instead of repeatedly calling $(ref:bluetooth.getDevices), you
  can use the $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceAdded), $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceChanged)
  and $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceRemoved) events to receive notifications.
</p>

<p>
  The $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceAdded) event is sent whenever a
  device is discovered by the adapter or makes a connection to the adapter:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceAdded.addListener(function(device) {
  console.log(device.address);
});
</pre>

<p>
  Adding a listener for this event does not begin discovery of devices
  (see <a href="#discovery">Discovering nearby devices</a>).
</p>

<p>
  Changes to devices, including previously discovered devices becoming paired,
  are notified by the $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceChanged) event:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceChanged.addListener(function(device) {
  console.log(device.address);
});
</pre>

<p>
  Finally the $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceRemoved) event is sent
  whenever a paired device is removed from the system, or a discovered device
  has not been seen recently:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceRemoved.addListener(function(device) {
  console.log(device.address);
});
</pre>

<h3 id="discovery">Discovering nearby devices</h3>

<p>
  To begin discovery of nearby devices, use the
  $(ref:bluetooth.startDiscovery) method. Discovery can be resource intensive
  so you should call $(ref:bluetooth.stopDiscovery) when done.
</p>

<p>
  You should call $(ref:bluetooth.startDiscovery) whenever your
  app needs to discover nearby devices. Do not make the call conditional on
  the <code>discovering</code> property of $(ref:bluetooth.AdapterState). The
  call will succeed even if another app is discovering nearby devices, and will
  ensure the adapter continues to perform discovery after that other app has
  stopped.
</p>

<p>
  Information about each newly discovered device is received using the
  $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceAdded) event. For devices that have
  already been discovered recently, or have been previously paired with or
  connected to, the event will not be sent. Instead you should call
  $(ref:bluetooth.getDevices) to obtain the current information,
  and use the $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceChanged) event to be notified of changes
  to that information as a result of discovery.
</p>

<p>
  Example:
</p>

<pre>
var device_names = {};
var updateDeviceName = function(device) {
  device_names[device.address] = device.name;
};
var removeDeviceName = function(device) {
  delete device_names[device.address];
}

// Add listeners to receive newly found devices and updates
// to the previously known devices.
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceAdded.addListener(updateDeviceName);
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceChanged.addListener(updateDeviceName);
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceRemoved.addListener(removeDeviceName);

// With the listeners in place, get the list of devices found in
// previous discovery sessions, or any currently active ones,
// along with paired devices.
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    updateDeviceName(devices[i]);
  }
});

// Now begin the discovery process.
chrome.bluetooth.startDiscovery(function() {
  // Stop discovery after 30 seconds.
  setTimeout(function() {
    chrome.bluetooth.stopDiscovery(function() {});
  }, 30000);
});
</pre>

<p>
  If the user turns off the Bluetooth radio, all discovery sessions will be
  ended and not resumed automatically when the radio is switched on. If this
  matters to your app, you should watch the
  $(ref:bluetooth.onAdapterStateChanged) event. If the
  <code>discovering</code> property changes to <code>false</code>, then your app
  will need to call $(ref:bluetooth.startDiscovery) again to
  resume. Be cautious of the resource intensive nature of discovery.
</p>

<h3 id="identifying_devices">Identifying devices</h3>

<p>
  A number of different options are provided for identifying devices returned
  by $(ref:bluetooth.getDevices) and the related events.
</p>

<p>
  If the device supports the Bluetooth
  <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/DI.aspx">Device ID specification</a>,
  several properties are added to the Device object containing the fields
  defined by that specification. Example:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    if (devices[0].vendorIdSource != undefined) {
      console.log(devices[0].address + ' = ' +
                  devices[0].vendorIdSource + ':' +
                  devices[0].vendorId.toString(16) + ':' +
                  devices[0].productId.toString(16) + ':' +
                  devices[0].deviceId.toString(16));
    }
  }
});
</pre>

<p>
  The Device ID specification is usually sufficient to identify a particular
  model, and even revision, of a device from a vendor. Where it is not present,
  you must instead rely on information about the class or type of the device,
  optionally combined with the manufacturer prefix in the <code>address</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Most Bluetooth devices provide Class of Device information as a bit-field
  interpreted according to the
  <a href="https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/assigned-numbers/baseband">Baseband Assigned Numbers</a>
  document. This bit-field is available in the <code>deviceClass</code>
  property.
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    if (devices[0].vendorIdSource != undefined) {
      console.log(devices[0].address + ' = ' +
                  devices[0].deviceClass.toString(16));
    }
  }
});
</pre>

<p>
  Parsing the field can be complex so for the most common device types Chrome
  handles this for you and sets the <code>type</code> field. Where this is
  not available, or insufficient for your needs, you'll need to parse the
  <code>deviceClass</code> yourself.
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    if (devices[0].vendorIdSource != undefined) {
      console.log(devices[0].address + ' = ' + devices[0].type);
    }
  }
});
</pre>

<h2 id="using_rfcomm">Using RFCOMM and L2CAP</h2>

<p>
  Chrome Apps may make connections to any device that supports RFCOMM or
  L2CAP services. This includes the majority of classic Bluetooth devices on
  the market.
</p>

<h3 id="connecting">Connecting to a socket</h3>

<p>
  In order to make a connection to a device you need three things. A socket
  to make the connection with, created using $(ref:bluetoothSocket.create);
  the address of the device you wish to connect to, and the UUID of the
  service itself.
</p>

<p>
  Before making the connection you should verify that the adapter is aware of
  the device by using $(ref:bluetooth.getDevice) or the device
  discovery APIs.
</p>

<p>
  The information necessary to establish the underlying connection, including
  whether the RFCOMM or L2CAP protocol should be used and which channel or PSM,
  is obtained using SDP discovery on the device.
</p>

<p>
  Example:
</p>

<pre>
var uuid = '1105';
var onConnectedCallback = function() {
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
    console.log("Connection failed: " + chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
  } else {
    // Profile implementation here.
  }
};

chrome.bluetoothSocket.create(function(createInfo) {
  chrome.bluetoothSocket.connect(createInfo.socketId,
    device.address, uuid, onConnectedCallback);
});
</pre>

<p>
  Keep a handle to the socketId so that you can later send data
  ($(ref:bluetoothSocket.send)) to this socket.
</p>

<h3 id="receiving">Receiving from and sending to a socket</h3>

<p>
  Receiving data from and sending to a socket uses <code>ArrayBuffer</code>
  objects. To learn about ArrayBuffers, check out the overview,
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript_typed_arrays">JavaScript typed arrays</a>,
  and the tutorial,
  <a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/06/How-to-convert-ArrayBuffer-to-and-from-String">How to convert ArrayBuffer to and from String</a>.
</p>

<p>
  To send data you have in <code>arrayBuffer</code> use
  $(ref:bluetoothSocket.send):
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothSocket.send(socketId, arrayBuffer, function(bytes_sent) {
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
    console.log("Send failed: " + chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
  } else {
    console.log("Sent " + bytes_sent + " bytes")
  }
})
</pre>

<p>
  In contrast to the method to send data, data is received in an event
  ($(ref:bluetoothSocket.onReceive). Sockets are created unpaused (see
  $(ref:bluetoothSocket.setPaused)) so the listener for this event is
  typically added between $(ref:bluetoothSocket.create) and
  $(ref:bluetoothSocket.connect).
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothSocket.onRecieve.addListener(function(receiveInfo) {
  if (receiveInfo.socketId != socketId)
    return;
  // receiveInfo.data is an ArrayBuffer.
});
</pre>

<h3 id="errors">Receiving socket errors and disconnection</h3>

<p>
  To be notified of socket errors, including disconnection, add a listener to
  the $(ref:bluetoothSocket.onReceiveError) event.
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothSocket.onReceiveError.addListener(function(errorInfo) {
  // Cause is in errorInfo.error.
  console.log(errorInfo.errorMessage);
});
</pre>

<h3 id="disconnection">Disconnecting from a socket</h3>

<p>
  To hang up the connection and disconnect the socket use
  $(ref:bluetoothSocket.disconnect).
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothSocket.disconnect(socketId);
</pre>

<h2 id="using_rfcomm">Publishing services</h2>

<p>
  In addition to making outbound connections to devices, Chrome Apps may
  publish services that may be used by any device that supports RFCOMM or
  L2CAP.
</p>

<h3 id="listening">Listening on a socket</h3>

<p>
  Two types of published service are supported. RFCOMM is the most commonly
  used and covers the majority of devices and profiles:
</p>

<pre>
var uuid = '1105';
chrome.bluetoothSocket.create(function(createInfo) {
  chrome.bluetoothSocket.listenUsingRfcomm(createInfo.socketId,
    uuid, onListenCallback);
});
</pre>

<p>
  L2CAP is the other and covers other device types and vendor-specific uses
  such as firmware uploading.
</p>

<pre>
var uuid = '0b87367c-f188-47cd-bc20-a5f4f70973c6';
chrome.bluetoothSocket.create(function(createInfo) {
  chrome.bluetoothSocket.listenUsingL2cap(createInfo.socketId,
    uuid, onListenCallback);
});
</pre>

<p>
  In both cases an optional $(ref:bluetoothSocket.ListenOptions) may be
  passed to allocate a specific channel or PSM. The callback indicates error
  through <code>chrome.runtime.lastError</code> and success otherwise.
  Keep a handle to the socketId so that you can later accept connections
  ($(ref:bluetoothSocket.onAccept)) from this socket.
</p>

<h3 id="accepting">Accepting client connections</h3>

<p>
  Client connections are accepted and passed to your application through the
  $(ref:bluetoothSocket.onAccept) event.
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothSocket.onAccept.addListener(function(acceptInfo) {
  if (info.socketId != serverSocketId)
    return;

  // Say hello...
  chrome.bluetoothSocket.send(acceptInfo.clientSocketId,
    data, onSendCallback);

  // Accepted sockets are initially paused,
  // set the onReceive listener first.
  chrome.bluetoothSocket.onReceive.addListener(onReceive);
  chrome.bluetoothSocket.setPaused(false);
});
</pre>

<h3 id="stop-accepting">Stop accepting client connections</h3>

<p>
  To stop accepting client connections and unpublish the service use
  $(ref:bluetoothSocket.disconnect).
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothSocket.disconnect(serverSocketId);
</pre>

<h2 id="low-energy">Interacting with Low Energy devices</h2>

<p>
  Bluetooth Low Energy or (Bluetooth Smart) is a wireless technology aimed at
  reduced power consumption. The
  <a href="bluetoothLowEnergy.html">Bluetooth Low Energy</a> API allows
  applications to implement the central role in a LE connection to a
  peripheral. The following sections describe how to discover,
  connect to, and interact with Bluetooth Low Energy peripherals.
</p>

<h3 id="le-discovery">Discovering and connecting to peripherals</h3>

<p>
  As with traditional Bluetooth devices, LE peripherals can be discovered
  using the methods described in <a href="#discovery">Discovering nearby devices
  </a>. An LE device makes itself discoverable by sending data packets called
  "Advertising Data" and the device is said to be in <em>advertising mode</em>.
  The advertising data may contain UUIDs of services that are available on the
  device. If present, these UUIDs will be accessible using the
  <code>uuids</code> property of the corresponding $(ref:bluetooth.Device)
  object.
</p>

<p>
  Once discovered, an LE device can be connected to by calling
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.connect) so that the application can interact with
  its services:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceAdded.addListener(function(device) {
  var uuid = '0000180d-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb';
  if (!device.uuids || device.uuids.indexOf(uuid) < 0)
    return;

  // The device has a service with the desired UUID.
  chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.connect(device.address, function () {
    if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
      console.log('Failed to connect: ' + chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
      return;
    }

    // Connected! Do stuff...
    ...
  });
});
</pre>

<p>
  Once connected, the <code>connected</code> property of the corresponding
  $(ref:bluetooth.Device) object will have the value <code>true</code>. Calling
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.connect) establishes a claim by the application on
  the physical connection to the device. A physical connection to the device
  can exist without ever calling $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.connect) (for example
  due to another application). In this case, while your application can still
  interact with the services of the device, it should always call
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.connect) to prevent another application from
  disconnecting the physical link.
</p>

<p>
  Once your application no longer needs to be connected, it can remove its
  claim on the connection by calling $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.disconnect):
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.disconnect(deviceAddress);
</pre>

<p>
  Note that this won't necessarily destroy the physical link to the device, as
  there may be other applications who have active connections to the device.
  Sometimes the device might become disconnected due to reasons that are beyond
  the control of the application (e.g. if the device disappears or gets
  explicitly disconnected by the user through utilities of the operating
  system). Your application should observe the $(ref:bluetooth.onDeviceChanged)
  event to get notified of changes to the connection and reconnect if necessary.
</p>

<p>
  Once connected, the device that is running Chrome will be in the
  so called <em>central role</em>, while the remote device is said to be in the
  <em>peripheral role</em>. At this point, your application can interact with
  the services on the device using the methods described in the following
  section. <em>Note:</em> The APIs currently do not support acting as a LE
  peripheral; apps can only implement the central role.
</p>

<h3 id="gatt">Services, Characteristics, and Descriptors</h3>

<p>
Bluetooth Low Energy is based on a simple request-response protocol called the
<em>Attribute Protocol</em> (ATT). Using ATT, a central device interacts with
the so called <em>attributes</em> on a peripheral device by conforming to a
special Bluetooth profile called the <em>Generic Attribute Profile</em> (GATT).
GATT defines the following high level concepts:
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Service:</span> A GATT service
    represents a collection of data and associated behaviors to accomplish a
    particular function of a device. For example, a heart rate monitor will
    typically have at least one "Heart Rate Service". Information about a
    GATT service is contained in a $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.Service) object.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Characteristic:</span> A GATT
    characteristic is a basic data element used to construct a GATT service,
    containing a value along with properties that define how that value can
    be accessed. For example, the "Heart Rate Service" has the "Heart Rate
    Measurement" characteristic, which is used to obtain the value of the
    user's heart rate. Information about a GATT characteristic is contained
    in a $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.Characteristic) object.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Descriptor:</span> A GATT characteristic
    descriptor contains further information about a characteristic. Information
    about a GATT characteristic descriptor is contained in a
    $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.Descriptor) object.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The <a href="bluetoothLowEnergy.html">Bluetooth Low Energy</a> API allows
  applications to find information about a device's services, characteristics,
  and descriptors by calling $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.getServices),
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.getCharacteristics), and
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.getDescriptors). Apps can filter through services,
  characteristics, and descriptors by comparing their <code>uuid</code> field
  to the desired GATT UUID:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.getServices(deviceAddress, function(services) {
  ...
  for (var i = 0; i < services.length; i++) {
    if (services[i].uuid == HEART_RATE_SERVICE_UUID) {
      heartRateService = services[i];
      break;
    }
  }
  ...
});
</pre>

<p>
  Each service, characteristic, and descriptor accessible through the API is
  assigned a unique instance identifier, which can be obtained using the
  <code>instanceId</code> field. This instance ID can be used to identify a
  GATT object and to perform specific operations on it:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.getCharacteristics(heartRateService.instanceId,
                                             function(chracteristics) {
  ...
  for (var i = 0; i < characteristics.length; i++) {
    if (characteristics[i].uuid == HEART_RATE_MEASUREMENT_UUID) {
      measurementChar = characteristics[i];
      break;
    }
  }
  ...
  chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.getDescriptors(measurementChar.instanceId,
                                           function(descriptors) {
    ...
  });
});
</pre>

<h3 id="service-events">Service events</h3>

<p>
  Once a device is connected, Chrome will discover its services. As each service
  is discovered and removed, the application will receive the
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.onServiceAdded) and
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.onServiceRemoved) events:
</p>

<pre>
  var initializeService = function(service) {
    if (!service) {
      console.log('No service selected!');
      // Reset UI, etc.
      ...
      return;
    }

    myService = service;

    // Get all the characteristics and descriptors and bootstrap the app.
    ...
  };

  chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.onServiceAdded.addListener(function(service) {
    if (service.uuid == MY_SERVICE_UUID)
      initializeService(service);
  });

  chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.onServiceRemoved.addListener(function(service) {
    if (service.instanceId == myService.instanceId)
      initializeService(null);
  });
</pre>

<p>
  Chrome discovers all characteristics and descriptors of a service
  asynchronously and sends the $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.onServiceAdded) event
  once discovery has completed. If the connection to a peripheral terminates,
  Chrome removes all related services and sends the
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.onServiceRemoved) event.
</p>

<p>
  Some peripherals may modify their services, e.g. the characteristics of a
  service may change or services may get added and removed entirely. Chrome
  notifies apps of these changes using the
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.onServiceChanged),
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.onServiceAdded), and
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.onServiceRemoved) events.
</p>

<pre>
  chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.onServiceChanged.addListener(function(service) {
    if (service.instanceId != myService.instanceId)
      return;

    updateMyService(service);
  });
</pre>

<h3 id="gatt-read-write">Reading and writing a characteristic's value</h3>

<p>
  A GATT characteristic encodes one aspect of its service. A central app reads,
  acts on, and modifies the state of a peripheral's service by operating on a
  characteristic's value. The characteristic value is a sequence of bytes and
  its meaning is defined by the high-level specification that defines a certain
  characteristic. For example, the value of the <em>Heart Rate Measurement</em>
  characteristic encodes the user's heart rate and the total amount of calories
  they burned, while the <em>Body Sensor Location</em> characteristic encodes
  where in the body the heart rate sensor should be worn.
</p>

<p>
  Chrome provides the $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.readCharacteristicValue) method
  to read the value of a characteristic:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.readCharacteristicValue(chrc.instanceId,
                                                  function(result) {
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
    console.log('Failed to read value: ' + chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
    return;
  }

  var bytes = new Uint8Array(result.value);

  // Do stuff with the bytes.
  ...
});
</pre>

<p>
  Some characteristics are writable, especially those that behave as "Control
  Points", where writing the value has side effects. For example, the <em>Heart
  Rate Control Point</em> characteristic is used to tell a heart rate sensor to
  reset its count of total calories burned and only supports writes. To achieve
  this, Chrome provides the $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.writeCharacteristicValue)
  method:
</p>

<pre>
var myBytes = new Uint8Array([ ... ]);
chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.writeCharacteristicValue(chrc.instanceId,
                                                   myBytes.buffer,
                                                   function() {
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
    console.log('Failed to write value: ' +
                chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
    return;
  }

  // Value is written now.
});
</pre>

<p>
  Characteristic descriptors behave the same way and can be readable and/or
  writable. Chrome provides the $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.readDescriptorValue)
  and $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.writeDescriptorValue) methods to read and write
  the value of a descriptor.

<p>
  To check if a characteristic supports reads or writes, an application can
  check the <code>properties</code> field of a
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.Characteristic) object. While this field does not
  contain information about the security requirements to access a value, it does
  describe which value operation the characteristic supports in general.
</p>

<h3 id="gatt-notifications">Handling value notifications</h3>

<p>
  Some characteristics make their value known using notifications or
  indications. For example the <em>Heart Rate Measurement</em> characteristic is
  neither readable nor writable but sends updates on its current value at
  regular intervals. Applications can listen to these notifications using the
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.onCharacteristicValueChanged) event.
</p>

<pre>
  chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.onCharacteristicValueChanged.addListener(
      function(chrc) {
    if (chrc.instanceId != myCharId)
      return;

    var bytes = new Uint8Array(chrc.value);

    // Do stuff with the bytes.
    ...
  });
</pre>

<p>
  Even if a characteristic supports notifications/indications, they aren't
  enabled by default. An application should call the
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.startCharacteristicNotifications) and
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.stopCharacteristicNotifications) methods to start or
  stop receiving the $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.onCharacteristicValueChanged)
  event.
</p>

<pre>
  // Start receiving characteristic value notifications.
  var notifying = false;
  chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.startCharacteristicNotifications(chrc.instanceId,
                                                             function() {
    if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
      console.log('Failed to enable notifications: ' +
                  chrome.runtime.lastError.message);
      return;
    }

    notifying = true;
  });

  ...

  // No longer interested in notifications from this characteristic.
  if (notifying) {
    chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.stopCharacteristicNotifications(
        chrc.instanceId);
  }
</pre>

<p>
  Once notifications are started, the application will receive the
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.onCharacteristicValueChanged) every time a
  notification or indication is received from the characteristic. If the
  characteristic supports reads, then this event will also be sent after a
  successful call to $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.readCharacteristicValue). This
  allows apps to unify the control flow of a value update triggered through a
  read request and notifications:
</p>

<pre>
  chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.onCharacteristicValueChanged.addListener(
      function(chrc) {
    // Process the value.
    ...
  });

  chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.startCharacteristicNotifications(chrc.instanceId,
                                                             function() {
    // Notifications started. Read the initial value.
    chrome.bluetoothLowEnergy.readCharacteristicValue(chrc.instanceId,
                                                      function(result) {
      ...
      // No need to do anything here since onCharacteristicValueChanged
      // will handle it.
    });
  });
</pre>

<p>
  If a characteristic supports notifications, its <code>properties</code> field
  will contain either the <code>"notify"</code> or <code>"indicate"</code>
  property.
</p>

<p>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> If a characteristic supports
  notifications/indications, it will have the "Client Characteristic
  Configuration" descriptor to enable/disable notifications. Chrome does not
  permit apps to write to this descriptor. Apps should instead use the
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.startCharacteristicNotifications) and
  $(ref:bluetoothLowEnergy.stopCharacteristicNotifications) methods to control
  notification behavior.
