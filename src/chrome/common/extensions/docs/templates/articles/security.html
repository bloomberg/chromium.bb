<h1>Stay Secure</h1>
<p>

  Extensions have access to special privileges within the browser,
  making them an appealing target for attackers.
  If an extension is compromised,
  <i>every</i> user of that extension becomes vulnerable to malicious
  and unwanted intrusion.
  Keep an extension secure and its users protected by incorporating these
  practices.
</p>
<h2 id="PDA">Protect Developer Accounts</h2>
<p>
  Extension code is uploaded and updated through Google accounts.
  If developers' accounts are compromised,
  an attacker could push malicious code directly to all users.
  Protect these accounts by creating specifically developer accounts
  and enabling
  <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en">
    two-factor authentication
  </a>, preferably with a
  <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6103523">
   security key
  </a>.
</p>
<h3 id="group_publishing">Keep Groups Selective</h3>
<p>
  If using <a href="/publish#set-up-group-publishing">group publishing</a>,
  keep the group confined to trusted developers.
  Do not accept membership requests from unknown persons.
</p>
<h2 id="https">Never use HTTP, Ever</h2>
<p>
  When requesting or sending data, avoid an HTTP connection.
  Assume that any HTTP connections will have eavesdroppers
  or contain modifications.
  HTTPS should always be prefered, as it has built-in security
  circumventing most
  <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Man-in-the-middle_attack">
    man-in-the-middle attacks</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="permissions">Request Minimal Permissions</h2>
<p>
  The Chrome browser limits an extension's access to privileges
  that have been explicitly requested in the <a href="/manifest">manifest</a>.
  Extensions should minimize their permissions
  by only registering APIs and websites they depend on.
  Arbitrary code should be kept to a minimum.
</p>
<p>
  Limiting an extensions privileges limits what a potential attacker can exploit.
</p>
<h3 id="xhr">Cross-Origin XMLHttpRequest</h3>
<p>
  An extension can only use <a href="/xhr">XMLHttpRequest</a>
  to get resources from itself and
  from domains specified in the permissions.
</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  {
    "name": "Very Secure Extension",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "Example of a Secure Extension",
    <b>"permissions": [
      "https://developer.chrome.com/*",
      "https://*.google.com/"
    ],</b>
    "manifest_version": 2
  }
</pre>
<p>
  This extension requests access to anything on developer.chrome.com and
  subdomains of Google by listing <code>"https://developer.chrome.com/*"</code>
  and <code>"https://*google.com/"</code> in the permissions.
  If the extension were compromised,
  it would still only have permission to interact with
  websites that meet the <a href="/match_patterns">match pattern</a>.
  The attacker would not be able to access
  <code>"https://user_bank_info.com"</code> or
  interact with <code>"https://malicious_website.com"</code>.
</p>
<h2 id="manifest_fields">Limit Manifest Fields</h2>
<p>
  Including unnecessary registrations in the manifest creates vulnerabilities
  and makes an extension more visible.
  Limit manifest fields to those the extension relies on
  and give specific field registration.
</p>
<h3 id="externally_connectable">Externally Connectable</h3>
<p>
  Use the <a href="/manifest/externally_connectable">
    <code>externally_connectable</code></a>
  field to declare which external extensions and web pages
  the extension will exchange information with.
  Restrict who the extension can externally connect with to trusted sources.
</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  {
    "name": "Super Safe Extension",
    "externally_connectable": {
      "ids": [
        "iamafriendlyextensionhereisdatas"
      ],
      "matches": [
        "https://developer.chrome.com/*",
        "https://*google.com/"
      ],
      "accepts_tls_channel_id": false
    },
    ...
  }
</pre>
<h3 id="web_accessible_resources">Web Accessible Resources</h3>
<p>
  Making resources accessible by the web, under the
  <a href="/manifest/web_accessible_resources">
    <code>web_accessible_resources</code></a>
  will make an extension detectable by websites and attackers.


</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  {
  ...
  "web_accessible_resources": [
    "images/*.png",
    "style/secure_extension.css",
    "script/secure_extension.js"
  ],
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>
  The more web accessible resources available,
  the more avenues a potential attacker can exploit.
  Keep these files to a minimum.
</p>
<h2 id="content_security_policy">
  Include an Explicit Content Security Policy
</h2>
<p>
  Include a <a href="/contentSecurityPolicy">content security policy</a>
  for the extension in the manifest to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
  If the extension only loads resources from itself register the following:
</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  {
    "name": "Very Secure Extension",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "Example of a Secure Extension",
    <b>"content_security_policy": "default-src 'self'"</b>
    "manifest_version": 2
  }
</pre>
<p>
	If the extension needs to include scripts from specific hosts,
  they can be included:
</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  {
    "name": "Very Secure Extension",
    "version": "1.0",
    "description": "Example of a Secure Extension",
    "content_security_policy": "default-src 'self' <b>https://extension.resource.com</b>"
    "manifest_version": 2
  }
</pre>
<h2 id="avoid">Avoid Executable APIs</h2>
<p>
  APIs that execute code should be replaced with safer alternatives.
</p>
<h3 id="document_write">document.write() and innerHTML</h3>
<p>
  While it may be simpler to dynamically create HTML elements with
  <code>document.write()</code> and <code>innerHTML</code>,
  it leaves the extension, and web pages the extension depends on,
  open to attackers inserting malicious scripts.
  Instead, manually create DOM nodes
  and use <code>innerText</code> to insert dynamic content.
</p>
<pre data-filename="background.js">
  function constructDOM() {
    let newTitle = document.createElement('h1');
    newTitle.innerText = host;
    document.appendChild(newTitle);
  }
</pre>
<h3 id="eval">eval()</h3>
<p>
  Avoid using <code>eval()</code> whenever possible to prevent attacks,
  as <code>eval()</code> will execute any code passed into it,
  which may be malicious.
</p>
<pre data-filename="background.js">
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open("GET", "https://api.example.com/data.json", true);
  xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState == 4) {
      // WARNING! Might be evaluating an evil script!
      var resp = eval("(" + xhr.responseText + ")");
      ...
    }
  }
  xhr.send();
</pre>
<p>
  Instead, prefer safer, and faster, methods such as
  <code>JSON.parse()</code>
</p>
<pre data-filename="background.js">
  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open("GET", "https://api.example.com/data.json", true);
  xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState == 4) {
      // JSON.parse does not evaluate the attacker's scripts.
      var resp = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
    }
  }
  xhr.send();
</pre>
<h2 id="content_scripts">Use Content Scripts Carefully</h2>
<p>
  While <a href="/content_scripts">content scripts</a> live in an
  <a href="/content_scripts#isolated_world">isolated world</a>,
  they are not immune from attacks:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Content scripts are the only part of an extension that interacts
      directly with the web page.  Because of this, hostile web pages may
      manipulate parts of the DOM the content script depends on, or exploit
      surprising web standard behavior, such as
      <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-window-nameditem">named items</a>.
    </li><li>
      To interact with DOM of web pages, content scripts need to execute in
      the same renderer process as the web page.  This makes content scripts
      vulnerable to leaking data via side channel attacks (e.g.,
      <a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a>),
      and to being taken over by an attacker if a malicious web page
      compromises the renderer process.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p><p>
  Sensitive work should be performed in a dedicated process,
  such as the extension's <a href="/background_pages">background script</a>.
  Avoid accidentally exposing extension privileges to content scripts:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Assume that
      <a href="/messaging#content-scripts-are-less-trustworthy"
        >messages from a content script</a>
      might have been crafted by an attacker (e.g.
      <a href="#sanitize">validate and sanitize</a>
      all input and protect your scripts from
      <a href="/messaging#cross-site-scripting">cross-site scripting</a>).
    </li><li>
      Assume any data sent to the content script might leak to the web page.
      Do not send sensitive data (e.g. secrets from the extension, data from
      other web origins, browsing history) to content scripts.
    </li><li>
      Limit the scope of privileged actions that can be triggered
      by content scripts.  Do not allow content scripts to
      <a href="/xhr#xhr-vs-content-scripts"
           >trigger requests to arbitrary URLs</a>
      or pass arbitrary arguments to extension APIs (e.g., do not
      allow passing arbitrary URLs to
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API"
        ><code>fetch</code></a> or
      <a href="/tabs#method-create"><code>chrome.tabs.create</code></a> API).
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2 id="sanitize">Register and Sanitize Inputs</h2>
<p>
  Safeguard an extension from malicious scripts by
  limiting listeners to only what the extension is expecting,
  validating the senders of incoming data,
  and sanitizing all inputs.
</p>
<p>
  An extension should only register for
  <a href="/runtime#event-onMessageExternal"><code>
    runtime.onRequestExternal</code></a>,
  if it is expecting communication from an external website or extension.
  Always validate that the sender matches a trusted source.
</p>
<pre data-filename="background.js">
  // The ID of an external extension
  const kFriendlyExtensionId = "iamafriendlyextensionhereisdatas";

  chrome.runtime.onMessageExternal.addListener(
    function(request, sender, sendResponse) {
      if (sender.id === kFriendlyExtensionId)
        doSomething();
  });
</pre>
<p>
  Even messages via <a href="/runtime#event-onMessage">runtime.onMessage</a>
  event from the extension itself should be scrutinized to ensure
  the <a href="/runtime#type-MessageSender">MessageSender</a>
  is not from a compromised <a href="/content_scripts">content script</a>.
</p>
<pre data-filename="background.js">
  chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(request, sender, sendResponse) {
    if (request.allowedAction)
      console.log("This is an allowed action.");
  });
</pre>
<p>
  Prevent an extension from executing an attacker's script by
  sanitizing user inputs and incoming data,
  even from the extension itself and approved sources.
  <a href="/security#avoid">Avoid executable APIs</a>.
</p>
<pre>
  function sanitizeInput(input) {
      return input.replace(/&/g, '&ampamp;').replace(/&lt;/g, '&amplt;').replace(/"/g, '&ampquot;');
  }
</pre>
