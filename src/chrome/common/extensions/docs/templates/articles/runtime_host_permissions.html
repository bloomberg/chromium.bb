<h1>User Controls For Host Permissions: Transition Guide</h1>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<h3 id="changes">What's changing?</h3>
<p>
  Beginning in Chrome 70, users have the ability to restrict extension host
  access to a custom list of sites, or to configure extensions to require a
  click to gain access to the current page.
</p>

<h3 id="affected-apis">Which APIs are affected?</h3>
<p>
  This change affects any APIs that are affected by the host permissions
  specified in your extension's manifest, as well as content scripts.  APIs
  that require host permissions include
  <a href="/webRequest">webRequest</a>,
  <a href="/cookies">cookies</a>,
  <a href="/tabs#method-executeScript">tabs.executeScript()</a> and
  <a href="/tabs#method-insertCSS">tabs.insertCSS()</a>, and performing
  cross-origin requests, such as through an <code>XMLHTTPRequest</code> or the
  <code>fetch()</code> API.
</p>

<h2 id="restricting-access">Restricting Access</h2>

<h3 id="user-restricting-access">How can the user restrict access?</h3>
<p>
  Users can choose to allow your extension to run on click, on a specific set of
  sites, or on all requested sites.  These options are presented to users on the
  <code>chrome://extensions</code> page as well as in the extension context
  menu.

<h3 id="access-on-click">
  What happens if a user chooses to run my extension "on click"?
</h3>
<p>
  The extension essentially behaves as though it used the
  <a href="/activeTab">activeTab</a> permission. The extension is granted
  temporary access to any host the user clicks the extension on, if that host
  was requested by the extension (and isn't a restricted site, like
  chrome://settings).  When set to run on click, Chrome badges your extension
  with a circle and drop shadow (see below) to indicate that is requesting
  access on a particular site.
</p>

<h3 id="access-on-specific-sites">
  What happens if a user chooses to run my extension on specific sites?
</h3>
<p>
  Your extension is allowed to run automatically on any sites the user has
  chosen, and can access the site without further user action.  On other sites
  that your extension requested, but the user did not grant permission to, the
  behavior is the same as if the user had set the extension to run on click.
</p>

<h3 id="access-on-all-sites">
  What happens if a user chooses to run my extension on all sites?
</h3>
<p>
  The extension can automatically access any sites requested in the manifest.
</p>

<h2 id="api-behaviors">API Behaviors</h2>

<h3 id="web-request-behavior">Web Request API</h3>
<p>
  The extension can still intercept, modify, and block any requests from sites
  it has access to.  For sites the extension does not have access to, Chrome
  badges the extension to indicate that the extension requests access to the
  page.  The user can then grant access to the extension; Chrome then prompts
  the user to refresh the page to allow your extension to intercept the network
  requests.
</p>

<h3 id="scripts-behavior">
  Content Scripts, tabs.executeScript(), tabs.insertCSS()
</h3>
<p>
  The extension can still inject scripts and style sheets automatically for any
  sites it has access to. For sites the extension does not have access to,
  Chrome badges the extension to indicate that the extension requests access to
  the page.  The user can then grant access to the extension.  If the content
  script was set to inject at document_idle, the script will inject immediately.
  Otherwise, Chrome prompts the user to refresh the page to allow your extension
  to inject scripts earlier in page load (at document_start or document_end).
  The callbacks for the
  <a href="/tabs#method-executeScript">tabs.executeScript()</a> and
  <a href="/tabs#method-insertCSS">tabs.insertCSS()</a> methods are only invoked
  if the user grants access to the site.
</p>

<h3 id="background-behavior">Cookies and Background Page XHR</h3>
<p>
  The extension can still read and modify any cookies from and perform a
  cross-origin XHR to sites it has access to.  Because there is no tab
  associated with an extension page accessing another origin's cookies or
  XHRing to another host, Chrome does not badge the extension to indicate to the
  user that the extension is requesting to access a site.  Trying to access a
  cookie for another site or make a cross-origin XHR will fail with an error as
  if the extension's manifest did not include the host permission.  For these
  cases, we encourage you to use optional permissions in order to allow the user
  to grant runtime access to different sites.
</p>

<p>The example below illustrates how this may work for the cookies API.</p>

<p>Before:</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  {
    ...
    "permissions": ["cookies", "https://example.com"]
  }
</pre>

<pre data-filename="background.js">
  chrome.cookies.get({url: 'https://example.com', name: 'mycookie'},
                     function(cookie) {
                       // Use the cookie.
                     });
</pre>

<p>After:</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
  {
    ...
    "permissions": ["cookies"],
    "optional_permissions": ["https://example.com"]
  }
</pre>

<pre data-filename="background.js">
  // Note: permissions.request() requires a user gesture, so this
  // may only be done in response to a user action.
  chrome.permissions.request(
      {origins: ['https://example.com']},
      function(granted) {
        if (granted) {
          chrome.cookies.get({url: 'https://example.com', name: 'mycookie'},
                             function(cookie) {
                               // Use the cookie.
                             });
        } else {
          // Handle grant failure
        }
      });
</pre>

<h2 id="migration">Migration</h2>

<h3 id="best-practices">
  What are best practices to avoid being negatively impacted?
</h3>
<p>
  Extensions can use the <a href="/permissions">optional permissions</a>,
  <a href="/activeTab">activeTab</a>, and
  <a href="/declarativeContent">declarativeContent</a> APIs to follow best
  practices.  Optional permissions are granted at runtime, and allow the
  extension to request specific access to a site.  The
  <a href="/activeTab">activeTab</a> permission is not affected, and extensions
  using it continue to work normally. The
  <a href="/declarativeContent">declarativeContent</a> API is a substitute for
  many needs to inject scripts into every page.
</p>

<h3 id="current-settings">What happens to my current users' settings?</h3>
<p>
  This change will not immediately affect any current permissions granted to
  your extension.  That is, it will continue to operate as before unless the
  user takes action to restrict the sites it is allowed to access.  In future
  releases, Chrome will provide more controls to users to adjust settings.
</p>

<h3 id="checking-access">
  How can I check if my extension has permission to run on a site?
</h3>
<p>
  You can use the
  <a href="/permissions/#method-contains">permissions.contains()</a> API in
  order to check whether your extension has been granted access to a given
  origin.
</p>
