<h2 id="about-web-store">Learn about Chrome Web Store benefits</h2>

<p>For those not familiar with the store, it provides several benefits to users and developers.</p>

<p>For users:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added security &mdash; all apps and extensions are checked for Malware signals.</li>
  <li>All apps are maintained with the latest version the developer has published.</li>
  <li>Ratings and reviews provide a great way to see the quality of applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>For developers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can upload your app once and know that it will be distributed to all users.</li>
  <li>Payments and subscriptions are built in.</li>
  <li>Your app is more discoverable to users.</li>
  <li>Tools to help you manage bugs and reviews from users.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="developer-dashboard">Upload your app via the Developer Dashboard</h2>

<p>The Chrome Web Store has a special dashboard for developers that lets you upload new applications and update existing ones.</p>

<p>The process of uploading apps is simple:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Compress your application's root directory (the folder containing the <em>manifest.json</em> file) into a .zip file.</li>
  <li>Go to the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/dashboard">Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard</a> and log in with a developer-verified Google Account. (If you don't have a verified account, you can <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/developer/about_signup">sign up</a> for a nominal fee.)</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Add new item</strong>.</li>
  <li>Accept the terms and services agreement to continue.</li>
  <li>Use the <strong>choose file</strong> dialog box to find the .zip file in your system. Select that file to upload.</li>
</ol>

<p>The below fields are mandatory:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>detailed description</strong> of your application. Write your description to entice users to download your app.</li>
  <li>A 128x128 <strong>icon</strong> to display in the store. You may re-use your app icon here.</li>
  <li>At least one 1280x800 or 640x400 <strong>screenshot</strong> or YouTube <strong>video</strong> to show off what your app does.</li>
  <li>A 440x280 <strong>small tile icon</strong> that will be displayed on the Chrome Web Store wall.</li>
  <li>The <strong>primary category</strong> where your app should be listed.</li>
  <li>Your app's <strong>language</strong> to help users find it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you are happy with everything, you can now publish your application to the public.</p>
