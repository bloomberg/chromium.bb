<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>
<p>You must declare the "fileSystemProvider" permission and section
in the <a href="manifest">extension manifest</a>
to use the File System Provider API.
For example:</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "My {{platform}}",
  ...
  "permissions": [
    "fileSystemProvider"
  ],
  ...
  "file_system_provider_capabilities": {
    "configurable": true,
    "watchable": false,
    "multiple_mounts": true,
    <span id="manifest-source">"source": "network"</span>
  },
  ...
}
</pre>

<p class="api_reference">
The <code>file_system_provider</code> section must be declared as follows:
{{+partials.manifest_type
   type:apis.extensions.manifestTypes.byName.FileSystemProviderCapabilities /}}
</p>
<p>
Files app uses above information in order to render related UI elements
approprietly. For example, if <code>configurable</code> is set to
</code>true</code>, then a menu item for configuring volumes will be rendered.
Similarly, if <code>multiple_mounts</code> is set to <code>true</code>, then
Files app will allow to add more than one mount points from the UI. If
<code>watchable</code> is <code>false</code>, then a refresh button will be
rendered. Note, that if possible you should add support for watchers, so
changes on the file system can be reflected immediately and automatically.
</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
File System Provider API allows extensions to support virtual file systems,
which are available in the file manager on Chrome OS.
Use cases include decompressing archives and accessing files in a cloud
service other than Drive.
</p>

<h2 id="archives">Mounting file systems</h2>
<p>
Providing extensions can either provide file system contents from an external
source (such as a remote server or a USB device), or using a local file (such as
an archive) as its input.
</p>
<p>
{{?is_apps}}
For file handlers, the providing extension should have a
<a href="manifest/file_handlers">file_handlers</a> manifest entry in order
to be launched when the file is selected in the file manager.
When the extension is executed with a file to be handled, it has to mount a
file system and start serving contents from the provided file.
{{:is_apps}}
In order to write file systems which are file handlers (source is
<code>"file"</code>) the provider must be a packaged app, as the
<code>onLaunched</code>event is not available to extensions.
{{/is_apps}}
</p>
<p>
If the source is network or a device, then the file system should be mounted
when $(ref:onMountRequested) event is called.
</p>
<p>
  <table id="source-table">
    <tr>
      <th>
        <a href="#manifest-source">Source</a> of the file system data
      </th>
      <th>Entry point</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>"file"</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        {{?is_apps}}
          $(ref:app.runtime.onLaunched)
        {{:is_apps}}
          Available to <a href="/apps/fileSystemProvider#source-table">packaged
          apps</a> only.
        {{/is_apps}}
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <code>"device"</code> or <code>"network"</code>
      </td>
      <td>
        $(ref:onMountRequested)
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</p>

<h2 id="archives">Configuring file systems</h2>
<p>
Provided file systems once mounted can be configured via the
$(ref:onConfigureRequested) event. It's especially useful for file systems which
provide contents via network in order to set proper credentials. Handling this
event is optional.
</p>

<h2 id="archives">Life cycle</h2>
<p>
Provided file systems once mounted are remembered by Chrome and remounted
automatically after reboot or restart. Hence, once a file system is
$(ref:mount mounted) by a providing extension, it will stay until either the
extension is unloaded, or the extension calls the $(ref:unmount) method.
</p>
{{?is_apps}}
<p>
In case of acting as a file handler, the handled file may need to be stored
to access it after either a reboot, or suspending and resuming an event page
of the providing extension. In such case $(ref:fileSystem.retainEntry) and
$(ref:fileSystem.restoreEntry) should be used.
