<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>
Use the <code>appview</code> tag to embed other Chrome Apps within your Chrome
App.
</p>

<p>
The <code>appview</code> runs in a separate process from your app, it doesn't
inherit the same permissions and is only allowed to interact with your app
through asynchronous APIs.
Not all apps can be embedded; apps have to explicitly allow themselves to be
embedded.
</p>

<h2 id="embedder">Preparing your app to be embedded</h2>

<p>
To allow your app to be embedded into another app, you need to add a listener
to your app's background page:
</p>

<pre data-filename="background.js">
chrome.app.runtime.onEmbedRequested.addListener(function(request) {
  // Allows the embedder to embed foo.html.
  request.allow("foo.html");
});
</pre>

<h2 id="embedded">Embedding another app</h2>

<p>
To embed another Chrome App in your app, add the <code>appview</code> tag to
your app's embedder page (this is the app page that will display the
embedded app) and use the connect API to request the embedding of the other
app.
</p>

<pre data-filename="background.js">
// Creates an &lt;appview&gt; element.
var appview = document.createElement("appview");
// Appends the element to the document body.
document.body.appendChild(appview);
// Connects the appview to appToEmbed.
// appToEmbed is the id of the app you are trying to embed.
appview.connect(appToEmbed);
</pre>
