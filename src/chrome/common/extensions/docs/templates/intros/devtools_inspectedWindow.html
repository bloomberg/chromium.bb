<p>
Use <code>chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow</code>
to interact with the inspected window:
obtain the tab ID for the inspected page,
evaluate the code in the context of inspected window,
reload the page,
or obtain the list of resources within the page.
</p><p>
See <a href="devtools">DevTools APIs summary</a> for
general introduction to using Developer Tools APIs.
</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
The <code>$(ref:devtools.inspectedWindow.tabId tabId)</code> property
provides the tab identifier that you can use with the
<a href="tabs"><code>chrome.tabs.*</code></a> API calls.
However, please note that <code>chrome.tabs.*</code> API is not
exposed to the Developer Tools extension pages due to security considerations
&mdash; you will need to pass the tab ID to the background page and invoke
the <code>chrome.tabs.*</code> API functions from there.
</p>
<p>
The <code>reload</code> method may be used to reload the inspected page.
Additionally, the caller can specify an override for the user agent string,
a script that will be injected early upon page load, or an option to force
reload of cached resources.
</p><p>
Use the <code>getResources</code> call and the <code>onResourceContent</code>
event to obtain the list of resources (documents, stylesheets, scripts, images
etc) within the inspected page. The <code>getContent</code> and <code
>setContent</code> methods of the <code>Resource</code> class along with the
<code>onResourceContentCommitted</code> event may be used to support
modification of the resource content, for example, by an external editor.
</p>
<h2 id="executing-code">Executing Code in the Inspected Window</h2>
<p>
The <code>eval</code> method provides the ability for extensions to execute
JavaScript code in the context of the inspected page.
This method is powerful when used in the right context
and dangerous when used inappropriately.
Use the <code>$(ref:tabs.executeScript)</code> method
unless you need the specific functionality
that the <code>eval</code> method provides.
</p>
<p>Here are the main differences between the
<code>eval</code> and <code>tabs.executeScript</code> methods:
</p><ul>
<li>The <code>eval</code> method does not
use an isolated world for the code being evaluated, so the JavaScript state
of the inspected window is accessible to the code.
Use this method when access to the JavaScript state of the inspected page
is required.
</li><li>
The execution context of the code being evaluated includes the
<a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/console.html">Developer
Tools console API</a>.
For example,
the code can use <code>inspect</code> and <code>$0</code>.
</li><li>
The evaluated code may return a value that is passed to the extension callback.
The returned value has to be a valid JSON object (it may contain only
primitive JavaScript types and acyclic references to other JSON
objects).

<em>Please observe extra care while processing the data received from the
inspected page &mdash; the execution context is essentially controlled by the
inspected page; a malicious page may affect the data being returned to the
extension.</em>
</li></ul>
<p class="caution">
<strong>Important:</strong>
Due to the security considerations explained above, the
<code>$(ref:tabs.executeScript)</code> method is the preferred way for an
extension to access DOM data of the inspected page in cases where the access to
JavaScript state of the inspected page is not required.
</p>

<p>Note that a page can include multiple different JavaScript execution contexts. Each frame has
its own context, plus an additional context for each extension that has content scripts running
in that frame.</p>
<p>
By default, the <code>eval</code> method executes in the context of the main frame of the
inspected page. </p>

<p>The <code>eval</code> method takes an optional second argument that you can use to specify
the context in which the code is evaluated. This <em>options</em> object can contain one or more of the
following keys:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>frameURL</code></dt>
<dd>Use to specify a frame other than the inspected page's main frame.</dd>
<dt><code>contextSecurityOrigin</code></dt>
<dd>Use to select a context within the specified frame
according to its <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6454.txt">web origin</a>.</dd>
<dt><code>useContentScriptContext</code></dt>
<dd>If true, execute the script in the same context
as the extensions's content scripts. (Equivalent to specifying the extensions's own web orgin
as the context security origin.)
This can be used to exchange data with the content script.</dd>
</dl>


<h2 id="overview-examples">Examples</h2>
<p>The following code checks for the version of jQuery used by the inspected
page:

<pre>
chrome.devtools.inspectedWindow.eval(
    "jQuery.fn.jquery",
     function(result, isException) {
       if (isException)
         console.log("the page is not using jQuery");
       else
         console.log("The page is using jQuery v" + result);
     }
);
</pre>
