<h2 id="ChromeSetting">Chrome settings</h2>

<p>
The <code>ChromeSetting</code> prototype provides a common set of functions
(<code>get()</code>, <code>set()</code>, and <code>clear()</code>) as
well as an event publisher (<code>onChange</code>) for settings of the
Chrome browser. The <a href="proxy#overview-examples">proxy settings
 examples</a> demonstrate how these functions are intended to be used.
</p>

<h3 id="ChromeSetting-lifecycle">Scope and life cycle</h3>

<p>
Chrome distinguishes between three different scopes of browser settings:
<dl>
  <dt><code>regular</code></dt>
  <dd>Settings set in the <code>regular</code> scope apply to regular
  browser windows and are inherited by incognito windows if they are not
  overwritten. These settings are stored to disk and remain in place until
  they are cleared by the governing extension, or the governing extension is
  disabled or uninstalled.</dd>

  <dt><code>incognito_persistent</code></dt>
  <dd>Settings set in the <code>incognito_persistent</code> scope apply only
  to incognito windows. For these, they override <code>regular</code>
  settings. These settings are stored to disk and remain in place until
  they are cleared by the governing extension, or the governing extension is
  disabled or uninstalled.</dd>

  <dt><code>incognito_session_only</code></dt>
  <dd>Settings set in the <code>incognito_session_only</code> scope apply only
  to incognito windows. For these, they override <code>regular</code> and
  <code>incognito_persistent</code> settings. These settings are not
  stored to disk and are cleared when the last incognito window is closed. They
  can only be set when at least one incognito window is open.</dd>

</dl>
</p>

<h3 id="ChromeSetting-precedence">Precedence</h3>

<p>
Chrome manages settings on different layers. The following list describes the
layers that may influence the effective settings, in increasing order of
precedence.
<ol>
  <li>System settings provided by the operating system</li>
  <li>Command-line parameters</li>
  <li>Settings provided by extensions</li>
  <li>Policies</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
As the list implies, policies might overrule any changes that you specify with
your extension. You can use the <code>get()</code> function to determine whether
your extension is capable of providing a setting or whether this setting would
be overridden.
</p>

<p>
As discussed above, Chrome allows using different settings for regular
windows and incognito windows. The following example illustrates the behavior.
Assume that no policy overrides the settings and that an extension can set
settings for regular windows <b>(R)</b> and settings for incognito windows
<b>(I)</b>.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  <li>If only <b>(R)</b> is set, these settings are effective for both
  regular and incognito windows.</li>
  <li>If only <b>(I)</b> is set, these settings are effective for only
  incognito windows. Regular windows use the settings determined by the lower
  layers (command-line options and system settings).</li>
  <li>If both <b>(R)</b> and <b>(I)</b> are set, the respective settings are
  used for regular and incognito windows.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If two or more extensions want to set the same setting to different values,
the extension installed most recently takes precedence over the other
extensions.  If the most recently installed extension sets only <b>(I)</b>, the
settings of regular windows can be defined by previously installed extensions.
</p>

<p>
The <em>effective</em> value of a setting is the one that results from
considering the precedence rules. It is used by Chrome.
