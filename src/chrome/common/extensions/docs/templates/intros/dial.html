<p>The <code>chrome.dial</code> API is backed by a service that multicasts
discovery requests on the local network to discover DIAL-capable devices and
maintains a list of devices that have responded.  Adding an onDeviceList
listener causes the service to periodically issue discovery requests to maintain
the device list. (No polling is done when there are no onDeviceList listeners.)
</p>

<p>The onDeviceList event is fired when discovery respnses are received and in
other circumstances; see the documentation for onDeviceList.</p>

<p>The client can request that network discovery can be done immediately by
invoking discoverNow() which is useful for presenting the user with an
updated list of devices.</p>

<p>On-demand use (updates when discoverNow() is called):
<pre>
chrome.dial.onDeviceList.addListener(function (list) { updateMenu(list); });
chrome.dial.discoverNow();
</pre>
(Remember to remove the listener when the menu closes.)</p>

<p>Background use (updates only when periodic polling happens):</p>

<pre>
var myList;
chrome.dial.onDeviceList.addListener(function (list) { myList = list; });
</pre>

<p>These can be combined to poll for devices to prime the device menu, then
refresh the menu when it is displayed.</p>
