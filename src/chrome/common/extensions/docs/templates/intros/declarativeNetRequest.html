<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>
You must declare the <code>"declarativeNetRequest"</code> permission in the
extension <a href="manifest">manifest</a> to use this API.
<a href="declare_permissions">Host permissions</a> are required if the extension
wants to redirect requests. You must also declare the
<code>"declarative_net_request"</code> manifest key, which should be a
dictionary with a single key called <code>"rule_resources"</code>. It should be
a list containing a single element, the path to a JSON file containing the
declarative rules to use, as shown below.
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
<b>
  "declarative_net_request" : {
    "rule_resources" : ["rules.json"]
  },
  "permissions": [
    "declarativeNetRequest",
    "*://example.com/*"
  ],</b>
  ...
}
</pre>

<h2 id="rule-resources">Rule Resources</h2>

<p>
The JSON file specified as part of <code>"rule_resources"</code> in the manifest
contains a list of rules. The number of rules that an extension can specify is
bound by the <a href="#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_RULES">
chrome.declarativeNetRequest.MAX_NUMBER_OF_RULES</a> constant.
</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<p>
A single declarative rule consists of four fields: <code>id</code>,
<code>priority</code>, <code>condition</code> and <code>action</code>. See the
<a href="#type-Rule">Rule</a> section below for more information on the format.
There are three kinds of rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Rules that block a network request.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rules that prevent a request from getting blocked by negating any matching
    blocked rules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rules that redirect a network request.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An example rule:</p>
<pre>
{
  "id" : 1,
  "action" : { "type" : "block" },
  "condition" : {
    "urlFilter" : "abc",
    "domains" : ["foo.com"],
    "resource_types" : ["script"]
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The above rule will block all script requests originating from
<code>"foo.com"</code> to any URL with <code>"abc"</code> as a substring.
</p>

<p>
The <code>urlFilter</code> field of a rule condition is used to specify the
pattern which is matched against the request URL. Some examples of URL filters:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><code><b>urlFilter</b></code></th>
    <th>Matches</th>
    <th>Does not match</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"abc"</code></td>
    <td>
      https://abcd.com<br/>
      https://example.com/abcd
    </td>
    <td>http://ab.com</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"abc*d"</code></td>
    <td>
      https://abcd.com<br/>
      https://example.com/abcxyzd
    </td>
    <td>http://abc.com</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"||a.example.com"</code></td>
    <td>
      https://a.example.com/<br/>
      https://b.a.example.com/xyz
    </td>
    <td>http://example.com/</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"|https*"</code></td>
    <td>https://example.com</td>
    <td>
      http://example.com/<br/>
      http://https.com
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"example*^123|"</code></td>
    <td>
      https://example.com/123<br/>
      http://abc.com/example?123
    </td>
    <td>
      https://example.com/1234<br/>
      https://abc.com/example0123
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2 id="page-allowlisting">Page allowlisting</h2>

<p>
To disable the extension ruleset on a particular page, extensions can use the
<a href="#method-addAllowedPages">
chrome.declarativeNetRequest.addAllowedPages</a> API. This allows
extensions to specify match patterns that are compared against the tab URL. Any
requests originating from these pages are not evaluated against the extension
ruleset. The number of such patterns an extension can add is bound by the
<a href="#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_ALLOWED_PAGES">chrome.declarativeNetRequest.MAX_NUMBER_OF_ALLOWED_PAGES</a> constant.
</p>

<h2 id="implementation-details">Implementation details</h2>

<h3 id="matching-algorithm">Matching algorithm</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    If any extension ruleset wants to block a request<sup>[1]</sup>, the network
    request is blocked.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the request is not blocked, the request is redirected if any extension
    ruleset wants to redirect the request<sup>[2]</sup>. The most recently
    installed extension gets preference here. If multiple redirect rules from an
    extension’s ruleset match, the rule with the greatest priority determines
    the redirect URL.
  </li>
</ul>

[1] An extension wants to block a request, if all the following are true:
<ul>
  <li>The extension has a matching <code>block</code> rule.</li>
  <li>The extension has no matching <code>allow</code> rule.</li>
  <li>
    The page from which the request originated is not allow-listed by the
    extension using <a href="#method-addAllowedPages">
    chrome.declarativeNetRequest.addAllowedPages</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

[2] An extension wants to redirect a request, if all the following are true:
<ul>
  <li>The extension has a matching <code>redirect</code> rule.</li>
  <li>
    The page from which the request originated is not allow-listed by the
    extension using <a href="#method-addAllowedPages">
    chrome.declarativeNetRequest.addAllowedPages</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="web-request-comparison">
  Comparison with the <a href="webRequest">webRequest</a> API
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The declarativeNetRequest API allows for evaluating network requests in the
    browser itself. This makes it more performant than the webRequest API, where
    each network request is evaluated in JavaScript in the extension process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Because the requests are not intercepted by the extension process,
    declarativeNetRequest removes the need for extensions to have a background
    page; resulting in less memory consumption.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unlike the webRequest API, blocking requests using the declarativeNetRequest
    API requires no host permissions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unlike the webRequest API, redirecting requests using the
    declarativeNetRequest API requires host permissions to both the request URL
    and the request initiator.
  </li>
  <li>
    The declarativeNetRequest API provides better privacy to users because
    extensions can't actually read the network requests made on the user's
    behalf.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unlike the webRequest API, any images or iframes blocked using the
    declarativeNetRequest API are automatically collapsed in the DOM.
  </li>
  <li>
    While deciding whether a request is to be blocked or redirected, the
    declarativeNetRequest API is given priority over the webRequest API because
    it allows for synchronous interception.
  </li>
  <li>
    Evaluation of declarativeNetRequest rulesets is performed during the
    <code>onBeforeRequest</code> stage of a network request. Extensions using
    the webRequest API can intercept requests at different stages of the
    request.
  </li>
  <li>
    The declarativeNetRequest API only allows extensions to block or redirect
    requests. The webRequest api is more flexible as compared to the
    declarativeNetRequest API because it allows extensions to evaluate a request
    programmatically.
  </li>
</ul>
