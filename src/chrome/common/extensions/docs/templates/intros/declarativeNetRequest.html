<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>
You must declare the <code>"declarativeNetRequest"</code> permission in the
extension <a href="manifest">manifest</a> to use this API.
<a href="declare_permissions">Host permissions</a> are required if the extension
wants to redirect requests. You must also declare the
<code>"declarative_net_request"</code> manifest key, which should be a
dictionary with a single key called <code>"rule_resources"</code>. It should be
a list containing a single element, the path to a JSON file containing the
declarative rules to use, as shown below.
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
<b>
  "declarative_net_request" : {
    "rule_resources" : ["rules.json"]
  },
  "permissions": [
    "declarativeNetRequest",
    "*://example.com/*"
  ],</b>
  ...
}
</pre>

<h2 id="rule-resources">Rule Resources</h2>

<p>
The JSON file specified as part of <code>"rule_resources"</code> in the manifest
contains a list of rules. The number of rules that an extension can specify is
bound by the <a href="#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_RULES">
chrome.declarativeNetRequest.MAX_NUMBER_OF_RULES</a> constant.
</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<p>
A single declarative rule consists of four fields: <code>id</code>,
<code>priority</code>, <code>condition</code> and <code>action</code>. See the
<a href="#type-Rule">Rule</a> section below for more information on the format.
There are the following kinds of rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Rules that block a network request.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rules that prevent a request from getting blocked by negating any matching
    blocked rules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rules that redirect a network request.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rules that remove headers from a network request.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An example rule:</p>
<pre>
{
  "id" : 1,
  "action" : { "type" : "block" },
  "condition" : {
    "urlFilter" : "abc",
    "domains" : ["foo.com"],
    "resourceTypes" : ["script"]
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The above rule will block all script requests originating from
<code>"foo.com"</code> to any URL with <code>"abc"</code> as a substring.
</p>

<p>
The <code>urlFilter</code> field of a rule condition is used to specify the
pattern which is matched against the request URL. Some examples of URL filters:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><code><b>urlFilter</b></code></th>
    <th>Matches</th>
    <th>Does not match</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"abc"</code></td>
    <td>
      https://abcd.com<br/>
      https://example.com/abcd
    </td>
    <td>http://ab.com</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"abc*d"</code></td>
    <td>
      https://abcd.com<br/>
      https://example.com/abcxyzd
    </td>
    <td>http://abc.com</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"||a.example.com"</code></td>
    <td>
      https://a.example.com/<br/>
      https://b.a.example.com/xyz
    </td>
    <td>http://example.com/</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"|https*"</code></td>
    <td>https://example.com</td>
    <td>
      http://example.com/<br/>
      http://https.com
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"example*^123|"</code></td>
    <td>
      https://example.com/123<br/>
      http://abc.com/example?123
    </td>
    <td>
      https://example.com/1234<br/>
      https://abc.com/example0123
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2 id="page-allowlisting">Page allowlisting</h2>

<p>
To disable the extension ruleset on a particular page, extensions can use the
<a href="#method-addAllowedPages">
chrome.declarativeNetRequest.addAllowedPages</a> API method. This allows
extensions to specify <a href="/extensions/match_patterns">match patterns</a>
that are compared against the tab URL. Any requests originating from these pages
are not evaluated against the extension ruleset. The number of such patterns an
extension can add is bound by the
<a href="#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_ALLOWED_PAGES">chrome.declarativeNetRequest.MAX_NUMBER_OF_ALLOWED_PAGES</a> constant.
</p>

<h2 id="dynamic-rules">Dynamic rules</h2>

<p>
To add rules dynamically, extensions can use the
<a href="#method-addDynamicRules">
chrome.declarativeNetRequest.addDynamicRules</a> API method.

<ul>
<li>
  The number of dynamic rules that an an extension can add is bounded by the
  <a href="#property-MAX_NUMBER_OF_DYNAMIC_RULES">chrome.declarativeNetRequest.MAX_NUMBER_OF_DYNAMIC_RULES</a>
  constant.
</li>
<li>
  An extension's dynamic ruleset is maintained separately from its static
  ruleset (the ruleset specified as part of the extension package). For example,
  it's possible to have the same rule ID across static and dynamic rulesets.
</li>
<li>
  For conflicting actions, dynamic rules are given priority over static rules.
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2 id="implementation-details">Implementation details</h2>

<h3 id="matching-algorithm">Matching algorithm</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    If any extension ruleset wants to block a request<sup>[1]</sup>, the network
    request is blocked.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the request is not blocked, the request is redirected if any extension
    ruleset wants to redirect the request<sup>[2]</sup>. The most recently
    installed extension gets preference here. If multiple redirect rules from an
    extensionâ€™s ruleset match, the rule with the greatest priority determines
    the redirect URL.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the request is not blocked or redirected, <code>removeHeaders</code>
    rules are evaluated<sup>[3]</sup>. Rules from all extensions are evaluated
    to determine the set of removed headers.
  </li>
</ul>

[1] An extension wants to block a request, if all the following are true:
<ul>
  <li>
      The extension has a matching block rule. Note the priority order between
      the different block/allow actions: <br/>dynamic allow > dynamic block > static allow > static block.
  </li>
  <li>
    The page from which the request originated is not allow-listed by the
    extension using <a href="#method-addAllowedPages">
    chrome.declarativeNetRequest.addAllowedPages</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

[2] An extension wants to redirect a request, if all the following are true:
<ul>
  <li>
      The extension has a matching redirect rule. Note the priority order
      between the different redirect/allow actions: <br/>dynamic allow > dynamic redirect > static allow > static redirect.
  </li>
  <li>
    The page from which the request originated is not allow-listed by the
    extension using <a href="#method-addAllowedPages">
    chrome.declarativeNetRequest.addAllowedPages</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

[3] An extension wants to remove a header from a request, if all the following
are true:
<ul>
  <li>
      The extension has a matching removeHeaders rule. Note the priority order
      between the different removeHeaders/allow actions: <br/>dynamic allow > dynamic removeHeaders > static allow > static removeHeaders.
  </li>
  <li>
    The page from which the request originated is not allow-listed by the
    extension using <a href="#method-addAllowedPages">
    chrome.declarativeNetRequest.addAllowedPages</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="web-request-comparison">
  Comparison with the <a href="webRequest">webRequest</a> API
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The declarativeNetRequest API allows for evaluating network requests in the
    browser itself. This makes it more performant than the webRequest API, where
    each network request is evaluated in JavaScript in the extension process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Because the requests are not intercepted by the extension process,
    declarativeNetRequest removes the need for extensions to have a background
    page; resulting in less memory consumption.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unlike the webRequest API, blocking requests or removing headers using the
    declarativeNetRequest API requires no host permissions.
  </li>
  <li>
    The declarativeNetRequest API provides better privacy to users because
    extensions can't actually read the network requests made on the user's
    behalf.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unlike the webRequest API, any images or iframes blocked using the
    declarativeNetRequest API are automatically collapsed in the DOM.
  </li>
  <li>
    While deciding whether a request is to be blocked or redirected, the
    declarativeNetRequest API is given priority over the webRequest API because
    it allows for synchronous interception. Similarly, any headers removed
    through declarativeNetRequest API are not made visible to web request
    extensions.
  </li>
  <li>
    The webRequest API is more flexible as compared to the declarativeNetRequest
    API because it allows extensions to evaluate a request programmatically.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Consider a navigation to <code>"http://google.com"</code>. Rules with id (1)

    higher priority than redirect rules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider a navigation to <code>"http://google.com/1234"</code>. Rules with
    id (1), (2), and (3) match. Because the request has a matching

  </li>
  <li>
    Consider a navigation to <code>"http://abcd.com"</code>. The rule with id

  <li>
