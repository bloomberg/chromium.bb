<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>
Typical usage of this API to expose client certificates to Chrome OS follows these steps:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Extension registers for the events
    $(ref:onCertificatesRequested) and $(ref:onSignDigestRequested).
  </li>
  <li>During a TLS handshake, the browser receives a client certificate request.
    With a $(ref:onCertificatesRequested) event, the browser asks the Extension
    to report all certificates that it currently provides.
  </li>
  <li>The Extension reports back with the currently available certificates,
    using the callback that was provided with the event.
  </li>
  <li>The browser matches all available certificates with the client certificate
    request from the remote host. The matches are presented to the user in a
    selection dialog.
  </li>
  <li>The user can select a certificate and thereby approve the authentication
    or abort the authentication.

  </p>
  </li>
  <li>If the user aborts the authentication or no certificate matched the
    request, the TLS client authentication is aborted.
  </li>
  <li>Otherwise, if the user approves the authentication with a certificate
    provided by this Extension, the browser requests the Extension to sign a
    digest to continue the TLS handshake. The request is sent as a
    $(ref:onSignDigestRequested) event.
  </li>
  <li>This event contains a digest, declares which hash function was used to
    create the digest, and refers to one of the certificates that were reported
    by this Extension in reaction to the most recent certificate request. The
    Extension must create a signature for the given digest using the private key
    associated with the referenced certificate. Creating the signature might
    require prepending a DigestInfo and padding the result before the actual
    signing.
  </li>
  <li>The Extension sends back the signature to the browser using the callback
    that was provided as part of the event. If the signature couldn't be
    calculated, the callback is called without signature.
  </li>
  <li>If the signature was provided, the browser completes the TLS handshake.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The actual sequence of steps can be different. For example, the user will not be
asked to select a certificate if the enterprise policy to automatically select a
certificate is used (see
<a href="https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3#AutoSelectCertificateForUrls">AutoSelectCertificateForUrls</a>
and
<a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/2657289?hl=en#AutoSelectCertificateForUrls">Chrome policies for users</a>).
</p>

<p>
In the Extension, this can look similar to the following snippet:
</p>

<pre data-filename="background.js">
function onCertificatesRejected(rejectedCerts) {
  // If certificates were rejected by the API, log an error, for example.
  console.error(rejectedCerts.length + ' certificates were rejected.');
}

function reportCertificates(reportCallback) {
  var certs = [];
  // Fill |certs| with all certificates that this Extension provides.
  // For example:
  var certInfo = {
    certificate: new Uint8Array(...),
    supportedHashes: ['SHA256']
  };
  certs.push(certInfo);

  reportCallback(certs, function(rejectedCerts) {
    if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
      // Handle API errors, like argument type errors.
      return;
    }
    if (rejectedCerts.length !== 0)
      onCertificatesRejected(rejectedCerts);
  });
}

// Returns a private key handle for the given DER-encoded certificate.
// |certificate| is an ArrayBuffer.
function getPrivateKeyHandle(certificate) {...}

// If required, prepends |digest| with a DigestInfo and pads the result
// according to the key type and the given Hash function.
// |digest| is an ArrayBuffer. |hash| is a $(ref:Hash). Returns an ArrayBuffer.
function prepareDigest(digest, hash) {...}

// Signs |digest| with the given private key. |digest| is an ArrayBuffer.
// Returns the signature as ArrayBuffer.
function signDigest(privateKey, digest) {...}

function reportSignature(signRequest, reportCallback) {
  // Look up the handle to the private key of |signRequest.certificate|.
  var key = getPrivateKeyHandle(signRequest.certificate);
  if (!key) {
    // Handle if the key isn't available.
    console.error('Key for requested certificate no available.');

    // Abort the request by reporting the error to the API.
    reportCallback();
    return;
  }

  var preparedDigest = prepareDigest(signRequest.digest, signRequest.hash);
  var signature = signDigest(key, preparedDigest);

  reportCallback(signature);
}

chrome.certificateProvider.onCertificatesRequested.addListener(
    reportCertificates);
chrome.certificateProvider.onSignDigestRequested.addListener(
    reportSignature);
</pre>
