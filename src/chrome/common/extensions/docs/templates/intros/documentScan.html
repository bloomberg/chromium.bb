<p>
The Document Scan API is designed to allow apps and extensions to view
the content of paper documents on an attached document scanner.

<b>Note:</b>
This API depends on OS features that may not be available depending on the
underlying operating system.  As of this writing only Chrome OS for certain
USB-attached devices is known to successfully work.
