<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>
By default,
operating systems dim the screen when users are inactive
and eventually suspend the system.
With the power API,
an app or extension can keep the system awake.
</p>

<p>
Using this API,
you can specify the
$(ref:Level) to which power management is disabled.
The <code>"system"</code> level keeps the system active,
but allows the screen to be dimmed or turned off.
For example,
a communication app can continue to receive messages
while the screen is off.
The <code>"display"</code> level keeps the screen and system active.
E-book and presentation apps, for example,
can keep the screen and system active
while users read.
</p>

<p>
When a user has more than one app or extension active,
each with its own power level,
the highest-precedence level takes effect;
<code>"display"</code> always takes precedence
over <code>"system"</code>.
For example,
if app A asks for <code>"system"</code> power management,
and app B asks for <code>"display"</code>,
<code>"display"</code> is used until app B
is unloaded or releases its request.
If app A is still active,
<code>"system"</code> is then used.
