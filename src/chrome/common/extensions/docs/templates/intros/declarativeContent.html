<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>
The Declarative Content API allows you to show your extension's
$(ref:pageAction page action) depending on the URL of a web page and
the CSS selectors its content matches, without needing to take a <a
href="declare_permissions#host-permissions">host permission</a> or
inject a <a href="content_scripts">content script</a>.  Use the
<a href="activeTab">activeTab</a> permission in order to be able
to interact with a page after the user clicks on your page action.
</p>

<p>
If you need more precise control over when your page action appears or
you need to change its appearance to match the current tab before the
user clicks on it, you'll have to keep using the $(ref:pageAction) API.
</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<p>As a <a href="events#declarative">declarative API</a>, this
API lets you register rules on the
<code>$(ref:onPageChanged)</code> $(ref:events.Event event) object which take an
action (<code>$(ref:ShowPageAction)</code> and <code>$(ref:SetIcon)</code>) when
a set of conditions, represented as a
<code>$(ref:PageStateMatcher)</code>, are met.
</p>

<p>
The <code>$(ref:PageStateMatcher)</code> matches web pages if and only
if all listed criteria are met. The following rule would show a page
action for pages on <code>https://www.google.com/</code> when a
password field is present on it:
</p>

<pre>
var rule1 = {
  conditions: [
    new $(ref:PageStateMatcher chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher)({
      $(ref:PageStateMatcher.pageUrl pageUrl): { $(ref:events.UrlFilter.hostEquals hostEquals): 'www.google.com', $(ref:events.UrlFilter.schemes schemes): ['https'] },
      $(ref:PageStateMatcher.css css): ["input[type='password']"]
    })
  ],
  actions: [ new $(ref:ShowPageAction chrome.declarativeContent.ShowPageAction)() ]
};
</pre>

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> All conditions and actions are created via a constructor
as shown in the example above.
</p>

<p>
In order to also show a page action for sites with a video, you can
add a second condition, as each condition is sufficient to trigger all
specified actions:
</p>
<pre>
var rule2 = {
  conditions: [
    new $(ref:PageStateMatcher chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher)({
      $(ref:PageStateMatcher.pageUrl pageUrl): { $(ref:events.UrlFilter.hostEquals hostEquals): 'www.google.com', $(ref:events.UrlFilter.schemes schemes): ['https'] },
      $(ref:PageStateMatcher.css css): ["input[type='password']"]
    })<strong>,
    new $(ref:PageStateMatcher chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher)({
      $(ref:PageStateMatcher.css css): ["video"]
    })</strong>
  ],
  actions: [ new $(ref:ShowPageAction chrome.declarativeContent.ShowPageAction)() ]
};
</pre>

<p>
<a href="events#addingrules">Added rules</a> are saved across
browser restarts, so register them as follows:
</p>
<pre>
$(ref:runtime.onInstalled chrome.runtime.onInstalled).addListener(function(details) {
  $(ref:onPageChanged chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged).<a href="events#removingrules">removeRules</a>(undefined, function() {
    $(ref:onPageChanged chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged).<a href="events#addingrules">addRules</a>([rule2]);
  });
});
</pre>

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> You should always register or unregister rules in bulk
rather than individually because each of these operations recreates internal
data structures.  This re-creation is computationally expensive but facilitates
a faster matching algorithm.
</p>

<p>
Combine the above rule with the <a href="activeTab">activeTab</a>
permission to create an extension that doesn't need any install-time
permissions but can invite the user to click its page action on
relevant pages and can run on those pages when the user clicks the
page action.
</p>

<h2 id="css-matching">CSS Matching</h2>

<p>$(ref:PageStateMatcher.css) conditions must be
<i><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#compound">compound selectors</a></i>,
meaning that you can't
include <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/webed/wiki/CSS/Selectors#Combinators">combinators</a>
like whitespace or "<code>&gt;</code>" in your selectors.  This helps Chrome
match the selectors more efficiently.</p>

<table>
  <tr><th>Compound Selectors (OK)</th><th>Complex Selectors (Not OK)</th></tr>
  <tr><td><code>a</code></td><td><code>div p</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>iframe.special[src^='http']</code></td><td><code>p>span.highlight</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>ns|*</code></td><td><code>p + ol</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>#abcd:checked</code></td><td><code>p::first-line</code></td></tr>
</table>

<p>CSS conditions only match displayed elements: if an element that matches your
selector is <code>display:none</code> or one of its parent elements
is <code>display:none</code>, it doesn't cause the condition to match.  Elements
styled with <code>visibility:hidden</code>, positioned off-screen, or hidden by
other elements can still make your condition match.</p>


<h2 id="css-matching">Bookmarked State Matching</h2>

<p>The $(ref:PageStateMatcher.isBookmarked) condition allows matching of the
bookmarked state of the current URL in the user's profile. To make use of this
condition the "bookmarks" permission must be declared in
the <a href="manifest">extension manifest</a></p>
