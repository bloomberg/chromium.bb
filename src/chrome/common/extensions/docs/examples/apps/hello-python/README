Hello License Python
====================

Overview
--------
This application implements a sample client for the Chrome Web Store Licensing
API on Google's Python App Engine service.

For information about this API, please see:
http://code.google.com/chrome/webstore/

Usage
-----
First, register an App Engine app at www.appspot.com.  Make sure you select
Federated Login as the login provider for the app.

You'll need to configure this sample before it will be functional.  Edit
app.yaml and replace the text INSERT APPLICATION NAME HERE with the application
identifier you registered.

Second, obtain a token for the Chrome Web Store license server.  Check the
license server documentation for instructions on how to do this.  Edit main.py
and replace the following three configuration lines with your own information:

  'oauth_token': 'INSERT OAUTH TOKEN HERE',
  'oauth_token_secret': 'INSERT OAUTH TOKEN SECRET HERE',
  'app_id': 'INSERT APPLICATION ID HERE',

Then deploy your application to App Engine, and you will be able to log in
with OpenID and check the license status of your account.
