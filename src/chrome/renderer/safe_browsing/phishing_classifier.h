// This class handles the process of extracting all of the features from a
// page and computing a phishyness score.  The basic steps are:
//  - Run each feature extractor over the page, building up a FeatureMap of
//    feature -> value.
//  - SHA-256 hash all of the feature names in the map so that they match the
//    supplied model.
//  - Hand the hashed map off to a Scorer, which computes the probability that
//    the page is phishy.
//  - If the page is phishy, run the supplied callback.
//
// For more details, see phishing_*_feature_extractor.h, scorer.h, and
// client_model.proto.
