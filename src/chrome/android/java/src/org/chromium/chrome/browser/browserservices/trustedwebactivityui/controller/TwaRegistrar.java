     * 1) App verifies with https://www.myfirsttwa.com/.
     * 2) App verifies with https://www.mysecondtwa.com/.
     * 3) App launches a TWA to https://www.myfirsttwa.com/.
     * 4) App navigates to https://www.mysecondtwa.com/.
     *
     * At step 2, we don't know why the app is verifying with that origin (it could be for TWAs or
     * for PostMessage). Only at step 4 do we know that Chrome should associate the browsing data
     * for that origin with that app.
