/**
 * Helper class for retrieving a device-unique hash for an Android package name.
 *
 * This is used to counter a potential timing attack against the getInstalledRelatedApps API, by
 * adding a pseudo-random time delay to the query. The delay is a hash of a globally unique
 * identifier for the current browser session, and the package name, which means websites are unable
 * to predict what each user's delay will be, nor compare between apps on a given device.
 *
 * The salt is generated per browser session (not per query, page load, user or device) because it
 * we want it to change "occasionally" -- not too frequently, but sometimes. Each time the salt
 * changes, it gives the site another opportunity to collect data that could be averaged out to
 * cancel out the random noise and find the true timing. So we don't want it changing too often.
 * However, it does need to change periodically: because installing or uninstalling the app creates
 * a noticeable change to the timing of the operation, we need to occasionally change the salt to
 * create plausible deniability (the attacker can't tell the difference between the salt changing
 * and the app being installed/uninstalled).
