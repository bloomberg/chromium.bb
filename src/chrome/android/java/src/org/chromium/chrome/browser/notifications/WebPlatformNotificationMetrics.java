/**
 * This class collects metrics about what happens when the user interacts with web platform
 * notifications, for example how long it takes to show an Activity after a notification is clicked,
 * or if an Activity is shown at all.
 *
 * Unfortunately, it would be very difficult to follow the code execution from the point a
 * notification is clicked all the way to when an Activity is launched, so we use static state and
 * call methods on this class from seemingly disparate places. A consequence of this is that we
 * don't know for sure whether an Activity being focused is the result of a notification, so we use
 * the heuristic that if an Activity focus occurs within 5 seconds after a notification click, that
 * counts.
