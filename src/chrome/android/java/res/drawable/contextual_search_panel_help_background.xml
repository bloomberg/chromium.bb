<!-- This background insets another background by a fixed amount.
     The inset amount comes from the UX design and is crafted to match
     the inset of the rounded frame of individual search results displayed
     in the search results page. No bottom inset is needed because the
     next thing shown (usually the content) has its own inset. -->
