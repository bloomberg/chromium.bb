// This class represents the state of a transceiver; a snapshot of what a
// webrtc-layer transceiver looked like when it was inspected on the signaling
// thread such that this information can be moved to the main thread in a single
// PostTask. It is used to surface state changes to make the blink-layer
// transceiver up-to-date.
//
// Blink objects live on the main thread and webrtc objects live on the
// signaling thread. If multiple asynchronous operations begin execution on the
// main thread they are posted and executed in order on the signaling thread.
// For example, operation A and operation B are called in JavaScript. When A is
// done on the signaling thread, webrtc object states will be updated. A
// callback is posted to the main thread so that blink objects can be updated to
// match the result of operation A. But if callback A tries to inspect the
// webrtc objects from the main thread this requires posting back to the
// signaling thread and waiting, which also includes waiting for the previously
// posted task: operation B. Inspecting the webrtc object like this does not
// guarantee you to get the state of operation A.
//
// As such, all state changes associated with an operation have to be surfaced
// in the same callback. This includes copying any states into a separate object
// so that it can be inspected on the main thread without any additional thread
// hops.
//
// The RtpTransceiverState is a snapshot of what the
// webrtc::RtpTransceiverInterface looked like when the RtpTransceiverState was
// created on the signaling thread. It also takes care of initializing sender
// and receiver states, including their track adapters such that we have access
// to a blink track corresponding to the webrtc tracks of the sender and
// receiver.
//
// Except for initialization logic and operator=(), the RtpTransceiverState is
// immutable and only accessible on the main thread.
//
// TODO(hbos): [Onion Soup] When the transceiver implementation is moved to
// blink this will be part of the blink transceiver instead of the content
// transceiver. https://crbug.com/787254

// RTCRtpTransceiver::set_state() performs differently depending on the update
// mode. The update mode exists to get around problems with the webrtc threading
// model: https://crbug.com/webrtc/8692.
//
// Transceiver state information can be surfaced as a result of invoking a
// number of different JavaScript APIs. The way states are surfaced from webrtc
// to content/blink fall into two categories:
//   Blocking operations and callback-based operations.
//
// When a blocking operation is invoked, the main thread is blocked on the
// webrtc signaling thread, and the state information is surfaced immediately
// - guaranteed to be up-to-date. An example of this is addTrack().
// Callback-based operations on the other hand will post a task from the
// signaling thread to the main thread, placing the task to update the state
// information in queue. There is no guarantee that something - such as
// addTrack() - doesn't happen in-between the posting of the task and the
// execution of it. In such cases, the state information surfaced might not be
// up-to-date (in edge cases). Examples of callback-based operations include
// setLocalDescription() and setRemoteDescription().
