 * many times as needed (for instance, multiple activities for the same application), but the
 * browser process will still only be initialized once. All requests to start the browser will
 * always get their callback executed; if the browser process has already been started, the callback
 * is called immediately, else it is called when initialization is complete.
 *
 * All communication with this class must happen on the main thread.
