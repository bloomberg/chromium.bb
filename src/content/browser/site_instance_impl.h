// SiteInfo represents the principal of a SiteInstance. All documents and
// workers within a SiteInstance are considered part of this principal and will
// share a renderer process. Any two documents within the same browsing context
// group (i.e., BrowsingInstance) that are allowed to script each other *must*
// have the same SiteInfo principal, so that they end up in the same renderer
// process.
//
// As a result, SiteInfo is primarily defined in terms of "site URL," which is
// often the scheme plus the eTLD+1 of a URL. This allows same-site URLs to
// always share a process even when document.domain is modified. However, some
// site URLs can be finer grained (e.g., origins) or coarser grained (e.g.,
// file://). See |site_url()| for more considerations.
//
// In the future, we may add more information to SiteInfo for cases where the
// site URL is not sufficient to identify which process a document belongs in.
// For example, origin isolation (https://crbug.com/1067389) will introduce a
// 'keying' bit ('site' or 'origin') to avoid an ambiguity between sites and
// origins, and it will be possible for two SiteInstances with different keying
// values to have the same site URL. It is important that any extra members of
// SiteInfo do not cause two documents that can script each other to end up in
// different SiteInfos and thus different processes.
