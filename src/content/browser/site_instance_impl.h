// This struct is used to package a GURL together with extra state required to
// make SiteInstance/process allocation decisions, e.g. whether the url's
// origin or site is requesting isolation as determined by response headers in
// the corresponding NavigationRequest. The extra state is generally most
// relevant when navigation to the URL is in progress, since once placed into a
// SiteInstance, the extra state will be available via SiteInfo. Otherwise,
// most callsites requiring a UrlInfo can create with a GURL, specifying kNone
// for |origin_isolation_request|. Some examples of where passing kNone for
// |origin_isolation_request| is safe are:
// * at DidCommitNavigation time, since at that point the SiteInstance has
//   already been picked and the navigation can be considered finished,
// * before a response is received (the only way to request isolation is via
//   response headers), and
// * outside of a navigation.
//
// If UrlInfo::origin_isolation_request is kNone, that does *not* imply that
// the URL's origin will not be isolated, and vice versa.  The isolation
// decision involves both response headers and consistency within a
// BrowsingInstance, and once we decide on the isolation outcome for an origin,
// it won't change for the lifetime of the BrowsingInstance.
//
// To check whether a frame ends up in a site-isolated process, use
// SiteInfo::RequiresDedicatedProcess() on its SiteInstance's SiteInfo.  To
// check whether a frame ends up being origin-isolated (e.g., due to the

// have the same SiteInfo principal, so that they end up in the same renderer
// process.
//
// As a result, SiteInfo is primarily defined in terms of "site URL," which is
// often the scheme plus the eTLD+1 of a URL. This allows same-site URLs to
// always share a process even when document.domain is modified. However, some
// site URLs can be finer grained (e.g., origins) or coarser grained (e.g.,
// file://). See |site_url()| for more considerations.
//
// In the future, we may add more information to SiteInfo for cases where the
// site URL is not sufficient to identify which process a document belongs in.
// For example, origin isolation (https://crbug.com/1067389) will introduce a
// 'keying' bit ('site' or 'origin') to avoid an ambiguity between sites and
// origins, and it will be possible for two SiteInstances with different keying
// values to have the same site URL. It is important that any extra members of
// SiteInfo do not cause two documents that can script each other to end up in
// different SiteInfos and thus different processes.
