# Aggregation service

This directory contains the implementation of the client-side logic for the [Aggregation service](https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api/blob/main/AGGREGATE.md#data-processing-through-the-aggregation-service) proposed for the [Attribution Reporting API](https://github.com/WICG/conversion-measurement-api).

## Command-line tool
A command-line tool that generates aggregatable reports for testing is available. Please see //tools/aggregation_service's [README](../../../tools/aggregation_service/README.md) for more detail

**TODO**: Expand this README.
