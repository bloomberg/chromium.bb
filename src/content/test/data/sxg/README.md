The key and certificate files (`*.key`, `*.csr`, `*.pem`) are
generated by `generate-test-certs.sh` in this directory. It requires `openssl`
be installed.

The certificate cbor files (`*.cbor`) and the signed exchange files (`*.sxg`) in
this directory are generated using `generate-test-sxgs.sh`.

`generate-test-sxgs.sh` requires command-line tools in the
[webpackage repository](https://github.com/WICG/webpackage). To install them,
run:

```
go get -u github.com/WICG/webpackage/go/signedexchange/cmd/...
```

The revision of the tools used to generate the test files is `99155ec`.
