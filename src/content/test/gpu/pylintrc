# Pylint, or at least v1.5.6, does not properly handle adding comments between
# lines of disable= entries, nor does it allow multiple disable= lines, so
# we can't comment inline about why any of the above can't be removed. Thus,
# that information is here.

# duplicate-code
# There is a bug in Pylint that prevents duplicate-code from being disabled for
# blocks of code, see https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/214. Since
# duplicate-code causes parts of the harness_script strings to be detected as
# duplicates, and there isn't a good solution to actually fix that, we need to
# keep this disabled until a fix is implemented and the Pylint version we use is
# upgraded.

# fixme
# This complains about TODOs, which are perfectly valid to have.

# invalid-name
# The default regular expressions for name validation don't like the conventions
# many Chromium Python files use, namely the use of upper camel case for method
# names. The regular expressions could be updated to handle this properly, but
# that would likely be part of a repo-wide linter update.

# locally-disabled/locally-enabled
# There are valid cases where we want to selectively enable/disable lint errors
# in a particular file/scope, e.g. allowing protected access in unittests.
