# included in each query instead of running it once by itself and including the
# returned data in other queries because we can end up getting a very large
# number of build IDs, which can push the query over BigQuery's hard query size
# limit. The query runs pretty quickly (within a couple of seconds), so
# duplicating it does not add much runtime.
