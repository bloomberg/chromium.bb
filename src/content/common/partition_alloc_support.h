  // *Earlyish() is called as early as it is reasonably possible.
  // *AfterZygoteFork() is its complement to finish configuring process-specific
  // stuff that had to be postponed due to *Earlyish() being called with
  // |process_type==kZygoteProcess|.
  // *AfterFeatureListInit() is called in addition to the above, once
  // FeatureList has been initialized and ready to use. It is guaranteed to be
  // called on non-zygote processes or after the zygote has been forked.
  // *AfterTaskRunnerInit() is called once it is possible to post tasks, and
  // after the previous steps.
  //
  // *Earlyish() must be called exactly once. *AfterZygoteFork() must be called
  // once iff *Earlyish() was called before with |process_type==kZygoteProcess|.
  //
  // *AfterFeatureListInit() may be called more than once, but will perform its
  // re-configuration steps exactly once.
