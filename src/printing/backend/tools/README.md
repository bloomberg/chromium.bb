# IPP Attribute code generation

This directory contains tools to generate mapping from IPP attribute name to a
handler appropriate for its type. The authoritative source for
[ipp-registrations-2.csv](ipp-registrations-2.csv) is the
[registrations page hosted by IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipp-registrations/ipp-registrations.xhtml)
([direct link to Attributes CSV](https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipp-registrations/ipp-registrations-2.csv)).

If CSV is updated one should be able to drop the new version as is.
