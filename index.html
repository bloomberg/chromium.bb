<h2>Branches</h2>
<p>This section will describe each branch and what changes they introduce.
Note that some of these changes have been contributed upstream.  Our intention
is to contribute as many changes upstream as possible so that we do not have to
maintain these branches in our repository.</p>
<p>However, we realize that some of these changes are made in order to adjust
the behavior of our own product, and may not be desirable/applicable to the
general web.  For example, the way the
<code>&lt;delete&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;backspace&gt;</code> keys work inside
table cells, the way indenting/outdenting of list items work, etc.  Therefore,
we will probably not be able to send <em>everything</em> upstream.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-anonymousPseudoStyle">bugfix/anonymousPseudoStyle</a> (Shezan Baig; D39210769; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110648">110648</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/anonymousPseudoStyle.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
The selection gaps after "hello" and "world" do not honor the selection
background color specified in the CSS.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-autocorrectcaret2">bugfix/autocorrectcaret2</a> (Calum Robinson)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-backspaceIntoTable">bugfix/backspaceIntoTable</a> (Shezan Baig; D32947240)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/backspaceIntoTable.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
put the cursor between 'T' and 'e' in "Testing", and hit backspace twice.  The
rest of the text will go into the last cell.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether this is a bug that can be upstreamed or not, because
the comment in the code specifically mentions that this is the intended
behavior, and has been since at least 2007.  However, we changed this behavior
in our product to match what Firefox does, which is to make the second
backspace a no-op.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-badquerycommand">bugfix/badquerycommand</a> (Shezan Baig; D32128551)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/badquerycommand.html">this link</a> in Chrome, click
the yellow div and hit <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code> a bunch of times. Then
<code>&lt;shift&gt;</code>+<code>&lt;up&gt;</code> a bunch of times. Each time
you press <code>&lt;up&gt;</code>, the result of
<code>queryCommandValue('bold')</code> changes inconsistently.<p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cancelErrorNotNull">bugfix/cancelErrorNotNull</a> (Zhen Yin)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cellInMulticol">bugfix/cellInMulticol</a> (Shezan Baig; D34079255)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/cellInMulticol.html">this link</a> in Chrome and keep
resizing the window. You will see that the table cells get split when they
reach column boundaries.</p>
<p>This is a rather complicated patch and requires a bunch of additional work
before it can be sent upstream.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-checkSpellcheckAttrBeforeMark">bugfix/checkSpellcheckAttrBeforeMark</a> (Tianyin Zhang; D37544856)</h3>
<p>This patch fixed a bug where text under elements having spellcheck attribute set to false got spellchecked. To see the bug, open <a href="repros/checkSpellcheckAttrBeforeMark.html">This Link</a> in Chrome</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-clearDragCaret">bugfix/clearDragCaret</a> (Shezan Baig; D31916022)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/clearDragCaret.html">this link</a> in Chrome, then
select some text from another tab, and try to drag it into the editable div.
Before you drop, you will see a caret at the place where the text should go.
When you drop however, <code>event.preventDefault()</code> is called, so the
text does not get inserted. However, the drag caret remains visible.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cleartypecanvas">bugfix/cleartypecanvas</a> (Shezan Baig; D32281407; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86776">86776</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/cleartypecanvas">this link</a> in Chrome, and notice
that the canvas element does not use ClearType fonts even though
<code>subpixel-antialiased</code> is used.</p> <p>Note that when painting to an
<code>ImageBuffer</code>, Chromium disables ClearType even if it is the default
on the system.  However, in our case, we are explicitly requesting it in the
document, so this change makes Chromium honor the
<code>-webkit-font-smoothing</code> setting if it is requested explicitly.</p>
<p>Note that there are two distinct changes introduced by this branch:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>-webkit-font-smoothing</code> setting has no effect in Windows for Skia.
This is the change that is being tracked upstream by WebKit bug
<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86776">86776</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't disable ClearType on <code>ImageBuffer</code> if it was explicitly requested.
This is not yet being tracked upstream.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="bugfix-contractionFix">bugfix/contractionFix</a> (Edward Christie)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>


<h3><a name="bugfix-ctrlShiftRight">bugfix/ctrlShiftRight</a> (Claudio Saavedra &lt;csaavedra@igalia.com&gt;; D37320855; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=110487">110487</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/ctrlShiftRight.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and use
Ctrl+Shift+Right to extend selection to the next word.  Without this branch,
you will notice that the space after words is not included in the
selection.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-cursorContext">bugfix/cursorContext</a> (Shezan Baig; D35952365)</h3>
<p>It is somewhat hard to reproduce, the window height needs to be just about
right.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/cursorContext.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and hit
Enter until the cursor is at the last possible line where the scrollbar does
not appear.  Make sure there is just enough space for about half a line
more.</p>
<p>Now keep typing on this line, letting it word-wrap which causes the scrollbar
to appear.  Keep doing this for a few lines.  You will notice that on some
lines (usually the second or the third, then every alternating line after
that), the scrollbar does not scroll down completely.</p>
<p>In our product, there is an overlay around the RTE of about a couple of pixels.
The purpose of the padding on the contenteditable was to prevent this overlay
from covering the text.  However, since the bottom of the text was right
against the border of the <code>content-editable</code>, this was causing the
descent of some characters to be obscured.</p>
<p>We "fixed" this in this branch by inflating the reveal rect by about half the
cursor height, showing more "context" when moving up and down in a scrollable
contenteditable.  However, a proper fix would be to make the last line scroll
completely, taking the padding into account.  We haven't gotten around to this
yet.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-doubleindent">bugfix/doubleindent</a> (Shezan Baig; D32165963)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/doubleindent.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
position the cursor before the logo.  Indent the image twice, then outdent the
image twice.  There will be one level of indentation still left.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-emptycellcaret">bugfix/emptycellcaret</a> (Shezan Baig; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85385">85385</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/emptycellcaret.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and put
the caret inside an empty table cell.  The caret's <code>y-position</code> is
outside the <code>table-cell</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-fix-modal-loop">bugfix/fix-modal-loop</a> (Imran Haider)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-iframeZoom">bugfix/iframeZoom</a> (Shezan Baig; D34484409)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/iframeZoom.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and zoom the
page in and out.  The content outside the <code>iframe</code> zooms, but the
content inside the <code>iframe</code> does not zoom.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-imgresample">bugfix/imgresample</a> (Shezan Baig; D32353761)</h3>
<p>The change for this branch is only noticable when the <code><a
        href="#bugfix-svgscale">bugfix/svgscale</a></code> branch has been
applied to make SVG images scale properly.  Therefore, we cannot reproduce the
issue in Chrome until bug <a
    href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85335">85335</a> is fixed
upstream.  However, we can build a <code>test_shell</code> with
<code>bugfix/svgscale</code> merged in to test this.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/svgscale.html">this link</a> in a
<code>test_shell</code> that has been patched with
<code>bugfix/svgscale</code>.  The second icon is using an
<code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, and the third icon is using an
<code>&lt;embed&gt;</code> element.  Without the
<code>bugfix/imgresample</code> patch, the second icon appears a little fuzzier
than the third icon (you may need to zoom in to the pixel level to notice the
difference).</p>
<p>Once the <code>bugfix/imgresample</code> patch is applied, the second icon
matches the third icon more closely.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-indentpre">bugfix/indentpre</a> (Shezan Baig; D31922188)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/indentpre.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The "Hello"
text will be selected on load.  Each time you indent the text, the "Hello" will
get duplicated.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-justifyprewrap">bugfix/justifyprewrap</a> (Shezan Baig; D31916947; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84448">84448</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/justifyprewrap.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
second paragraph will not be justified, even though
<code>text-align:justify</code> is specified.</p>
<p>There is an upstream ticket for this issue, but it calls for a much more
comprehensive fix than what was done in this branch.  In this branch, we just
enable the existing justification logic in elements that have
<code>whitespace:pre-wrap</code> specified, but the upstream ticket calls for
modification to the justification logic itself to match how Microsoft Word
software works.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-listifySpans">bugfix/listifySpans</a> (Shezan Baig; D37507315)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/listifySpans.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The second
and third list items will be selected.  Click on the <code>OL</code> button to
convert these items to an ordered list.  The second and third list items get
placed into separate lists, but they should be on the same list.  Note that
this doesn't happen if the first and second items are selected instead.</p>


<h3><a name="bugfix-mouseLeaveMousePosition">bugfix/mouseLeaveMousePosition</a> (Zhen Yin)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-noBRAtStartOfPara">bugfix/noBRAtStartOfPara</a> (Shezan Baig; D36813987)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/noBRAtStartOfPara.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
contents of the table will be selected on load.  Hit the "List" button multiple
times.  Each click executes the <code>insertOrderedList</code> command.</p>
<p>On every second click, the table will move down.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-noRelayoutIfPercentSame">bugfix/noRelayoutIfPercentSame</a> (Shezan Baig; D36633185)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-nonWindowContexts">bugfix/nonWindowContexts</a> (Shezan Baig)</h3>
<p>Note: This branch has been miscategorized as a bugfix, it is actually a feature
that we wanted specifically for our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch removes the assumption that every V8 context has a <code>DOMWindow</code>
associated with it.  This is necessary for our product because we have multiple
V8 contexts living in the same process that need to share data with each other.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-nonemptycellbackspace">bugfix/nonemptycellbackspace</a> (Shezan Baig)</h3>
<p>Note: This branch has been miscategorized as a bugfix, it is actually a
feature that we wanted specifically for our product, so it is unlikely that we
will send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch makes it so that hitting <code>&lt;backspace&gt;</code> when the
cursor is at the beginning of a table cell will be a no-op.  The default
behavior in WebKit is to move into the previous cell and start deleting from
there.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/nonemptycellbackspace.html">this link</a> in Chrome,
and put the cursor in the beginning of the second or third cell and start
backspacing.  Note that the issue does not happen when the cell is empty.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-nonemptycelldelete">bugfix/nonemptycelldelete</a> (Shezan Baig)</h3>
<p>Note: This branch has been miscategorized as a bugfix, it is actually a
feature that we wanted specifically for our product, so it is unlikely that we
will send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch makes it so that hitting <code>&lt;delete&gt;</code> when the
cursor is at the end of a table cell will be a no-op.  The default behavior in
WebKit is to move into the next cell and start deleting from there.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/nonemptycelldelete.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
put the cursor at the end of the first cell, after the 'c' and start deleting.
The table in the next cell will be highlighted on the first press, and deleted
on the second press.  Note that the issue does not happen when the cell is
empty.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-outdentWithBR">bugfix/outdentWithBR</a> (Shezan Baig; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92130">92130</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/outdentWithBR.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
indented block will be highlighted on load.  Click on the <code>OUTDENT</code>
button.  There are now a bunch of empty lines added in between.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-pasteUsesLineBreak">bugfix/pasteUsesLineBreak</a> (Shezan Baig; D33830147)</h3>

<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-removeMarkersUponEditing">bugfix/removeMarkersUponEditing</a> (Edward Christie)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-removeApostropheMarker">bugfix/removeApostropheMarker</a> (Tianyin Zhang; D38435539)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/removeApostropheMarker.html">this link</a> in test_shell and type the word "shouldn't" in the DIV[contenteditable]. Then backspace to remove the character 't', and then hit 'space'. Note that the red squiggly is displayed under "shouldn'".  Now hit 'backspace', 't' and then 'space'.  Note that the red squiggly does not go away. This bug happens when AsynchronousSpellCheckEnabled is off. </p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-removeSpellingMarker">bugfix/removeSpellingMarker</a> (Tianyin Zhang; D38695085;)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/removeSpellingMarker.html">this link</a> in chrome, place the cursor inside the contenteditable and make sure some mispelling markers show up. Then click on the button to switch the contenteditable to false. Note that the misspelling markers aren't removed. </p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-restoreCaretPosition">bugfix/restoreCaretPosition</a> (Tianyin Zhang; D38277785)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/restoreCaretPosition.html">this link</a> in test_shell. Enable AsynchronousSpellCheckEnabled bit, Spellchecker, and AutoCorrection. Assuming the Spellchecker will autocorrect all the 'tst' into 'test'. Now type really fast in the DIV[contenteditable] below. Make sure 'tsts' is typed multiple times.  Note that the caret position should always be at the end of this text flow.  Due to a bug in Editor, this could break when user types fast because it would reset the caret position after a replacement under some cases.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-scrollClipRect">bugfix/scrollClipRect</a> (Shezan Baig; D32861389)</h3>
<p>This bug is somewhat hard to reproduce, the window size needs to be just
about right.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/scrollClipRect.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
resize the window so that new outer scrollbars appear over the existing
scrollbars of the iframe.  Then resize it just a little smaller.  Then use the
mouse wheel to scroll the contents of the iframe.</p>
<p>If the window is sized just right, you will see that only a portion of the
iframe scrolls.  This is because the clipRect is not being calculated correctly
due to the scale transform being applied.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-selectionGapTransform">bugfix/selectionGapTransform</a> (Shezan Baig)</h3>
<p>This bug is a little hard to reproduce programatically, so you may need to
play around with selection after the file has loaded.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/selectionGapTransform.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
The selection will be modified by script.  Once it settles, the selected range
should start at "tempus" on the second line, and end at "Vestibulim" on the
fourth line.  However, there are gaps in the selection being highlighted
outside this range.</p>
<p>If this is not reproduced on document load, try play around with selection.
For example, use the mouse to select from the first line of text to the last
line of text, then move the mouse back to unselect.  While playing with it, at
some points you will notice that the selection highlights are not properly
being removed when unselecting, and sometimes the selection highlights don't
properly appear at the right time.</p>
<p>This is because the code that fills the gaps between elements does not
handle transforms properly.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-selrectantialias">bugfix/selrectantialias</a> (Shezan Baig; D32113976; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=87157">87157</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/selrectantialias.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  You
will see "gaps" between the lines and the spans on the first line.</p>
<p>The issue is that the selection highlight is drawn for each text run with
anti-aliasing on.  This causes "gaps" to appear around the edges where the
filled rects got blended.  The solution was to simply turn off anti-aliasing
when filling selection rects.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-simplifiedIteratorFix">bugfix/simplifiedIteratorFix</a> (Edward Christie)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-singleCellDelete">bugfix/singleCellDelete</a> (Shezan Baig; D37576223)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/singleCellDelete.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
delete the text in the single table cell.  The entire table will get deleted,
but we only expect the text inside the cell to be deleted.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-svgscale">bugfix/svgscale</a> (Shezan Baig; D32353761; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85335">85335</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/svgscale.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  When a SVG
file is used as a css background, or in an <code>img</code> element, it does
not scale properly.  It only scales properly when used in an <code>embed</code>
element.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-tooltip_refresh">bugfix/tooltip_refresh</a> (Shezan Baig; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=84375">84375</a>)</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/tooltip_refresh.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  Each
line has a tooltip set.  However, when the first tooltip shows up, and you move
the mouse away from it, it doesn't move the tooltip to the element where the
mouse is.</p>

<h3><a name="bugfix-unifiedTextChecking">bugfix/unifiedTextChecking</a> (Edward Christie)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="feature-after_copycut">feature/after_copycut</a> (James McIlhargey)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch fires two new events <code>aftercut</code> and
<code>aftercopy</code> which have read/write access to the clipboard
representation.  This allows us to intercept the state of the clipboard after
WebKit has populated it and make any tweaks.  This is useful for selectively
overriding some copy/paste behaviour with minimal JS code.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-allowImageLoadCancel">feature/allowImageLoadCancel</a> (Alex Buch; D32427286)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="feature-can_supply_proxy_service">feature/can_supply_proxy_service</a> (Angelos Evripiotis)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>We needed extra control over the proxy server configuration that's used by
the <code>SimpleResourceLoaderBridge</code>.  This branch makes it possible to
supply a custom <code>net::ProxyConfigService</code> so we can provide our own
settings</p>

<h3><a name="feature-colorDocumentMarkers">feature/colorDocumentMarkers</a> (Shezan Baig; D32415776)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>We needed extra control of the color of the document markers (i.e. the
squiggly lines for spelling errors etc).  WebKit hardcodes spelling errors to
red, grammar errors to green.  This branch makes it possible for us to specify
the color from the document.</p>
<p>TODO: make this a CSS property instead of a DOM attribute.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-expose-request-context">feature/expose-request-context</a> (Imran Haider)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>We needed support for listing/reading/writing on the local filesystem.  For
the local filesystem writer, we need a reference to the blob storage controller
so that we can get the blob data.  A reference to the blob storage controller
can be retrieved from the <code>TestShellRequestContext</code>.  This commit
makes it possible for us to get a reference to the
<code>TestShellRequestContext</code> from the
<code>SimpleResourceLoaderBridge</code>.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-indentOutdentBB">feature/indentOutdentBB</a> (Shezan Baig; D36805707, D32177325)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch adds <code>IndentBB</code> and <code>OutdentBB</code> commands
that make indenting and outdenting of list items behave closer to how it works
in MS Word.</p>
<p>TODO: The code for this is very messy, it needs to be cleaned up.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-insertHTMLNested">feature/insertHTMLNested</a> (Shezan Baig; D37136356)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>We needed to modify the behavior of the <code>InsertHTML</code> command.
The WebKit behavior is to prevent the inserted HTML from being nested inside
style spans.  This branch adds <code>InsertHTMLNested</code> command that
allows the HTML to be nested inside style spans.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-instrumentLayout">feature/instrumentLayout</a> (Inseob Lee; D35009812)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="feature-instrumentRefCountedLeakCounter">feature/instrumentRefCountedLeakCounter</a> (Imran Haider)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="feature-line-erase">feature/line-erase</a> (Imran Haider)</h3>
<p>This bugfix addresses an issue when rendering:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div contenteditable="true"&gt;aaaa&lt;div&gt;bbcc&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<p>when the width of the browser is such that the "aaaa" takes up the whole
line.  Selecting and copying "aaaa" inbetween "bb" and "cc" will cause the "cc"
to disappear.</p>
<p>The disappearance of "cc" is caused by a invalid memory access and may
possibly lead to memory corruption.  The root cause of the problem is that the
new-line character after the source content is assumed to take some space (4
pixels) when it in fact doesn't take any space since it's at the end of the
line.  This miscalculation causes the final midpoint to not be placed and so
makes it impossible to compute the trailing whitespace string.</p>
<p>The missing trailing whitespace string causes the midpoint to not be placed
between the pasted content and the new-line character.  Since the new-line
character is part of the paragraph instead of being a separate node, the
new-line is never removed by <code>removeUnrenderedTextNodesAtEnds()</code>.
This causes the <code>endOfParagraph()</code> to return a reference to the
new-line character instead of the actual end of the pasted content.  At a later
point, <code>ReplaceSelectionCommand::mergeEndIfNeeded</code> makes an
assuption that there is a character after the end of paragraph, which is an
invalid assumption now.  This leads to an invalid memory access and sometimes
causes some nodes to disappear.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-listMarkerEnhancements">feature/listMarkerEnhancements</a> (Shezan Baig; D37088493; D32534047; D32422051; upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=21709">21709</a>)</h3>
<p>This branch makes a bunch of enhancements to list markers that were needed
in our product, so it is unlikely that many of them will be sent upstream.</p>
<p>The following changes are included in this branch:
<ul>
    <li><b>Fixed alignment for list markers</b><br/>
    Open <a href="repros/listMarkerAlignment.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
    The  list markers are all left-aligned, even though the second and third
    <code>li</code> elements are not.  This particular change may be able to
    upstream because there is already a WebKit bug report for it.
    </li>
    <li><b>The font used for the list marker will be the same as the first
        character in the list item.</b><br/>
    Open <a href="repros/listMarkerFont.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
    list item will be selected.  When you click <code>BIGGER</code> or
    <code>SMALLER</code> to change the font size, the list marker's font does
    not change with it.  In our product, we wanted the list marker's font to
    match the first character in the list item.
    </li>
    <li><b>The list markers are not highlighted when the list item is
        selected</b><br/>
    This matches the behavior in Firefox and Microsoft Word software.<br/>
    Open <a href="repros/listMarkerSelection.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
    Notice that the list markers are highlighted.  Additionally, notice that
    the list marker highlight does not honor the <code>::selection</code>
    background color specified in the stylesheet.  In our product, we didn't
    want the list markers to be highlighted when selected.
    </li>
    <li><b>Change layout of list items and list markers</b><br/>
    The way list elements and list items are laid out has been changed so that,
    instead of <code>OL</code>/<code>UL</code> elements having 40px padding,
    the <code>LI</code> elements will receive an additional (intrinsic) margin
    equivalent to the width of the list marker.  This matches more closely what
    other software like Microsoft Word does, and also prevents issues like
    <a href="repros/listMarkerEnhancements1.html">this link</a> where the list
    marker gets pushed outside the page.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="feature-nColumnSpan">feature/nColumnSpan</a> (Shezan Baig; D33399541, D36821222)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>When using the multicolumn feature, there is a way to make an element span
across all columns (<code>-webkit-column-span: all</code>).</p>
<p>However, we needed a way to span across a specified number of columns, (e.g.
<code>-webkit-column-span: 2</code>).  Once CSS Regions have matured (WebKit
bug <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=57312">57312</a>), we
should be able to use Regions to achieve this effect, then we can get rid of
this branch.  However, we needed this one specific feature immediately, so this
branch just hacks it in.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-noV8RecursionScopeCheck">feature/noV8RecursionScopeCheck</a> (Shezan Baig; D34552506)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch makes it so that we don't need to use the
<code>MicrotaskSuppression</code> guard whenever our product invokes
Javascript.  Our product uses V8 for non-WebKit related code.  Having to use
the <code>MicrotaskSuppression</code> guard would introduce WebKit dependency
on our non-WebKit related code.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-opaque-bmp">feature/opaque-bmp</a> (Imran Haider)</h3>
<p>This bugfix addresses a misinterpretation of the 4th byte of a 32-bit
uncompressed BMP image with a v1 header.  As per the <a
    href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd183376%28VS.85%29.aspx">specification</a>,
"The high byte in each DWORD is not used".  Prior to this change, this byte was
assumed to be unused if its value remained unchanged but interprets it as the
alpha channel if its value changes throughout the image data.  This fallback
behavior may cause problem for some users if the BMP image was created by an
encoder that copied uninitialize values into the 4th byte of every pixel.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-preserveSelDirection">feature/preserveSelDirection</a> (Shezan Baig; D36076457)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch makes it so that when text is selected inside a contenteditable,
and then a style is applied on that text, the original selection direction
would be preserved.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-printMenu">feature/printMenu</a> (Shezan Baig)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch adds a print menu to <code>test_shell</code>, so that it can be
used to test bugs like <code><a
        href="#bugfix-printBkTransparent">bugfix/printBkTransparent</a></code>
and <code><a href="#bugfix-printTextTop">bugfix/printTextTop</a></code>.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-resetCachedGDISettings">feature/resetCachedGDISettings</a> (Shezan Baig; D31921707, upstream: <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86891">86891</a>)</h3>
<p>Skia caches GDI settings like ClearType, so when these settings change (for
example, after remoting to a different machine, or manually changing it in the
system settings), the app does not pick up the new setting.</p>
<p>This branch adds a way to reset this cache.  There is also an upstream
ticket, however, this is not so much of an issue for Chrome because Chrome just
creates new processes for each tab, so it picks up the new setting that
way.</p>
<p>This branch also adds a way to set these flags externally, because our
product has an option to bypass the system default setting.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-tableEditing">feature/tableEditing</a> (Shezan Baig; D37611655)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="feature-timeline-on-startup">feature/timeline-on-startup</a> (Imran Haider)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>We needed a way to start up the inspector and the timeline before loading
the main document.  This change allows us to get a notification when the
<code>devtools.js</code> has completed processing a batch of messages.  The
first notification tells us that the inspector has processed all of the
initialization messages and so we can continue to inject JS to kick start the
timeline and to start loading the main document.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-v8dll">feature/v8dll</a> (Shezan Baig)</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This is just a small change to use V8 in a separate DLL.</p>

<h3><a name="feature-virtualAllocHooks">feature/virtualAllocHooks</a> (Lilit Darbinyan)</h3>
<p>TODO</p>

<h3><a name="feature-expose-pump-window">feature/expose-pump-window</a> (Imran Haider)</h3>
<p>This change adds a few public functions to allow an application to
use Chromium's pump window without having to modify the existing
main event loop of the application.</p>
