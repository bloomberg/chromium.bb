<h2>Branches</h2>
<p>This section will describe each branch and what changes they introduce.
Note that some of these changes have been contributed upstream.  Our intention
is to contribute as many changes upstream as possible so that we do not have to
maintain these branches in our repository.</p>
<p>However, we realize that some of these changes are made in order to adjust
the behavior of our own product, and may not be desirable/applicable to the
general web.  For example, the way the
<code>&lt;delete&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;backspace&gt;</code> keys work inside
table cells, the way indenting/outdenting of list items work, etc.  Therefore,
we will probably not be able to send <em>everything</em> upstream.</p>

<p>Open <a href="repros/anonymousPseudoStyle.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
The selection gaps after "hello" and "world" do not honor the selection
background color specified in the CSS.</p>

</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/badquerycommand.html">this link</a> in Chrome, click
the yellow div and hit <code>&lt;enter&gt;</code> a bunch of times. Then
<code>&lt;shift&gt;</code>+<code>&lt;up&gt;</code> a bunch of times. Each time
you press <code>&lt;up&gt;</code>, the result of

    <span class="viewchanges">[<a href="http://github.com/bloomberg/chromium.bb/compare/upstream%2Fpatched%2Flatest...bugfix%2FcaretPositionForInlineChildren">view changes</a>]</span>
</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/caretPositionForInlineChildren.html">this link</a> in
Chrome.  The "pill" elements have <code>-webkit-user-modify: read-only</code>,
however, the caret still gets rendered within the pills.  But when the user
types, the text (correctly) gets inserted outside the pills.  Also, the caret
is rendered outside the contenteditable div if there is no text after the
pills.</p>

<h3>
    <a name="bugfix-cleartypecanvas">bugfix/cleartypecanvas</a>

    <span class="viewchanges">[<a href="http://github.com/bloomberg/chromium.bb/compare/upstream%2Fpatched%2Flatest...bugfix%2Fcleartypecanvas">view changes</a>]</span>
</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/cleartypecanvas">this link</a> in Chrome, and notice
that the canvas element does not use ClearType fonts even though
<code>subpixel-antialiased</code> is used.</p> <p>Note that when painting to an
<code>ImageBuffer</code>, Chromium disables ClearType even if it is the default
on the system.  However, in our case, we are explicitly requesting it in the
document, so this change makes Chromium honor the
<code>-webkit-font-smoothing</code> setting if it is requested explicitly.</p>
<p>Note that there are two distinct changes introduced by this branch:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>-webkit-font-smoothing</code> setting has no effect in Windows for Skia.
This is the change that is being tracked upstream by WebKit bug
<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86776">86776</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't disable ClearType on <code>ImageBuffer</code> if it was explicitly requested.
This is not yet being tracked upstream.</p></li>
</ul>

    <a name="bugfix-cursorContext">bugfix/cursorContext</a>
    (Shezan Baig; D35952365)
    <span class="viewchanges">[<a href="http://github.com/bloomberg/chromium.bb/compare/upstream%2Fpatched%2Flatest...bugfix%2FcursorContext">view changes</a>]</span>
</h3>
<p>It is somewhat hard to reproduce, the window height needs to be just about
right.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/cursorContext.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and hit
Enter until the cursor is at the last possible line where the scrollbar does
not appear.  Make sure there is just enough space for about half a line
more.</p>
<p>Now keep typing on this line, letting it word-wrap which causes the scrollbar
to appear.  Keep doing this for a few lines.  You will notice that on some
lines (usually the second or the third, then every alternating line after
that), the scrollbar does not scroll down completely.</p>
<p>In our product, there is an overlay around the RTE of about a couple of pixels.
The purpose of the padding on the contenteditable was to prevent this overlay
from covering the text.  However, since the bottom of the text was right
against the border of the <code>content-editable</code>, this was causing the
descent of some characters to be obscured.</p>
<p>We "fixed" this in this branch by inflating the reveal rect by about half the
cursor height, showing more "context" when moving up and down in a scrollable
contenteditable.  However, a proper fix would be to make the last line scroll
completely, taking the padding into account.  We haven't gotten around to this
yet.</p>

<p>This branch consists of multiple fixes that were merged together:</p>
<ul><li><b>backspaceIntoTable (D32947240)</b><br>
    Open <a href="repros/backspaceIntoTable.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
    put the cursor between 'T' and 'e' in "Testing", and hit backspace twice.  The
    rest of the text will go into the last cell.
    </li>
    <li><b>backspaceOutOfLIInCell (D38514960)</b><br>
    Open <a href="repros/backspaceOutOfLIInCell.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
    try to backspace out of the list-item inside the table cell.
    </li>
    <li><b>nonemptycellbackspace</b><br>
    Open <a href="repros/nonemptycellbackspace.html">this link</a> in Chrome,
    and put the cursor in the beginning of the second or third cell and start
    backspacing.  Note that the issue does not happen when the cell is
    empty.<br>
    <i>Note that this has been fixed upstream since the
    <code>28.0.1500.95</code> snapshot.</i>
    </li>
    <li><b>nonemptycelldelete</b><br>
    Open <a href="repros/nonemptycelldelete.html">this link</a> in Chrome, and
    put the cursor at the end of the first cell, after the 'c' and start deleting.
    The table in the next cell will be highlighted on the first press, and deleted
    on the second press.  Note that the issue does not happen when the cell is
    empty.<br>

and third list items will be selected.  Click on the <code>OL</code> button to
convert these items to an ordered list.  The second and third list items get
placed into separate lists, but they should be on the same list.  Note that
this doesn't happen if the first and second items are selected instead.</p>

<p>Open <a href="repros/mouseLeaveOverlappingWindow.html">this link</a> in
Chrome.  Then drag another window so that it partially overlaps the green box.
Move the mouse over to the green box, it will turn red.  Now move the mouse to

</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/noBRAtStartOfPara.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
contents of the table will be selected on load.  Hit the "List" button multiple
times.  Each click executes the <code>insertOrderedList</code> command.</p>

</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/overflowFind.html">this link</a> in Chrome and search
for the string "text".  The text will scroll and the "hidden" search result

</h3>
<p>Open <a href="repros/selrectantialias.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  You
will see "gaps" between the lines and the spans on the first line.</p>
<p>The issue is that the selection highlight is drawn for each text run with
anti-aliasing on.  This causes "gaps" to appear around the edges where the
filled rects got blended.  The solution was to simply turn off anti-aliasing
when filling selection rects.</p>

<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>In previous versions of WebKit, specifying "font-family: Foo Bold" would
automatically pick the bold version of the font "Foo", even when font-weight
was not set.  Unfortunately, we have content out there that took advantage of
this, and now we need to support that behavior forever.</p>

red, grammar errors to green.  This branch makes it possible for us to specify
the color from the document.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/colorDocumentMarkers.html">this link</a> in Chrome.

<p>This is a complete reimplementation of the "Indent" and "Outdent" algorithm,
called "IndentBlock" and "OutdentBlock".  Instead of cloning paragraphs, and
deleting the old paragraphs, this algorithm just moves blocks in and out of
blockquotes.  Also, it operates on blocks of text, instead of paragraphs.  This
is similar to how MSWord works.</p>

<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will

<p>We needed to modify the behavior of the <code>InsertHTML</code> command.
The WebKit behavior is to prevent the inserted HTML from being nested inside

allows the HTML to be nested inside style spans.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/insertHTMLNested.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  With
this patch, the "Insert HTML Nested" button works to preserve the font setting.
The default "Insert HTML" button doesn't preserve it.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/insertHTMLNested2.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
word "hello" will be highlighted.  Now press "Insert HTML".  The "hello" text
will be replaced with a link.  However, we lose one newline between "hello" and
"world".  With this patch, the "Insert HTML Nested" button does the same thing,
except that the newlines are preserved.</p>

</h3>
<p>This branch makes a bunch of enhancements to list markers that were needed
in our product, so it is unlikely that many of them will be sent upstream.</p>
<p>The following changes are included in this branch:
<ul>
    <li><b>Fixed alignment for list markers</b><br/>
    Open <a href="repros/listMarkerAlignment.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
    The  list markers are all left-aligned, even though the second and third
    <code>li</code> elements are not.  This particular change may be able to
    upstream because there is already a WebKit bug report for it.
    </li>
    <li><b>The font used for the list marker will be the same as the first
        character in the list item.</b><br/>
    Open <a href="repros/listMarkerFont.html">this link</a> in Chrome.  The
    list item will be selected.  When you click <code>BIGGER</code> or
    <code>SMALLER</code> to change the font size, the list marker's font does
    not change with it.  In our product, we wanted the list marker's font to
    match the first character in the list item.
    </li>
    <li><b>The list markers are not highlighted when the list item is
        selected</b><br/>
    This matches the behavior in Firefox and Microsoft Word software.<br/>
    Open <a href="repros/listMarkerSelection.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
    Notice that the list markers are highlighted.  Additionally, notice that
    the list marker highlight does not honor the <code>::selection</code>
    background color specified in the stylesheet.  In our product, we didn't
    want the list markers to be highlighted when selected.
    </li>
    <li><b>Change layout of list items and list markers</b><br/>
    The way list elements and list items are laid out has been changed so that,
    instead of <code>OL</code>/<code>UL</code> elements having 40px padding,
    the <code>LI</code> elements will receive an additional (intrinsic) margin
    equivalent to the width of the list marker.  This matches more closely what
    other software like Microsoft Word does, and also prevents issues like
    <a href="repros/listMarkerEnhancements1.html">this link</a> where the list
    marker gets pushed outside the page.
    </li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>This branch makes it so that when text is selected inside a contenteditable,
and then a style is applied on that text, the original selection direction
would be preserved.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/preserveSelDirection.html">this link</a> in Chrome.
With this patch applied, the anchor offset would be 5 positions higher than the
focus offset.  Without the patch, the anchor offset and focus offset will be
switched.</p>

</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>By default, Chrome shows a black underline while composing in IME mode.
This is a problem if the background is also black.  This branch removes the
color property from the <code>CompositionUnderline</code> object, and makes
<code>InlineTextBox</code> use the text foreground color instead.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/removeIMEUnderlineColor.html">this link</a> in Chrome
and type in Japanese.  Without this patch, the underline color will be black,
but it will be yellow once the patch is applied.</p>

</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>There are situations where we want to update a span, and because we know the
span is of a fixed size, we don't want the new text to trigger a relayout.  For
this, we introduced a new method on text nodes "bbSetDataNoRelayout".</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/setDataNoRelayout.html">this link</a> in Chrome (may
take a while to finish loading).  With this patch applied, there will be a
noticable difference in the time taken to execute the button click, depending
on whether the "norelayout" checkbox is enabled or disabled.</p>

    (Shezan Baig; D37611655)
    <span class="viewchanges">[<a href="http://github.com/bloomberg/chromium.bb/compare/upstream%2Fpatched%2Flatest...feature%2FtableEditing">view changes</a>]</span>
</h3>
<p>This is a feature we needed in our product, so it is unlikely that we will
send this upstream.</p>
<p>Right now, this branch consists of changes to the way text highlighting
works.  In upstream Chrome, the left and right side of text are highlighted
when the selection extends to the previous and next lines.  These are the
"selection gaps" that WebKit tries to highlight.</p>
<p>For our product, we just want the text to be highlighted.  So we disable the
left and right selection gaps.  However, we maintain the top and bottom
selection gaps (fixing a few bugs along the way).  We also maintain a slight
selection gap at the end of the lines in editable text, to indicate that the
line-ending has been selected.</p>
<p>However, for tables, we do highlight the left and right sides if the
selection extends outside the table cell.</p>
<p>Open <a href="repros/tableEditing.html">this link</a> and compare the
behavior with and without the patch applied.</p>
