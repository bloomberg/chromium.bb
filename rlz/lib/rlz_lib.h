// Segment RLZ persistence based on branding information.
// All information for a given product is persisted under keys with the either

// product brand is associated with it.

// information must be kept separately for each of these brands.  To achieve
// this segmentation, scope all RLZ library calls that deal with supplementary
// brands within the lifetime of an rlz_lib::ProductBranding instance.
//
// For example, to record events for a supplementary brand, do the following:
//
//  {
//    rlz_lib::SupplementaryBranding branding("AAAA");
//    // This call to RecordProductEvent is scoped to the AAAA brand.

// In particular, this affects the recording of stateful events and the sending
// of financial pings.  In the former case, a stateful event recorded while
// scoped to a supplementary brand will be recorded again when scoped to a
// different supplementary brand (or not scoped at all).  In the latter case,
