This is a test plugin for manual testing of the Pepper plugin API. See
  https://wiki.mozilla.org/Plugins:PlatformIndependentNPAPI

Open the Chrome all.sln solution and rebuild the pepper_test_plugin and
chrome projects.

To load this plugin in Chrome, use the command line flags:
  --no-sandbox
  --internal-pepper
  --load-plugin=<<<YOUR CHECKOUT ROOT>>\src\webkit\tools\pepper_test_plugin\Debug\pepper_test_plugin.dll
  
A simple way to launch Chrome with these command line flags is to run the
generated pepper_test_plugin project.

Note that pepper_test_plugin is not dependent on the chrome project so you
need to remember to build Chrome separately if necessary.

- Mac Instructions -
In the pepper_test_plugin.xcodeproj that gets generated in this dir by GYP:

[There isn't a way to add an Xcode Custom Executable via GYP, so you have to do
this by hand each time the .xcoeproj is generated.  Sorry.]

Right (ctrl)-click 'Executables', then "Add -> New Custom Executable..."
Call the Executable "Chromium"
Set the Executable Path to ${BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR}/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium
When the Info panel comes up, add these arguments using the '+' button:
	--no-sandbox
	--internal-pepper
	file://${SRCROOT}/test_page.html
	# Add this if you want Chromium to pause before loading a render view.
	--renderer-startup-dialog
	# Add this to run Chromium as a single process.
	--single-process

Before you run the executable, copy the plugin into the Chromium.app bundle,
into Chromium.app/Contents/PlugIns.  You might have to create the PlugIns
directory first.

Once all this is set up, you can use "Build and run" (or cmd-r) in Xcode to
run the pepper plugin test.
