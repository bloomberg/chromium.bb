// This file consists of lines with specifications of what

// LayoutTests/fast/js/crash.js = CRASH TIMEOUT FAIL PASS

// BUG[0-9]+: See this bug for more information. Every test that isn't marked
//            WONTFIX should have a BUG annotation.
// SKIP: Doesn't run the test.
// SLOW: The test takes a long time to run, but does not timeout indefinitely.
// WONTFIX: For tests that we never intend to pass on a given platform.
// DEBUG: Expectations apply only to the debug build.
// RELEASE: Expectations apply only to release build.
// LINUX/WIN/MAC: Expectations apply only to these platforms.
//
// The format of a test line is as follows:
// METADATA : relative/path/to/test.html = EXPECTATIONS
//
// For example,
