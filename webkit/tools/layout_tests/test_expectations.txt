// This file should almost always be empty. Normally Chromium test expectations
// are only put here temporarily, and moved to
// src/third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests/platform/chromium/test_expectations.txt
// where they will remain until they are rebaselined.
//
//
// If you are landing a Chromium CL that would break webkit layout tests,
// please follow these steps:
//
// 1. Add expected failures to the bottom of this file, and run your CL through
// various *_layout trybots.  Confirm that the trybot results are green (any
// failures are masked by the expectations you added to this file).
//
// 2. BEFORE landing your Chromium CL, land a WebKit CL adding those same
// expected failures to
// src/third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests/platform/chromium/test_expectations.txt .
//
// 3. AFTER you have landed the WebKit test_expectations CL, you can land your
// Chromium CL.  Be sure to include your expected failures in this file, so
// that other tip-of-tree Chromium developers will not be disturbed by your
// change.
//
//
// Every time Chromium's "WebKit Gardener" rolls the WebKit DEPS within
// Chromium, he will delete ALL expectations within this file.  (By then, they
// will be redundant, because you already landed those same expectations in
// src/third_party/WebKit/LayoutTests/platform/chromium/test_expectations.txt .
// Right?)
//
// EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE WILL BE DELETED AT EVERY WEBKIT DEPS ROLL
