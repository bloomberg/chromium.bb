  <p>The Input Events example shows how to handle input events in a
     multi-threaded application.  The main thread converts input events to
     non-pepper events and puts them on a queue. The worker thread pulls them
     off of the queue, converts them to a string, and then uses
     CallOnMainThread so that PostMessage can be send the result of the worker
     thread to the browser.</p>
  <p>If you press the 'Kill worker thread and queue' button, then the main
  thread (which puts events on the queue) will call CancelQueue, indicating
  that the main thread will no longer put events on the queue.  When the worker
  sees that the shared queue has been cancelled, the worker thread will
  terminate.</p>
