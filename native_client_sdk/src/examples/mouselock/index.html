  <h1>Full-screen and Mouse-lock Example</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>There are two different kinds of fullscreen mode: "tab fullscreen" and
        "browser fullscreen".
      <ul>
        <li>Tab fullscreen refers to when a tab enters fullscreen mode via the
            JS or Pepper fullscreen API.</li>
        <li>Browser fullscreen refers to the user putting the browser itself
            into fullscreen mode from the UI (e.g., pressing F11).</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight:bold">
        NOTE: Mouse lock is only allowed in "tab fullscreen" mode.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>Lock mouse:
      <ul>
        <li>left click in the grey box; or</li>
        <li>right click in the box to ensure that it is focused and
            then press Enter key. (You could verify that the tooltip window is
            dismissed properly by this second approach.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Unlock mouse voluntarily (i.e., NaCl module unlocks mouse):
      <ul>
        <li>press Enter.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Unlock mouse involuntarily (i.e. Chrome unlocks mouse):
      <ul>
        <li>lose focus; or</li>
        <li>press Esc key; or</li>
        <li>exit from the "tab fullscreen" mode.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Clicking the mouse inside the grey square takes the NaCl module to/from
  combined fullscreen and mouselock mode.</p>
  <p>While in fullscreen, pressing Enter will exit/enter mouse lock mode.</p>

  <!-- The <EMBED> element is wrapped inside a <DIV>, which has both a 'load'
  and a 'message' event listener attached.  This wrapping method is used
  instead of attaching the event listeners directly to the <EMBED> element to
  ensure that the listeners are active before the NaCl module 'load' event
  fires.  This also allows you to use PPB_Messaging.PostMessage() (in C) or
  pp::Instance.PostMessage() (in C++) from within the initialization code in
  your NaCl module. 
  
  The src points to a manifest file, which provides the Native Client plug-in
  a mapping between architecture and NaCl Executable (NEXE). 
  
  We use a non-zero sized embed to give Chrome space to place the bad plug-in
  graphic, if there is a problem.
