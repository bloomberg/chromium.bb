<h2>Native Client Examples</h2>
<p>This page lists all of the examples available in the most recent Native Client SDK bundle. Each example is designed to teach a few specific Native Client programming concepts.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="hello_world_c/hello_world_c.html">Hello World in C</a></dt>
  <dd>The Hello World In C example demonstrates the basic structure of all Native Client applications. This example loads a Native Client module and responds to button click events by showing alert panels.

    <p>Teaching focus: Basic HTML, JavaScript, and module architecture; Messaging API.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="hello_world/hello_world.html">Hello World in C++</a></dt>
  <dd>The Hello World C++ example demonstrates the basic structure of all Native Client applications. This example loads a Native Client module and responds to button click events by showing alert panels.

		<p>Teaching focus: Basic HTML, JavaScript, and module architecture; Messaging API.</p>
  </dd>
<dt><a href="load_progress/load_progress.html">Load Progress</a></dt>
  <dd>	The Load Progress example demonstrates how to listen for and handle events that occur while a
		NaCl module loads.  This example listens for different load event types and dispatches different events to their respective handler. This example also checks for valid browser
		version and shows how to calculate and display loading progress.

		<p>Teaching focus: Progress event handling.</p>
  </dd>
 <dt><a href="pi_generator/pi_generator.html">Pi Generator</a></dt>
  <dd>	The Pi Generator example demonstrates creating a helper thread that estimate pi using the Monte Carlo
      method while randomly putting 1,000,000,000 points inside a 2D square that shares two
      sides with a quarter circle.

		<p>Teaching focus: Thread creation, 2D graphics, view change events.</p>
  </dd>
<dt><a href="input_events/input_events.html">Input Events</a></dt>
  <dd>	The Input Events example demonstrates how to handle events triggered by the user. This example allows a user
		to interact with a square representing a module instance. Events are displayed on the screen as the user clicks, scrolls, types, inside or outside
		of the square.

		<p>Teaching focus: Keyboard and mouse input, view change, and focus events.</p>
  </dd>
<dt><a href="sine_synth/sine_synth.html">Sine Wave Synthesizer</a></dt>
  <dd>	The Sine Wave Synthesizer example demonstrates playing sound (a sine wave).

		<p>Teaching focus: Audio.</p>
  </dd>
<dt><a href="pong/pong.html">Pong</a></dt>
  <dd>	The Pong example demonstrates how to create a basic 2D video game and how to store application
		information in a local persistent file. This game uses up and
    down arrow keyboard input events to move the paddle.

		<p>Teaching focus: File I/O, 2D graphics, input events.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="geturl/geturl.html">Get URL</a></dt>
  <dd>	The Get URL example demonstrates fetching an URL and then displaying its contents.

		<p>Teaching focus: URL loading.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="multithreaded_input_events/mt_input_events.html">Multi-threaded Input Events</a></dt>
  <dd>The Multithreaded Input Events example combines HTML, Javascript,
    and C++ (the C++ is compiled to create a .nexe file).
    The C++ shows how to handle input events in a multi-threaded application.
    The main thread converts input events to non-pepper events and puts them on
    a queue. The worker thread pulls them off of the queue, converts them to a
    string, and then uses CallOnMainThread so that PostMessage can be send the
    result of the worker thread to the browser.
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="tumbler/tumbler.html">Tumbler</a></dt>
  <dd>	The Tumbler example demonstrates how to create a 3D cube that you can rotate with your mouse while pressing the
 		left mouse button. This example creates a 3D context and draws to it using
      OpenGL ES. The JavaScript implements a virtual trackball interface to
      map mouse movements into 3D rotations using simple 3D vector math and
      quaternions.

		<p>Teaching focus: 3D graphics</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="fullscreen_tumbler/fullscreen_tumbler.html">Full-screen Tumbler</a></dt>
  <dd>	This is a modified version of the Tumbler example above that supports
        full-screen display. It is in every way identical to Tumbler in
        functionality, except that it adds the ability to switch to/from
        full-screen display by pressing the Enter key.

		<p>Teaching focus: Full-screen</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="mouselock/mouselock.html">Mouse Locker</a></dt>
  <dd>	The Mouselock example demonstrates how to use the MouseLock API to hide
  the mouse cursor.  Mouse lock is only available in full-screen mode.  You can
  lock and unlock the mouse while in full-screen mode by pressing the Enter key.

		<p>Teaching focus: Mouse lock, Full-screen</p>
