<p>To build Native Client modules, you must download and install the Native
Client Software Development Kit (SDK). This page provides an overview
of the Native Client SDK, and instructions for how to download and
install the SDK.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The Native Client SDK includes the following:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>support for multiple Pepper versions</dt>
<dd>The SDK contains <strong>bundles</strong> that let you compile Native Client modules
using different versions of the
<a class="reference internal" href="/native-client/overview.html#link-pepper"><em>Pepper Plugin API</em></a> (e.g., Pepper 31 or Pepper Canary). Review the
<a class="reference internal" href="/native-client/sdk/release-notes.html"><em>Release Notes</em></a> for a description of the new features
included in each Pepper version to help you decide which bundle to
use to develop your application. In general, Native Client modules
compiled using a particular Pepper version will work in
corresponding versions of Chrome and higher. For example, a module
compiled using the Pepper 31 bundle will work in Chrome 31 and
higher.</dd>
<dt>update utility</dt>
<dd>The <code>naclsdk</code> utility (<code>naclsdk.bat</code> on Windows) lets you download new
bundles that are available, as well as new versions of existing bundles.</dd>
<dt>toolchains</dt>
<dd>Each platform includes three toolchains: one for compiling
Portable Native Client (PNaCl) applications, one for compiling
architecture-specific Native Client applications with newlib, and
one for compiling architecture-specific Native Client applications with glibc.
Newlib and glibc are two different implementations
of the C standard library. All three toolchains contain
Native Client-compatible versions of standard compilers, linkers,
and other tools. See <a class="reference internal" href="/native-client/nacl-and-pnacl.html"><em>NaCl and PNaCl</em></a> to help
you choose the right toolchain.</dd>
<dt>examples</dt>
<dd>Each example in the SDK includes C or C++ source files and header files
illustrating how to use NaCl and Pepper, along with a Makefile to build
the example using each of the toolchains.</dd>
<dt>tools</dt>
<dd>The SDK includes a number of additional tools that you can use for
tasks such as validating Native Client modules and running modules
from the command line.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Follow the steps below to download and install the Native Client SDK.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Python:</strong> Make sure you have Python 2.6 or 2.7 installed, and that the
Python executable is in your path.</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>On Mac/Linux, Python is likely preinstalled. Run the command <code>&quot;python
-V</code>&#8221; in a terminal window, and make sure that the version of Python you
have is 2.6.x or 2.7.x (if it&#8217;s not, upgrade to one of those versions).</li>
<li>On Windows, you may need to install Python. Go to
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.python.org/download/">http://www.python.org/download/</a> and
select the latest 2.x version. In addition, be sure to add the Python
directory (for example, <code>C:\python27</code>) to the PATH <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable">environment
variable</a>. After
you&#8217;ve installed Python, run the command <code>&quot;python -V</code>&#8221; in a Command
Prompt window and verify that the version of Python you have is 2.6.x or
2.7.x.</li>
<li>Note that Python 3.x is not yet supported.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Make:</strong> On the Mac, you need to install the <code>make</code> command on your system
before you can build and run the examples in the SDK. One easy way to get
<code>make</code>, along with several other useful tools, is to install
<a class="reference external" href="https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/">Xcode Developer Tools</a>.
After installing Xcode, go to the Preferences menu, select
Downloads and Components, and verify that Command Line Tools are installed.
If you&#8217;d rather not install Xcode, you can download and build an
<a class="reference external" href="http://mac.softpedia.com/dyn-postdownload.php?p=44632&amp;t=4&amp;i=1">open source version</a> of
<code>make</code>. In order to build the command you may also need to download and
install a copy of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer">gcc</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="download-and-install-the-sdk">Download and install the SDK</h2>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Download the SDK update utility: <a class="reference external" href="http://storage.googleapis.com/nativeclient-mirror/nacl/nacl_sdk/nacl_sdk.zip">nacl_sdk.zip</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Unzip the SDK update utility:</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li><p class="first">On Mac/Linux, run the command &#8220;<code>unzip nacl_sdk.zip</code>&#8221; in a terminal
window.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">On Windows, right-click on the .zip file and select &#8220;Extract All...&#8221;. A
dialog box will open; enter a location and click &#8220;Extract&#8221;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unzipping the SDK update utility creates a directory called <code>nacl_sdk</code> with
the following files and directories:</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li><p class="first"><code>naclsdk</code> (and <code>naclsdk.bat</code> for Windows) &#8212; the front end of the update
utility, i.e., the command you run to download the latest bundles</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><code>sdk_cache</code> &#8212; a directory with a manifest file that lists the bundles
you have already downloaded</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><code>sdk_tools</code> &#8212; the back end of the update utility, also known as the
&#8220;sdk_tools&#8221; bundle</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To see the SDK bundles that are available for download, go to the <code>nacl_sdk</code>
directory and run <code>naclsdk</code> with the <code>&quot;list&quot;</code> command.
The SDK includes a separate bundle for each version of Chrome/Pepper.</p>
<p>On Mac/Linux:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ cd nacl_sdk
$ ./naclsdk list
</pre>
<p>On Windows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&gt; cd nacl_sdk
&gt; naclsdk list
</pre>
<p>You should see output similar to this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Bundles:
 I: installed
 *: update available

  I  sdk_tools (stable)
     vs_addin (dev)
     pepper_27 (post_stable)
     pepper_28 (post_stable)
     pepper_29 (post_stable)
     pepper_30 (post_stable)
     pepper_31 (stable)
     pepper_32 (beta)
     pepper_canary (canary)
</pre>
<p>The sample output above shows that there are a number of bundles available
for download, and that you have already installed the latest revision of the
<code>sdk_tools</code> bundle (it was included in the zip file you downloaded).
Each bundle is labeled post-stable, stable, beta, dev, or canary.
These labels usually correspond to the current versions of
Chrome. (In the example above, Chrome 31 is stable, Chrome 32 is beta, etc.).
We generally recommend that you download and use a &#8220;stable&#8221; bundle,
as applications developed with &#8220;stable&#8221; bundles can be used by all current
Chrome users. This is because Native Client is designed to be
backward-compatible (for example, applications developed with the
<code>pepper_31</code> bundle can run in Chrome 31, Chrome 32, etc.).
Thus in the example above, <code>pepper_31</code> is the recommended bundle to use.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Run <code>naclsdk</code> with the &#8220;update&#8221; command to download recommended bundles.</p>
<p>On Mac/Linux:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ ./naclsdk update
</pre>
<p>On Windows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&gt; naclsdk update
</pre>
<p>By default, <code>naclsdk</code> only downloads bundles that are
recommended&#8212;generally those that are &#8220;stable.&#8221; Continuing with the earlier example, the
&#8220;update&#8221; command would only download the <code>pepper_31</code>
bundle, since the bundles <code>pepper_32</code> and greater are not yet stable.
If you want the <code>pepper_32</code> bundle, you must ask for it explicitly:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ ./naclsdk update pepper_32
</pre>
<p>Note that you never need to update the <code>sdk_tools</code> bundle&#8212;it is
updated automatically (if necessary) whenever you run <code>naclsdk</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<aside class="note">
The minimum SDK bundle that supports PNaCl is <code>pepper_31</code>.

<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Run <code>naclsdk</code> with the &#8220;list&#8221; command again; this will show you the list of
available bundles and verify which bundles you have installed.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ ./naclsdk list
</pre>
<p>On Windows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">

<p>Continuing with the earlier example, if you previously downloaded the
<code>pepper_31</code> bundle, you should see output similar to this:</p>

</li>
<li><p class="first">Running <code>naclsdk</code> with the &#8220;update&#8221; command again will verify that your

<pre class="prettyprint">
$ ./naclsdk update
</pre>
<p>On Windows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
&gt; naclsdk update
</pre>
<p>Continuing with the earlier example, you should see output similar to this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
pepper_31 is already up-to-date.
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">To check if there is a new version of a previously installed bundle, you can

     pepper_canary (canary)
</pre>
<p>An asterisk next to a bundle indicates that there is an update
available for that bundle. If you run  the &#8220;update&#8221; command now,
<code>naclsdk</code> will warn you with a message similar to this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
WARNING: pepper_31 already exists, but has an update available.
Run update with the --force option to overwrite the existing directory.
Warning: This will overwrite any modifications you have made within this directory.
</pre>
<p>To dowload the new version of a bundle and overwrite the existing directory
for that bundle, run <code>naclsdk</code> with the <code>--force</code> option.</p>
<p>On Mac/Linux:</p>
