<p>The Pepper 27 bundle features a significant number of new libraries that have
been incorporated directly into the SDK.</p>
<section id="libraries">
<h3 id="libraries">Libraries</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li><p class="first">A number of libraries from the naclports project have been incorporated
directly into the Native Client SDK. These libraries include:</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>image encoding/decoding: jpeg, tiff, png, webp</li>
<li>multimedia: openal, freealut, ogg, vorbis</li>
<li>XML parsing: tinyxml, xml2</li>
<li>miscellaneous: zlib (general purpose compression), freetype (font
rendering), lua (Lua interpreter)</li>
</ul>
<p>The libraries are located in <code>ports/lib</code>, and the header files are in
<code>ports/include</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>The <code>httpfs</code> filesystem in the nacl_io library now caches content in memory
by default; this improves performance considerably.</li>
<li>For applications compiled with a glibc toolchain, <code>dlopen()</code> can now be
used to open shared libraries that are not specified in an application&#8217;s
Native Client manifest (.nmf) file. This allows applications, for example, to
download a shared object and then use <code>dlopen()</code> to access the shared
object.  The <code>dlopen</code> example has been modified to demonstrate this
functionality: reverse.cc is built into a shared object (.so) file, which is
downloaded and opened using an <code>httpfs</code> mount.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="examples">
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>Each example now has a single <code>index.html</code> file, instead of multiple HTML
files corresponding to NaCl modules built using different toolchains and
configurations. By default, most examples are built using one toolchain
(newlib) and one configuration (Debug). If you build an example using
multiple toolchains or configurations, you can specify which version to run
in Chrome using the query parameters <code>tc</code> and <code>config</code>. For example,
assuming you are serving an example from the local server localhost:5103, you
can run a version of the example built with the glibc toolchain in the
Release configuration by specifying the following URL in Chrome:
<code>http://localhost:5103/index.html?tc=glibc&amp;config=Release</code>. For additional
information about how different NaCl modules are loaded into <code>index.html</code>,
see the <code>common.js</code> file in each example.</li>

To see the actual build commands, run <code>make V=1</code>.</li>
<li>By default, most examples are built using one toolchain (newlib) and one
configuration (Debug). To build an example using a different toolchain or
configuration, run <code>make</code> with the parameters <code>TOOLCHAIN=&lt;x&gt;</code> or
<code>CONFIG=&lt;y&gt;</code>.  You can also run make <code>all_versions</code> to build an example
with all toolchains.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Header files have been moved out of the toolchains. All toolchains now share
the same set of header files as host builds. Previously host and NaCl builds
used different headers, which could cause build problems.</li>

which provides a virtual file system that you can use with standard C file
operations, and ppapi_main, which lets you implement a Native Client module

<h3 id="id9">Build tools and toolchains</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li><p class="first">The SDK includes a new toolchain to build Native Client executables (.nexe

<ul class="small-gap">
<li>Currently the ARM toolchain can only be used to compile modules that use
the <a class="reference internal" href="/native-client/devguide/devcycle/dynamic-loading.html#c-libraries"><em>newlib C library</em></a>. You cannot use the ARM toolchain
to compile modules that use the glibc library.</li>
<li>The ARM toolchain is in the directory
<code>pepper_25/toolchain/&lt;host&gt;_arm_newlib</code>.  The bin subdirectory contains
the compiler (<code>arm-nacl-gcc</code>), the linker (<code>arm-nacl-g++</code>), and the
other tools in the toolchain.</li>
<li>Take a look at the <code>hello_world</code> example to see how to use the ARM
toolchain. Go to <code>examples/hello_world</code> and run <code>make</code>. When the build
finishes, the newlib/Debug and newlib/Release subdirectories will contain
.nexe files for the x86-32, x86-64, and ARM target architecutes, and a
Native Client manifest (.nmf file) that references those three .nexe files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The simple web server included in the SDK, <code>httpd.py</code>, has been moved from
the <code>examples/</code> directory to the <code>tools/</code> directory. On Windows, you can
run <code>httpd.cmd</code> (in the <code>examples/</code> directory) to start the server.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="ppapi">
<h3 id="ppapi">PPAPI</h3>
<p>Pepper 25 includes two new APIs:</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="/native-client/pepper_stable/c/struct_p_p_b___console__1__0">Console API</a> lets your
module log messages to the JavaScript console in the Chrome browser.</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="/native-client/pepper_stable/cpp/classpp_1_1_message_loop">MessageLoop</a> API lets your
module make PPAPI calls on a background thread.  Once you&#8217;ve created a
message loop resource, attached it to a thread, and run it, you can post work
to the thread, including completion callbacks for asynchronous operations.
For a C++ example of how to use the MessageLoop API, see
<code>pepper_25/include/ppapi/utility/threading/simple_thread.h</code>. Note that you
cannot make asynchronous PPAPI calls on a background thread without creating
and using a message loop.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="id10">
<h3 id="id10">Libraries</h3>
<p>The SDK includes two new libraries:</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li><p class="first">The <strong>nacl_mounts</strong> library provides a virtual file system that your module
can &#8220;mount&#8221; in a given directory tree. The file system can be one of several
types:</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>&#8220;memfs&#8221; is an in-memory file system,</li>
<li>&#8220;dev&#8221; is a file system with various utility nodes (e.g., <code>/dev/null</code>,
<code>/dev/console[0-3]</code>, <code>/dev/tty</code>), and</li>
<li>&#8220;html5fs&#8221; is a persistent file system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve mounted a file system in your module, you can use standard C
library file operations: fopen, fread, fwrite, fseek, and fclose. How those
operations are performed depends on the type of file system (e.g., for
html5fs, the operations are performed using the Pepper FileIO API). For a
list of the types of file systems you can mount, see
include/nacl_mounts/nacl_mounts.h. For an example of how to use nacl_mounts,
see examples/hello_nacl_mounts. Note that html5fs is subject to the same
constraints as persistent <a class="reference internal" href="/native-client/devguide/coding/file-io.html#devguide-coding-fileio"><em>local file IO</em></a> in
Chrome (for example, prior to using an html5fs file system, you must <a class="reference external" href="enabling_file_access">enable
local file IO</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>The <strong>ppapi_main</strong> library simplifies the creation of a NaCl module by
providing a familiar C programming environment. With this library, your
module can have a simple entry point called ppapi_main(), which is similar to
the standard C main() function, complete with argc and argv[] parameters.
Your module can also use standard C functions such as printf(), fopen(), and
fwrite(). For details see include/ppapi_main/ppapi_main.h. For an example of
how to use ppapi_main, see examples/hello_world_stdio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Header files for the new libraries are in the <code>include/</code> directory, source
files are in the <code>src/</code> directory, and compiled libraries are in the <code>lib/</code>
directory.</p>
</section><section id="id11">
<h3 id="id11">Examples</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li><p class="first">The SDK includes two new examples:</p>

<li><strong>hello_nacl_mounts</strong> illustrates how to use standard C library file
operations in a Native Client module through the use of the nacl_mounts
library.</li>
<li><strong>hello_world_stdio</strong> illustrates how to implement a Native Client module
with a ppapi_main() function, and how to write to STDOUT and STDERR in a
module, through the use of the nacl_mounts and ppapi_main libraries. This
example makes it easy for new users to get started with Native Client by
letting them start making changes in a familiar C environment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">With a few exceptions, the Makefile for each example now builds the following
versions of each example:</p>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>glibc toolchain: 32-bit and 64-bit .nexes for the x86 target architecture</li>
<li>newlib toolchain: 32-bit and 64-bit .nexes for the x86 target architecture,
and ARM .nexe for the ARM architecture</li>
<li>pnacl toolchain: .pexe (which is subsequently tranlsated to .nexes for the
x86-32, x86-64, and ARM architectures)</li>
<li>hosted toolchain: .so or .dll (to be executed as a Pepper plug-in in
Chrome)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additionally, each version is built in both a Debug and a Release
configuration.</li>
<li>The Makefile for each example includes two new targets: <code>make RUN</code> and
<code>make LAUNCH</code>. These targets, which are interchangeable, launch a local
server and an instance of Chrome to run an example. When the instance of
Chrome is closed, the local server is shut down as well.</li>
<li>The hello_world_stdio example includes a simplified Makefile that only lists
source dependencies, and invokes the build rules in a separate file
(common.mk).</li>

&#8220;pinnacle&#8221;). The PNaCl toolchain produces architecture-independent executable
files (.pexe files). Chrome doesn&#8217;t yet support .pexe files directly, but if
you want to experiment with this early preview of PNaCl, the toolchain
includes a tool to translate .pexe files into architecture-specific .nexe
files. Take a look at the <code>hello_world</code> example to see how to build a .pexe
file and translate it into multiple .nexe files. Note that PNaCl is currently
restricted to the newlib C standard library – if your application uses glibc,
you can&#8217;t build it with PNaCl.</li>
<li>The <code>create_nmf.py</code> script uses ELF headers (rather than file names) to
determine the architecture of .nexe files. That means you can change the
names of your .nexe files and <code>create_nmf.py</code> will still be able to
generate the appropriate Native Client manifest file for your application.</li>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Build the module into a shared library (.so file) using your system&#8217;s
C/C++ compiler. Test and debug the .so file using the tools in your normal
development environment.</li>
<li>Build the module into a .nexe file using the compiler from one of the
Native Client toolchains in the SDK (nacl-gcc or nacl-g++). Test and debug
the .nexe file using nacl-gdb.</li>
</ol>
<p>This two step development process has many benefits—in particular, you can
use the compilers, debuggers, profilers, and other tools that you&#8217;re already
familiar with. But there are a few potential issues to keep in mind:</p>

<li>All examples in the SDK now comply with version 2 of the Chrome Web Store

<aside class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> It&#8217;s also possible to build a module as a trusted plugin on Mac and
Linux systems, but doing so requires more work because the SDK does not yet
include the above resources (library source files and pre-built libraries)
for Mac and Linux systems. To build and debug a trusted plugin on Mac and
Linux systems, you need to <a class="reference external" href="http://dev.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code">get the Chromium code</a> and then follow
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/how-tos/debugging-documentation/debugging-a-trusted-plugin/trusted-debugging-on-mac">Mac instructions</a>
or <a class="reference external" href="http://www.chromium.org/nativeclient/how-tos/debugging-documentation/debugging-a-trusted-plugin/debugging-a-trusted-plugin-on-linux">Linux instructions</a>.
In the future, the SDK will include resources for hosted development on Mac
and Linux as well as Windows.

<h3 id="id20">Examples</h3>
<ul class="small-gap">
<li>Each example in the SDK now builds both a debug and a release version. As
before, most examples also build newlib and glibc versions, which means that
there are now four versions for each example. Take a look at the Makefiles in
the examples to see the compiler flags that are used for debug and release
versions. For a description of those flags, see <a class="reference internal" href="/native-client/devguide/devcycle/building.html#compile-flags"><em>Compile flags for
different development scenarios</em></a>.</li>
<li>Comments have been added to common.js, which is used in all the examples. The
JavaScript in common.js inserts an &lt;embed&gt; element that loads the NaCl module
in each example&#8217;s web page, attaches event listeners to monitor the loading
of the module, and implements handleMessage() to respond to messages sent
from the NaCl module to the JavaScript side of the application</li>
