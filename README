Weston

Weston is the reference implementation of a Wayland compositor, and a
useful compositor in its own right.  Weston has various backends that
lets it run on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input as well as
under X11.  Weston ships with a few example clients, from simple
clients that demonstrate certain aspects of the protocol to more
complete clients and a simplistic toolkit.  There is also a quite
capable terminal emulator (weston-terminal) and an toy/example desktop
shell.  Finally, weston also provides integration with the Xorg server
and can pull X clients into the Wayland desktop and act as a X window
manager.

Refer to http://wayland.freedesktop.org/building.html for building
weston and its dependencies.

The test suite can be invoked via `make check`; see
http://wayland.freedesktop.org/testing.html for additional details.
