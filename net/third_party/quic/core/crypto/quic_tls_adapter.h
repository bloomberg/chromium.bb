// QuicTlsAdapter provides an implementation of CryptoMessageParser that takes
// incoming messages and provides them to be read in a BIO (used by the TLS
// stack to read incoming messages). Messages written to the BIO by the TLS
// stack are provided to the QuicTlsAdapter's consumer through the
// OnDataReceived method of the consumer's implementation of
// QuicTlsAdapter::Visitor.
//
// QuicTlsAdapter also provides an implementation of the BIO interface,
// openssl's abstraction used by the TLS stack for I/O. The BIO interface
// provides BIO_read, BIO_write, and BIO_flush methods, with an API very similar
// to Berkeley sockets. This is a non-blocking interface - if data is not
// available for the BIO consumer to read with BIO_read, it returns 0 bytes of
// data, and the BIO consumer must handle waiting for more data and only calling
// BIO_read once data is available to read. With a QuicTlsAdapter, the signal
// that data is available to read is provided by
// QuicTlsAdapter::Visitor::OnDataAvailableForBIO.
//
// In effect, the QuicTlsAdapter moves messages between the QuicCryptoStream and
// the TLS stack. On one end, the QuicTlsAdapter implements CryptoMessageParser
// to take incoming messages and make them available to be read through the BIO,
// and on the other end, it takes messages written to the BIO and once the BIO
// flushes them, sends them out to the QuicStream via the
// QuicTlsAdapter::Visitor.
//
// Data flows from a QuicCryptoStream to the TLS stack like so:
//  1. QuicCryptoStream::OnDataAvailable is called (by QuicStream) when data is
//     available on the stream.
//  2. OnDataAvailable calls CryptoMessageParser::ProcessInput; in the case of a
//     TLS crypto stream, this is QuicTlsAdapter::ProcessInput.
//  3. ProcessInput saves the data to QuicTlsAdapter's read buffer, and signals
//     that data is available to read by calling
//     QuicTlsAdapter::Visitor::OnDataAvailableForBIO.
//  4. TlsHandshaker (which implements QuicTlsAdapter::Visitor) receives the
//     OnDataAvailableForBIO, and has the TLS stack continue its handshake.
//  5. The TLS stack calls BIO_read to read handshake messages, and this call is
//     made on a BIO backed by QuicTlsAdapter.
//  6. BIO_read calls QuicTlsAdapter::BIOReadWrapper, which calls
//     QuicTlsAdapter::Read (on the appropriate instance) which provides the
//     data from the read buffer written to by QuicTlsAdapter::ProcessInput.
//
// Data flows from the TLS stack to the QUIC crypto stream like so:
//  1. The TLS stack makes multiple calls to BIO_write as it generates handshake
//     messages. Via QuicTlsAdapter::BIOWriteWrapper and QuicTlsAdapter::Write,
//     this data gets appended to the QuicTlsAdapter's write buffer.
//  2. Once the TLS stack has written a flight of handshake messages, it calls
//     BIO_flush. This, via QuicTlsAdapter::BIOCtrlWrapper and
//     QuicTlsAdapter::Flush, signals to QuicTlsAdapter's Visitor that data has
//     been received.
//  3. QuicTlsAdapter::Flush calls
//     QuicTlsAdapter::Visitor::OnDataReceivedFromBIO with the contents of the
//     write buffer.
//  4. TlsHandshaker receives the data from OnDataReceivedFromBIO, and writes it
//     to the QUIC crypto stream.
