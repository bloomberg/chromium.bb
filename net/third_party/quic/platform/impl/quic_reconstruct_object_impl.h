// Support for marking memory as uninitialized, or otherwise corrupting it. Used
// in testing in an attempt to ensure that there isn't "leakage" of state from
// one sub-test to another. For example, in tests based on RandomDecoderTest,
// the same objects (decoder or decoder destination), will be used multiple
// times as a single encoded input is repeatedly decoded with multiple
// segmentations of the input.
//
// If compiled with Memory Sanitizer, the memory is marked as uninitialized;
// else the memory is overwritten with random bytes.
