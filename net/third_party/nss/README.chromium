Name: Network Security Services (NSS)
URL: http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/
Version: 3.15 Beta 2
Security Critical: Yes
License: MPL 2
License File: NOT_SHIPPED

This directory includes a copy of NSS's libssl from the hg repo at:
  https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss

The same module appears in crypto/third_party/nss (and third_party/nss on some
platforms), so we don't repeat the license file here.

The snapshot was updated to the hg tag: NSS_3_15_BETA2

Patches:

  * Commenting out a couple of functions because they need NSS symbols
    which may not exist in the system NSS library.
    patches/versionskew.patch

  * Send empty renegotiation info extension instead of SCSV unless TLS is
    disabled.
    patches/renegoscsv.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=549042

  * Cache the peer's intermediate CA certificates in session ID, so that
    they're available when we resume a session.
    patches/cachecerts.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=731478

  * Add the SSL_PeerCertificateChain function
    patches/peercertchain.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=731485

  * Add support for client auth with native crypto APIs on Mac and Windows
    patches/clientauth.patch
    ssl/sslplatf.c

  * Add a function to export whether the last handshake on a socket resumed a
    previous session.
    patches/didhandshakeresume.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=731798

  * Allow SSL_HandshakeNegotiatedExtension to be called before the handshake
    is finished.
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=681839
    patches/negotiatedextension.patch

  * Add function to retrieve TLS client cert types requested by server.
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51413
    patches/getrequestedclientcerttypes.patch

  * Add a function to restart a handshake after a client certificate request.
    patches/restartclientauth.patch

  * Add support for TLS Channel IDs
    patches/channelid.patch

  * Add support for extracting the tls-unique channel binding value
    patches/tlsunique.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=563276

  * Define the EC_POINT_FORM_UNCOMPRESSED macro. In NSS 3.13.2 the macro
    definition was moved from the internal header ec.h to blapit.h. When
    compiling against older system NSS headers, we need to define the macro.
    patches/ecpointform.patch

  * SSL_ExportKeyingMaterial should get the RecvBufLock and SSL3HandshakeLock.
    This change was made in https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/10454066.
    patches/secretexporterlocks.patch

  * Allow the constant-time CBC processing code to be compiled against older
    NSS that doesn't contain the CBC constant-time changes.
    patches/cbc.patch
    https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=172658#c12

  * Define AES_256_KEY_LENGTH if the system blapit.h header doesn't define it.
    Remove this patch when all system NSS packages are NSS 3.12.10 or later.
    patches/aes256keylength.patch

  * Change ssl3_SuiteBOnly to always return PR_TRUE. The softoken in NSS
    versions older than 3.15 report an EC key size range of 112 bits to 571
    bits, even when it is compiled to support only the NIST P-256, P-384, and
    P-521 curves. Remove this patch when all system NSS softoken packages are
    NSS 3.15 or later.
    patches/suitebonly.patch

  * Define the SECItemArray type and declare the SECItemArray handling
    functions, which were added in NSS 3.15. Remove this patch when all system
    NSS packages are NSS 3.15 or later.
    patches/secitemarray.patch

  * Remove unused variables in ssl3_SendCertificateStatus.
    patches/unusedvariables.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=866949

  * Fix bugs in the code in ssl3_HandleHandshakeMessage that handles a
    CertificateStatus message.
    patches/handlecertstatus.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=867795

Apply the patches to NSS by running the patches/applypatches.sh script.  Read
the comments at the top of patches/applypatches.sh for instructions.

The ssl/bodge directory contains files taken from the NSS repo that we required
for building libssl outside of its usual build environment.
