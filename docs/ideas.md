### General Project Areas

### Testing

*   Contribute tests. We always need more tests.
*   Write fuzzing tests for Native Client module interfaces.
*   Write fuzzing tests for the validator.

### Application Development

Port a Linux open source game to Native Client. Here's a couple relevant lists:
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games *
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_emulators

Start work on one of the obvious applications: * image editor * drawing program
(remember MacDraw?) * spreadsheet * speech recognition or synthesis

### Infrastructure

Port a popular open source Linux library to Native Client. See
native\_client\_sdk for some libraries we've already ported. * Port SWIG to
generate Native Client stubs on top of the Native Client IMC. This could help us
allow languages like Python to make calls into the browser/JavaScript
environment * Port GTK to Native Client * Port something a lot easier than SWIG
or GTK

Port your favorite language system to Native Client. Awk, Lua, Python, Ruby,
have been ported or are underway. * Port gcj or other interpreted Java system to
Native Client. * Port a new compiler/language to Native Client: ML, Lisp,
Scheme, Smalltalk, Prolog, Cobal, Fortran. * Develop a NPAPI/Pepper interface
for one of these languages.
