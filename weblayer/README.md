# WebLayer

WebLayer is a high level embedding API to support building a browser. While it's
built on top of src/content, the expectation is that the API will hide the
Content API. WebLayer is envisioned to include support for all the modern HTML5
and browser features (e.g. UI for permissions, autofill, safe browsing etc...).
