    Suspected changes are CLs that probably caused failures and will be
    rejected. This method analyzes every failure message and returns a set of
    changes as suspects.
    1) if a failure message is a PackageBuildFailure, get suspects for the build
    failure. If there're failed packages without assigned suspects, blame all
    changes when sanity is True.
    2) if a failure message is a TEST failure, get suspects for the HWTest
    failure. If there're failed HWTests without assigned suspects, blame all
    changes when sanity is True.
    3) If a failure message is neither PackagebuildFailure nor HWTestFailure,
    we can't explain the failure and so blame all changes when sanity is True.

    It is certainly possible to trick this algorithm: If one developer submits
    a change to libchromeos that breaks the power_manager, and another developer
    submits a change to the power_manager at the same time, only the
    power_manager change will be kicked out. That said, in that situation, the
    libchromeos change will likely be kicked out on the next run when the next
    run fails power_manager but dosen't include any changes from power_manager.

    Args:
      changes: A list of cros_patch.GerritPatch instances.
      build_root: The path to the build root.
      failed_hwtests: A list of name of failed hwtests got from CIDB (see the
        return type of HWTestResultManager.GetFailedHWTestsFromCIDB), or None.

        the build started and ended.
