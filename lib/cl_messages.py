  Args:
    pre_cq_trybot: Whether the builder is a Pre-CQ trybot. (Note: The Pre-CQ
      launcher is NOT considered a Pre-CQ trybot.)
    change: The change we want to create a message for.
    suspects: An instance of triage_lib.SuspectChanges.
    messages: A list of build failure messages from supporting builders.
      These must be BuildFailureMessage objects or NoneType objects.
    sanity: A boolean indicating whether the build was considered sane. If
      not sane, none of the changes will have their CommitReady bit modified.
    infra_fail: The build failed purely due to infrastructure failures.
    lab_fail: The build failed purely due to test lab infrastructure failures.
    no_stat: A list of builders which failed prematurely without reporting
      status.
    retry: Whether we should retry automatically.

  Returns:
    A string that communicates what happened.
