  a bunch of stuff, or mixing the quotes).

    cwd: the working directory to run this cmd.
    input: The data to pipe into this command through stdin.  If a file object
      or file descriptor, stdin will be connected directly to that.
    enter_chroot: this command should be run from within the chroot.  If set,
      cwd must point to the scripts directory. If we are already inside the
      chroot, this command will be run as if |enter_chroot| is False.
    shell: Controls whether we add a shell as a command interpreter.  See cmd
      since it has to agree as to the type.
    env: If non-None, this is the environment for the new process.  If
      enter_chroot is true then this is the environment of the enter_chroot,
      most of which gets removed from the cmd run.
    extra_env: If set, this is added to the environment for the new process.

      clear any entries though.
    ignore_sigint: If True, we'll ignore signal.SIGINT before calling the
      child.  This is the desired behavior if we know our child will handle
      Ctrl-C.  If we don't do this, I think we and the child will both get
      Ctrl-C at the same time, which means we'll forcefully kill the child.
    chroot_args: An array of arguments for the chroot environment wrapper.
    debug_level: The debug level of run's output.
    check: Whether to raise an exception when command returns a non-zero exit
      code, or return the CommandResult object containing the exit code.
      Note: will still raise an exception if the cmd file does not exist.
    int_timeout: If we're interrupted, how long (in seconds) should we give the
      invoked process to clean up before we send a SIGTERM.
    kill_timeout: If we're interrupted, how long (in seconds) should we give the
      invoked process to shutdown from a SIGTERM before we SIGKILL it.
    log_output: Log the command and its output automatically.
    capture_output: Set |stdout| and |stderr| to True.
    quiet: Set |print_cmd| to False, |stdout| to True, and |stderr| to
      subprocess.STDOUT.
    mute_output: Mute subprocess printing to parent stdout/stderr. Defaults to
      None, which bases muting on |debug_level|.
    encoding: Encoding for stdin/stdout/stderr, otherwise bytes are used.  Most
      users want 'utf-8' here for string data.
    errors: How to handle errors when |encoding| is used.  Defaults to 'strict',
      but 'ignore' and 'replace' are common settings.
    dryrun: Only log the command,and return a stub result.

  Returns:
    A CommandResult object.

  Raises:
    RunCommandError: Raised on error.
