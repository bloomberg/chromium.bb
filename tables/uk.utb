# The Ukrainian alphabet has 4 letters that are not in the Russian
# alphabet, namely Є, І, Ї and Ґ. Like in ru-chardefs.cti, the
# following definitions have dot 9 set to make them distinguishable
# from the Latin letters. Dot 7 indicates uppercase letters.

# The Russian alphabet also has 4 letters that are not in the
# Ukrainian alphabet, namely Ё, Ъ, Ы and Э. For convenience these
# definitions are not removed however. They're needed to work
# comfortable with both languages. These 4 Russian letters are defined
# in ru-chardefs.cti as follows:

# uplow \x0401\x0451 1679,169         CYRILLIC LETTER IO          Ё
