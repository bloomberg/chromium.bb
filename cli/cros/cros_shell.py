  """Opens a remote shell over SSH on the target device.

  Can be used to start an interactive session or execute a command
  remotely. Interactive sessions can be terminated like a normal SSH
  session using Ctrl+D, `exit`, or `logout`.

  Unlike other `cros` commands, this allows for both SSH key and user
  password authentication. Because a password may be transmitted, the
  known_hosts file is used by default to protect against connecting to
  the wrong device.

  The exit code will be the same as the last executed command.
  """

Examples:
  Start an interactive session:
    cros shell <ip>
    cros shell <user>@<ip>:<port>

  Non-interactive remote command:
    cros shell <ip> -- cat var/log/messages

Quoting can be tricky; the rules are the same as with ssh:
  Special symbols will end the command unless quoted:
    cros shell <ip> -- cat /var/log/messages > log.txt   (saves locally)
    cros shell <ip> -- "cat /var/log/messages > log.txt" (saves remotely)

  One set of quotes is consumed locally, so remote commands that
  require quotes will need double quoting:
    cros shell <ip> -- sh -c "exit 42"    (executes: sh -c exit 42)
    cros shell <ip> -- sh -c "'exit 42'"  (executes: sh -c 'exit 42')
