"""Program to run emerge in parallel, for significant speedup.

Usage:
 ./parallel_emerge [--board=BOARD] [--workon=PKGS]
                   [--force-remote-binary=PKGS] [emerge args] package

Basic operation:
  Runs 'emerge -p --debug' to display dependencies, and stores a
  dependency graph. All non-blocked packages are launched in parallel,
  as 'emerge --nodeps package' with any blocked packages being emerged
  immediately upon deps being met.

  For this to work effectively, /usr/lib/portage/pym/portage/locks.py
  must be stubbed out, preventing portage from slowing itself with
  unneccesary locking, as this script ensures that emerge is run in such
  a way that common resources are never in conflict. This is controlled
  by an environment variable PORTAGE_LOCKS set in parallel emerge
  subprocesses.

  Parallel Emerge unlocks two things during operation, here's what you
  must do to keep this safe:
    * Storage dir containing binary packages. - Don't emerge new
      packages while installing the existing ones.
    * Portage database - You must not examine deps while modifying the
      database. Therefore you may only parallelize "-p" read only access,
      or "--nodeps" write only access.
  Caveats:
    * Some ebuild packages have incorrectly specified deps, and running
      them in parallel is more likely to bring out these failures.
    * Some ebuilds (especially the build part) have complex dependencies
      that are not captured well by this script (it may be necessary to
      install an old package to build, but then install a newer version
      of the same package for a runtime dep).
