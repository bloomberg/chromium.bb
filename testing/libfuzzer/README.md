This directory contains integration between [libFuzzer] and Chromium.
LibFuzzer is an in-process coverage-driven evolutionary fuzzing engine. It helps
engineers to uncover potential security & stability problems.

*** note
**Requirements:** libFuzzer in Chromium is supported with Linux, Chrome OS, Mac,
and Windows.

## Integration Status

Fuzzer tests are well-integrated with Chromium build system and distributed
ClusterFuzz fuzzing system. Cover bug: [crbug.com/539572].

## Documentation

* [Getting Started Guide] walks you through all the steps necessary to create
your fuzz target and submit it to ClusterFuzz.
* [Efficient Fuzzer Guide] explains how to measure fuzz target effectiveness and
ways to improve it.
* [Guide to libprotobuf-mutator] walks through the steps necessary to create a
fuzz target that expects a protobuf as input (instead of a byte stream). In
addition to fuzzing code that accepts protobufs, it can be used to fuzz
code that requires multiple mutated inputs, or to generate inputs defined by a
grammar.
* [ClusterFuzz Integration] describes integration between ClusterFuzz and
libFuzzer.
* [Reproducing Bugs] describes how to reproduce bugs found by libFuzzer/AFL
  and reported by ClusterFuzz.
* [Fuzzing on Chrome OS] describes how to write fuzzers for the non-browser
  parts of Chrome OS.
* [AFL Integration] describes AFL's integration with Chromium and ClusterFuzz.
* [Reference] contains detailed references for different integration parts.

## Trophies
* [ClusterFuzz Bugs] - issues found and automatically filed by ClusterFuzz.
* [Manual Bugs] - issues that were filed manually after running fuzz targets.
* [Pdfium Bugs] - bugs found in pdfium by manual fuzzing.
* [OSS Trophies] - bugs found with libFuzzer in open-source projects.
