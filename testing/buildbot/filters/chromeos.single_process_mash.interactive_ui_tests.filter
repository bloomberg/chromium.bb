# TODO(sky): this now fails because of differences in timing. In particular,
# in classic mode an accelerator that moves focus is processed *after* text
# is inserted, where as now the accelerator runs first, resulting in text
# going to the wrong place. The right fix likely entails updating the test for
# ChromeOS.
