# NOTE: if adding an exclusion for an existing failure (e.g. additional test for
# feature X that is already not working), please add it beside the existing
# failures. Otherwise please reach out to network-service-dev@.

# These tests currently fail when run with --enable-features=NetworkService,NetworkServiceInProcess

# Note: webview aims to support running network service in-process, so the
# tests are also running with NS IP. Multiprocess webview currently does not
# support running NS OOP, https://crbug.com/882650
