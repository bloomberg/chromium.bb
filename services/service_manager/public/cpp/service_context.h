// Encapsulates a connection to the Service Manager in two parts:
//
// - a bound InterfacePtr to mojom::Connector, the primary mechanism
//   by which the instantiating service connects to other services,
//   brokered by the Service Manager.
//
// - a bound InterfaceRequest of mojom::Service, an interface used by the
//   Service Manager to inform this service of lifecycle events and
//   inbound connections brokered by it.
//
// This class owns an instance of a Service implementation, and there should be
// exactly one instance of this class for every logical service instance running
// in the system.
//
// This class is generally used to handle incoming mojom::ServiceRequests from
// the Service Manager. These can either come from ServiceRunner, from the
// command-line (in the form of a pipe token), from a mojom::ServiceFactory
// call, or from some other embedded service-running facility defined by the
// client.

  // Creates a new ServiceContext bound to |request|. This connection may be
  // used immediately to make outgoing connections via connector().
  //
  // This ServiceContext routes all incoming mojom::Service messages and
  // error signals to |service|, which it owns.
  //
  // If either |connector| or |connector_request| is non-null both must be
  // non-null. If both are null, the context will create its own
  // Connector and request to pass to the Service Manager on initialization.

  // other services to this Service instance, and those connections will be
  // abruptly terminated as they can no longer result in OnConnect() or
  // OnBindInterface() calls on the Service.
