// Encapsulates service-side bindings to Service Manager interfaces. Namely,
// this helps receive and dispatch Service interface events to a service
// implementation, while also exposing a working Connector interface the service
// can use to make outgoing interface requests.
//
// A ServiceBinding is considered to be "bound" after |Bind()| is invoked with a
// valid ServiceRequest (or the equivalent constructor is used -- see below).
// Upon connection error or an explicit call to |Close()|, the ServiceBinding
// will be considered "unbound" until another call to |Bind()| is made.
//
// NOTE: A well-behaved service should aim to always close its ServiceBinding
// gracefully by calling |RequestClose()|. Closing a ServiceBinding abruptly
// (by either destroying it or explicitly calling |Close()|) introduces inherent
// flakiness into the system unless the Service's |OnDisconnected()| has already
// been invoked, because otherwise the Service Manager may have in-flight
// interface requests directed at your service instance and these will be
// dropped to the dismay of the service instance which issued them. Exceptions
// can reasonably be made for system-wide shutdown situations where even the
// Service Manager itself will be imminently torn down.
