// Represents access to a video capture device available on the machine.
// The device is stopped automatically when the message pipe corresponding to
// either the Device or the given |receiver| is closed. Note, however, that
// as a response to closing the device, the service may still need to send out
// events such as Receiver.OnBufferRetired(). Clients who need to wait for this
// to complete must explicitly call Stop() and wait for its callback to indicate
// that all events related to stopping device have been sent out.
