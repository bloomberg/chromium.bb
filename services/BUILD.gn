# One Big Target for services to register their unit test sources. This exists
# to avoid having to maintain a separate test binary for every service.
#
# To add tests for a new service, please define a "tests" source_set in the
# service subdirectory and add it as a dependency here. If your unit tests
# use the ServiceTest framework, you must also include corresponding catalog
# entries in the "service_unittests_catalog" target below.
