// Windows are identified by a uint32. The upper 16 bits are the connection id,
// and the lower 16 the id assigned by the client.
//
// The root window is identified with a connection id of 0, and value of 1.
//
// Most functions to the WindowTree take a change_id parameter. When
// WindowTree completes processing of a function WindowTree calls
// WindowTreeClient::OnChangeCompleted() with the change_id supplied by the
// client and the result of the function. This allows the client to track
// whether the call succeeded or not. Calls are done via the client interface
// rather than a callback to ensure ordering. The server does not interpret the
// change id in anyway, it is up to the client to assign a value and use it.
// Generally the change id is an ever increasing integer.
//
// Event processing happens in the following order:
// . The event is sent to the accelerator registered for the PRE_TARGET. If
//   the client consumes the event, matching pointer watchers are notified and
//   processing stops. If the client does not consume the event processing
//   continues.
// . Target window (lookup of the target window depends upon the event type) and
//   matching pointer watchers are notified at the same time. The target is only
//   notified once, even if it has a matching pointer watcher registered. If the
//   target consumes the event, processing stops.
// . Accelerator registered for POST_TARGET. No response is expected from the
//   client for the POST_TARGET and processing of the next continues
//   immediately.
