//   null UDPSocketReceiverPtr is acceptable.
// - Use either Bind() or Connect() before datagrams can be sent or received.
// - (optional) Invoke setters (e.g. SetBroadcast()).
// - Send / request to receive datagrams. Received datagrams will be delivered
//   to the bound receiver's OnReceived() call.
// - Close the socket by destroying the interface pointer.

  // complete the operation. For example, if the implementation queues the
  // requests internally, net::ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES can be returned if the
  // queue doesn't have any space to accept new ReceiveMore().

  //   ...
  //   service->ReceiveMore(3);

  //   service->ReceiveMore(3);
  //   // OnReceived() is called.
  //   // OnReceived() is called.
