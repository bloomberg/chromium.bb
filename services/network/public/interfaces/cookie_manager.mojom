// Note that whether a domain matches a cookie or not is somewhat nuanced.  For

//        + the next entry down.  So the effective domain for x.y.google.com
//        would be google.com, and the effective domain for x.google.co.uk would
//        be google.co.uk.  See the function
//        net::registry_controlled_domains::GetDomainAndRegistry for more
//        details.
//      * If a cookie does not have such a top level domain (e.g. IP address
//        or private hostname), the domain specified in the cookie (the IP
//        address or private hostname) is used.
