Introduction
------------	

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages[1].
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and
is used by screenreaders such as NVDA and Orca. A companion project
liblouisutdml/liblouisxml[2] deals with formatting of braille.

Changes in this release
-----------------------

This release contains a tremendous amount of work many developers.
Many long standing bugs have been fixed. The tables can finally be in
UTF-8. A grand table cleanup removed duplication from the tables.
There are now two extensive test frameworks for table writers. A
number of new tables have been contributed on top of the usual
assortment of table improvements. Thanks to all of this liblouis has
already seen quite a bit of uptake in a number of places, notably the
new DAISY pipeline will ship with this release of liblouis.

New features 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* New Braille tables 
  - Estonian grade 0, thanks to Jürgen Dengo.
  - Portuguese 8 dot Computer braille, Thanks to Rui Fontes
* UTF-8 support in tables 
  Braille tables can now contain UTF-8 in the opcode arguments.
* Improvements to the python bindings 
  All constants defined in liblouis.h are now exposed in the bindings.
* Add a doctest infrastructure 
  These tests are based on the Python doctest framework and are only
  run if there is a Python interpreter on the system
* Add a test harness 
  This test infrastructure allows the user to do table tests in a
  simple and concise syntax. These tests are based on the Python
  nose testing framework and are only run if either Python 2.x or
  3.x with the related nose python module is installed on the
  system. See the documentation for more information. Thanks to
  Mesar Hameed.
* Add a test harness generator 
  A harness generator that uses simple text files with a little
  formatting to help to generate the json harness files. The purpose
  of this tool is to make it much easier and faster to add checks
  for a given table. You are expected to read the generated harness
  file and make necessary changes, the tool only helps you to get
  the tests into the harness format, not check their validity.
* Support for Python 3 in the Python bindings 
  The Python bindings now work for both Python 2 and Python 3.
  Thanks to Michael Whapples.
  
Improved C-based test framework 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Improved the test framework to be able to test translations
    involving Unicode.
  - Added numerous tests, e.g. for lowercase and Unicode, for the
    input position, for repeated, etc.

Improved the documentation 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - Document the test harness (json format, fields, flags).
  - Document the use of Valgrind to find memory leaks
  - Improve the documentation on the display opcode

Bug fixes 
~~~~~~~~~~
  - lou_allround and lou_translate now properly handle Unicode
    characters
  - Fix some issues reported by Valgrind
  - Fix inputPos for situation where context and multipass opcodes
    are involved
  - Fixed a number of bugs with the letter, uppercase and lowercase
    opcodes when dealing with Unicode
  - Fixed a couple of bugs with hyphenation (documentation, Python
    bindings and a number of buffer overruns in the C library).
    Thanks Milan Zamazal <pdm@brailcom.org> for reporting this.
  - Fix a bug in the $a. matcher in the multipass rules where only 32
    chars were matched. It now matches 0xffff chars.
  - Fix a bug reported by James Teh related to pass1Only

Braille Table Improvements 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  - all table files have consistent encoding, UTF-8.
  - The grand table cleanup: Reorganize the tables to remove
    duplication. Move common parts such as Latin letter, eight and
    six dot digit definitions to separate files which are then
    included. This should ease table maintenance. Thanks to Mesar Hameed. 
  - Fixes to de-de-comp8.ctb thanks to Aliminator83@gmail.com
  - hu1.ctb renamed to hu-hu-g1.ctb
  - hu.ctb renamed to hu-hu-comp8.ctb
  - eo.ctb renamed to eo-g1.ctb
  - Fixes to eo-g1.ctb thanks to Aaron Cannon <cannona@fireantproductions.com>
  - hu-hu-g1.ctb: improvements and extensive test harness, with
    working back-translation, Thanks to Hammer Attila
  - Fixes to fr-bfu-comp6.utb and fr-bfu-comp8.utb thanks to Michel
    Such <michel.such@free.fr>
