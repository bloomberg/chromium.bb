The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.8.0. The release is available for download at:

    https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages[1].
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and
is used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion
project liblouisutdml[2] deals with formatting of braille.

Changes in this release
=======================

The major focus of this release is on braille table updates. There are
major updates to German, Arabic, Chinese, Turkish, Dutch, Czech,
Latvian, Spanish and Ethiopic. Some of these new tables have only been
possible because Bert Frees fixed some nasty long standing bugs behind
the scene. Also there is the usual assortment of code improvements and
cleanups.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues[3].
