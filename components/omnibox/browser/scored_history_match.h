  // score is in part determined by whether the matches occur at word
  // boundaries, the locations of which are stored in |word_starts|.  For some

  // instance, the term ".net" should look for a word boundary at the "n".

  // score.  |num_matching_pages| indicates how many URLs in the eligible URL
  // database match the user's input; it can also affect the raw score.  The raw
  // score allows the matches to be ordered and can be used to influence the
  // final score calculated by the client of this index.  If the row does not
