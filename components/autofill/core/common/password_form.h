// The PasswordForm struct encapsulates information about a login form,
// which can be an HTML form or a dialog with username/password text fields.
//
// The Web Data database stores saved username/passwords and associated form
// metdata using a PasswordForm struct, typically one that was created from
// a parsed HTMLFormElement or LoginDialog, but the saved entries could have
// also been created by imported data from another browser.
//
// The PasswordManager implements a fuzzy-matching algorithm to compare saved
// PasswordForm entries against PasswordForms that were created from a parsed
// HTML or dialog form. As one might expect, the more data contained in one
// of the saved PasswordForms, the better the job the PasswordManager can do
// in matching it against the actual form it was saved on, and autofill
// accurately. But it is not always possible, especially when importing from
// other browsers with different data models, to copy over all the information
// about a particular "saved password entry" to our PasswordForm
// representation.
//
// The field descriptions in the struct specification below are intended to
// describe which fields are not strictly required when adding a saved password
// entry to the database and how they can affect the matching process.
