      When a user authenticates via a SAML IdP during login, cookies set by the IdP are written to a temporary profile at first. These cookies can be transferred to the user's profile to carry forward the authentication state.

      When this policy is set to true, cookies set by the IdP are transferred to the user's profile every time they authenticate against the SAML IdP during login.

      When this policy is set to false or unset, cookies set by the IdP are transferred to the user's profile during their first login on a device only.

      This policy affects users whose domain matches the device's enrolment domain only. For all other users, cookies set by the IdP are transferred to the user's profile during their first login on the device only.</translation>

      When this policy is set, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" /> will attempt to find a printer matching all of the specified attributes and select it as default printer. The first printer found that matches the policy is selected. In the case of non-unique match, any matching printer can be selected, depending on the order in which printers are discovered.

      If this policy is not set or a matching printer is not found within the timeout, the printer defaults to built-in PDF printer or no printer selected when PDF printer is not available.
