          Each item of the list is a string that contains an extension ID and an update URL delimited by a semicolon (<ph name="SEMICOLON"/>). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found e.g. on <ph name="CHROME_EXTENSIONS_LINK"/> when in developer mode. The update URL should point to an Update Manifest XML document as described at <ph name="LINK_TO_EXTENSION_DOC1"/>.

          For each item, <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME"/> will retrieve the extension specified by the extension ID from the update service at the specified update URL and silently install it.

          For example, <ph name="EXTENSION_POLICY_EXAMPLE"/> installs the <ph name="EXTENSION_POLICY_EXAMPLE_EXTENSION_NAME"/> extension from the standard Chrome Web Store update URL. For more information about hosting extensions, see: <ph name="LINK_TO_EXTENSION_DOC2"/>.

      The wildcard characters '*' and '?' can be used to match sequences of arbitrary characters. '*' matches an arbitrary number of characters while '?' specifies an optional single character, i.e. matches zero or one characters.

Users can also enable and disable plug-ins that don't match any patterns in DisabledPlugins, DisabledPluginsExceptions and EnabledPlugins.

      This policy is meant to allow for strict plug-in blacklisting where the 'DisabledPlugins' list contains wildcarded entries like disable all plug-ins '*' or disable all Java plug-ins '*Java*' but the administrator wishes to enable some particular version like 'IcedTea Java 2.3'. This particular versions can be specified in this policy.

      Note that both the plug-in name and the plug-in's group name have to be exempted. Each plug-in group is shown in a separate section in about:plug-ins; each section may have one or more plug-ins. For example, the &quot;Shockwave Flash&quot; plug-in belongs to the &quot;Adobe Flash Player&quot; group, and both names have to have a match in the exceptions list if that plug-in is to be exempted from the blacklist.

      If this policy is left not set, any plug-in that matches the patterns in the 'DisabledPlugins' will be locked disabled and the user won't be able to enable them.</translation>
