This setting configures the version at which this fallback process will stop. If a server performs version negotiation correctly (i.e. without breaking the connection) then this setting doesn't apply. Regardless, the resulting connection must still comply with SSLVersionMin.

<translation id="318812033927804102">Configures extension management settings for <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" />.

          This policy controls multiple settings, including settings controlled by any existing extension-related policies. This policy will override any legacy policies if both are set.

          This policy maps an extension ID or an update URL to its configuration. With an extension ID, configuration will be applied to the specified extension only. A default configuration can be set for the special ID "*", which will apply to all extensions that don't have a customised configuration set in this policy. With an update URL, configuration will be applied to all extensions with the exact update URL stated in manifest of this extension, as described at <ph name="LINK_TO_EXTENSION_DOC1" />.

          The configuration for each extension (or extensions with same update URL) is another dictionary that can contain the fields documented below.

          "installation_mode": maps to a string indicating the installation mode for the extension. The valid strings are:
          * "allowed": allows the extension to be installed by the user. This is the default behaviour.
          * "blocked": blocks installation of the extension.
          * "force_installed": the extension is automatically installed and can't be removed by the user.
          * "normal_installed": the extension is automatically installed but can be disabled by the user.

          The "installation_mode" can also be configured for multiple extensions as well, including the "*" extension (as default settings) and extensions with same update URL. Only the "allowed" and "blocked" values can be used in this case.

          If the mode is set to "force_installed" or "normal_installed" then an "update_url" must be configured too. Note that the update URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension will use the update URL indicated in the extension's manifest. The update URL should point to an Update Manifest XML document as mentioned above.

          "blocked_permissions": maps to a list of strings indicating the blocked API permissions for the extension. The permissions names are same as the permission strings declared in manifest of extension as described at <ph name="LINK_TO_EXTENSION_DOC3" />. This setting also can be configured for "*" extension. If the extension requires a permission which is on the blocklist, it will not be allowed to load. If it contains a blocked permission as optional requirement, it will be handled in the normal way, but requesting conflicting permissions will be declined automatically at runtime.

          "allowed_permissions": similar to "blocked_permissions", but instead explicitly allow some permissions which might be blocked by global blocked permission list, thus can not be configured for "*" extension. Note that this setting doesn't give granted permissions to extensions automatically.

          "minimum_version_required": maps to a version string. The format of the version string is the same as the one used in extension manifest, as described at <ph name="LINK_TO_EXTENSION_DOC4" />. An extension with a version older than the specified minimum version will be disabled. This applies to force-installed extensions as well.

          The following settings can be used only for the default "*" configuration:

          "install_sources": Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern (see https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns). Users will be able to easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the *.crx file and the page where the download is started from (i.e. the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns.

          "allowed_types": This setting whitelists the allowed types of extension/apps that can be installed in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" />. The value is a list of strings, each of which should be one of the following: "extension", "theme", "user_script", "hosted_app", "legacy_packaged_app", "platform_app". See the <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" /> extensions documentation for more information on these types.

      The wildcard characters '*' and '?' can be used to match sequences of arbitrary characters. '*' matches an arbitrary number of characters while '?' specifies an optional single character, i.e. matches zero or one characters. The escape character is '\', so to match actual '*', '?', or '\' characters, you can put a '\' in front of them.

      If you enable this setting, the specified list of plug-ins can be used in <ph name="PRODUCT_NAME" />. Users can enable or disable them in 'about:plugins', even if the plug-in also matches a pattern in DisabledPlugins. Users can also enable and disable plug-ins that don't match any patterns in DisabledPlugins, DisabledPluginsExceptions and EnabledPlugins.

      This policy is meant to allow for strict plug-in blacklisting where the 'DisabledPlugins' list contains wildcarded entries like disable all plug-ins '*' or disable all Java plug-ins '*Java*' but the administrator wishes to enable some particular version like 'IcedTea Java 2.3'. This particular versions can be specified in this policy.

      Note that both the plug-in name and the plug-in's group name have to be exempted. Each plug-in group is shown in a separate section in about:plug-ins; each section may have one or more plug-ins. For example, the "Shockwave Flash" plug-in belongs to the "Adobe Flash Player" group, and both names have to have a match in the exceptions list if that plug-in is to be exempted from the blacklist.

      If this policy is left not set, any plug-in that matches the patterns in the 'DisabledPlugins' will be locked disabled and the user won't be able to enable them.</translation>

      This policy prevents the user from loading web pages from blacklisted URLs. The blacklist provides a list of URL patterns that specify which URLs will be blacklisted.

      Each URL pattern can either be a pattern for local files or a generic URL pattern. Local file patterns are of the format 'file://path', where path should be an absolute path to block. All file system locations for which that path is a prefix will be blocked.

      A generic URL pattern has the format 'scheme://host:port/path'.
      If present, only the specified scheme will be blocked. If the scheme:// prefix is not specified, all schemes are blocked.
      The host is required and can be a hostname or an IP address. Subdomains of a hostname will also be blocked. To prevent blocking subdomains, include a '.' before the hostname. The special hostname '*' will block all domains.
      The optional port is a valid port number from 1 to 65535. If none is specified, all ports are blocked.
      If the optional path is specified, only paths with that prefix will be blocked.

      Exceptions can be defined in the URL whitelist policy. These policies are limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries will be ignored.

      Note that it is not recommended to block internal 'chrome://*' URLs since this may lead to unexpected errors.

      If this policy is not set, no URL will be blacklisted in the browser.</translation>
