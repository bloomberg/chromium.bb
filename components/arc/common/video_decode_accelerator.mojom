// This file defines the mojo interface between Android and Chromium for video

// However, the caller may receive it by out-param (for sync calls) or
// via callback (for async calls).
// However, we only use callbacks to Reset, Flush and Initialize
// in the present design and don't use for other functions.
// This is mainly because other VDAClient functions and VDA functions are not
// correlated.
// Please don't use this design as a good reference, it is strongly recommended
// in mojom that all the function results are reported by passed callbacks.

// The interface to access the hardware video decoding accelerator. To use
// the decoder, the client first calls Initialize() and must wait for a
// callback with the result. Once done, the client can feed the decoder with
// input bit streams via Decode(). The decoder will call
// VideoDecodeClient::NotifyEndOfBitstreamBuffer() to notify the client that
// it has finished consuming the contents of the buffer.
//
// The decoder will also call VideoDecodeClient::ProvidePictureBuffers to
// ask for output buffers for decoding. The client must provide at least
// PictureBufferFormat::min_num_buffers of output buffers and tell the decoder
// the number by AssignPictureBuffers(). Those output buffers are imported
// one by one by ImportBufferForPicture(). Afterwards, the video decoder will
// writes the decoded output into those output buffers and notify the client
// via PictureReady() to indicate when a buffer is ready to be used. After
// client finish using the decoded buffer, it can return the buffer back to the
// decoder by ReusePictureBuffer(), allowing the buffer to be reused for
// decoding future frames.
//
// For secure playback, the client only holds the dummy buffers for both output
// and input. The protected buffers will be allocated in server side
// and never shared to the client. For input buffers, the client must call
// AllocateProtectedBuffer() for each handle before passing it to Decode().
// The protected buffers will be allocated at the server side for storing
// decrypted input bit streams. For output buffers, the server will allocated
// the protected output buffers when ImportBufferForPicture() is called;
// this will tell the server to import and use the protected buffer instead of
// the dummy buffer.
