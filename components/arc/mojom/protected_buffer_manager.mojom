// This interface is exposed by the GPU process for translating dummy handles
// for secure buffers into a usable shared memory buffer handle. The output of
// a decryption operation can then be written to that shared memory and will be
// consumed by the video decoder in the GPU.
// NOTE: This does not use a shared memory handle for the return type
// because of incompatibilities between Chrome and Chrome OS mojo versions
// regarding the structure used for sending shared memory handles.
// Next Method ID: 1
