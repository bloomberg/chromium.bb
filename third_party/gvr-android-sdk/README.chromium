Description:
The Google VR SDK for Android supports both Daydream and Cardboard, including a
simple API used for creating apps inserted into Cardboard viewers, and the more
complex API for supporting Daydream-ready phones and the Daydream controller.

Local Modifications:
Only header files in NDK are used. Due to binary size concern, we have decided
to use a static shim library instead of the shared library that comes with
this checkout. The static libraries are downloaded from a public storage through
gclient sync. Currently, the static libraries needs a newer version of
common_library.aar than the one provided by this checkout. So we also download
it from the same public storage. Once the version on github catches up, we will
remove common_library.aar.
For Version 1.10.0, we have two date: 6 Dec 2016 and 10 Feb 2017. The latter
version cherrypick a CL that fix a crash on K and L.
All JNI calls in the static library also needs to be manually registered. So
we have 3 jni related files. These files were generated by
base/android/jni_generator/jni_generator.py from Java files. Modifications to
these generated files are documented in the files.
In order to run automated end-to-end tests on VR features, VR Services
(com.google.vr.vrcore) and in some cases Daydream Home
(com.google.android.vr.home) need to be installed before running tests. These
are downloaded into test-apks/vr_services and test-apks/daydream_home,
respectively. The downloaded APKs are the release APKs that are or were
publicly available via the Play Store.
In order to run automated end-to-end tests that involve a Daydream controller,
controller_test_api.aar needs to be present. This allows us to send controller
events using broadcasts like a real controller sends them over Bluetooth. The
library is open-sourced similar to the other .aars, but since it's only useful
for Chromium at the moment, it is uploaded to storage instead of to GitHub like
the GVR SDK.
