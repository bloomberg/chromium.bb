Version: 2.6
License File: COPYING
Security Critical: yes

Description:
This is a partial copy of Hyphen 2.6 with the following changes:
* Change the input params of hnj_hyphen_load to receive the pointer to a ruleset
  instead of a file path.
* Change RIGHTHYPHENMIN to 2 in hyph_en_US.dic so it hyphenates rec-i-proc-i-ty
  as expected.
The patch is in google.patch.

See 'hyphen.tex' for additional requirements regarding that file.
