Subject: [PATCH 07/10] [fts3] Interior node corruption detection.

In auditing as part of a previous import, I noticed this case which
seemed to allow for buffer overrun.  The nPrefix check was commented out
because nBuffer wasn't always initialized, and I never circled back to
resolve that.

It may be appropriate to just drop this patch, for now leaving it for
consistency.

BUG=84057, 83946
