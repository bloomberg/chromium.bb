Description: YARA is a tool aimed at (but not limited to) helping malware
researchers to identify and classify malware samples. With YARA you can create
descriptions of malware families (or whatever you want to describe) based on
textual or binary patterns. Each description, a.k.a rule, consists of a set of
strings and a boolean expression which determine its logic.

Yara is shipped with the chrome_cleaner component downloaded by Google Chrome
and the software_reporter_tool component fetched by the component updater. It is
not linked directly into Chromium binaries.
