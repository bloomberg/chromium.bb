Description: Robolectric is a unit test framework for Android.
Local Modifications:
- Removed Robolectric's dependence on Maven jars.
- Switched Robolectric's XML parsing logic from using the vtd-xml library to
  using the org.w3c.dom package.
- Hardcoded version number in robolectric-version.properties.
- Hardcoded ShadowProvider service config files. These files are normally
  generated at compile time but it is difficult to use the generated file
  with GN.
- Changed calls of TempDirectory.create to TempDirectory.createDeleteOnExit.
