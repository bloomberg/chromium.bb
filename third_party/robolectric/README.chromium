Description: Robolectric is a unit test framework for Android.
Local Modifications:
- Removed Robolectric's dependence on Maven jars.
- Switched Robolectric's XML parsing logic from using the vtd-xml library to
  using the org.w3c.dom package.
- Hardcoded version number in robolectric-version.properties.
- Hardcoded ShadowProvider service config files. These files are normally
  generated at compile time but it is difficult to use the generated file
  with GN.
- Added template_processor/ directory with Java classes to process Robolectric's
  .vm template files. The template processor creates versions of these classes
  for different Android API levels. The templated code is used to build the
  respective shadows-core-3.0-<API Level>.jar
