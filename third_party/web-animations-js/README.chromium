Description:
An emulator of the Web Animations specification. Web Animations is a new
specification for animated content on the web. It's being developed as a W3C
specification as part of the CSS and SVG working groups. Latest specification at
http://w3c.github.io/web-animations/.

Used as a dependency of Polymer framework (see src/third_party/polymer/v1_0). If
using directly, rather than through Polymer, use only the minified source.
Otherwise there may be CSP issues with inline scripts, etc. This should only be
updated via third_party/polymer/v1_0/reproduce.sh after bumping the version
number in third_party/polymer/v1_0/bower.json.

Local modifications:
The source mapping directives at the end of the minified files have been
removed so the inspector does not try to load the maps, which are not compiled
and would cause Chromium to crash in Debug builds.
