Description:

This library lets you enter, validate, and display an address with correct
semantics for many countries around the world. The library uses the serialized
validation rules from a Google-managed server (without SLA) at
https://i18napis.appspot.com/ssl-aggregate-address. The library is used in
requestAutocomplete dialog and autofill.

Local Modifications:
- Use Chrome's version of JSON reader in chromium/json.cc.
- Use Chrome's version of loose string comparison in chromium/string_compare.cc.
