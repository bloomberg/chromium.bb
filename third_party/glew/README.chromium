Name: The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library
URL: http://glew.sourceforge.net
License File: LICENSE.txt

This is Chrome's local copy of the GLEW library, which is currently
used to interface to OpenGL and extensions to implement the WebGL
specification.

Compared to the original distribution:

  - GLEW was changed to dynamically look up the OpenGL 1.1 entry
    points in addition to those for later OpenGL versions and
    extensions. This was necessary to be able to stop linking directly
    against libGL.so on Linux due to http://crbug.com/16800 .

  - The implementation of NSGLGetProcAddress has been changed to use
    the standard dlfcn.h functions rather than the deprecated
    mach-o/dyld.h ones.

  - A GLEW_NO_GLU #define was added to prevent including GL/glu.h.

  - glxewContextInit() was exposed in glxew.h in order to allow the
    GLX 1.3 entry points to be used to create the first context.

Originally obtained from http://glew.sourceforge.net/ . The
LICENSE.txt from that distribution has been preserved here.
