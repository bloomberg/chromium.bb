== Patches applied on top of zlib ==

 - 0000-build.patch: changes from the upstream version, mostly related to the
   build.
 - 0001-simd.patch: integrate Intel SIMD optimizations from
   https://github.com/jtkukunas/zlib/
 - 0002-uninitializedcheck.patch: default-initialize state->check, see
   crbug.com/697481
 - 0003-use-defines-for-inffast.patch: replace magic numbers with defines.

== Procedure to create a patch file ==

  Assuming you are working in a new feature branch:
 - git format-patch master --stdout > foo.patch # where naming follows a growing
                                                # number plus patch description.
 - git add foo.patch
 - git commit -a -m "Local patch."
 - git rebase -i HEAD~2 # Squashing the second commit

  As patches created in this way will feature a ChangeLog, there is no longer
the need to append this file with a description of what the patch does. This
should help to solve frequent conflicts in pending new patches on
Chromium's zlib.

  The plan for the near future is to insulate better the platform specific
changes to easy updates with new releases of zlib.

  Ideally local changes should have a merge request featured in either:
 - canonical zlib: https://github.com/madler/zlib/
 - zlib-ng: https://github.com/Dead2/zlib-ng
