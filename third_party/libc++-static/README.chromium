  That will give a URL which you should log into with your web browser. The
  username should be the one that is on the ACL for the "chromium-libcpp"
  bucket (probably your @google.com address). Contact the build team for help
  getting access if necessary.

  Copy the code back to the command line util. Ignore the project ID (it's OK
  to just leave blank when prompted).
