Modifications made with initial commit:
- Added the file README.chromium (this file)

Later modifications (see chromium.patch):
- Added OSMesaGetProcAddress to MesaLib/src/mesa/drivers/osmesa/osmesa.def

- Added #pragma optimize('', off) to:
  - MesaLib\src\mesa\main\histogram.c
  - MesaLib\src\mesa\main\image.c
  - MesaLib\src\mesa\main\mipmap.c
  - MesaLib\src\mesa\math\m_eval.c
  - MesaLib\src\mesa\swrast\s_texcombine.c

- Deleted MesaLib/include/EGL/ - it was conflicting with angle
  - Also deleted MesaLib/include/GLES2/ and MesaLib/include/KHR/ for
    similar reasons
  - Deleted MesaLib/include/GLES/ and MesaLib/include/VG/ because they
    were unneeded

- Changed these typedefs in glext.h to be the same as khrplatform.h
    typedef signed long int GLintptr;
    typedef signed long int GLsizeiptr;
    typedef signed long int GLintptrARB;
    typedef signed long int GLsizeiptrARB;

- Commented out this in gl.h:
#if (defined(__BEOS__) && defined(__POWERPC__)) || defined(__QUICKDRAW__)
#  define PRAGMA_EXPORT_SUPPORTED		1
#endif

- Commented out this in osmesa.h:
#if defined(__BEOS__) || defined(__QUICKDRAW__)
#pragma export on
#endif

- Commented out this in gl.h:
#    define GLAPI __declspec(dllimport)

- Added src/glsl/safe_strcmp.[ch] to handle NULL pointers portably.
  Changed several files in src/glsl/ to use this new entry point.

- Added src/mesa/drivers/osmesa/empty.cpp to fix linkage of osmesa.so
  on Mac OS X.

- Changed glcpp-parse.[cy], glcpp.h, ir_function_inlining.cpp, and
  ir_validate.cpp to avoid including inttypes.h on Windows.

- Changed glapi_nop.c to generate custom OpenGL entry points rather
  than simply installing NoOpGeneric, because with __stdcall calling
  convention it is illegal to have a mismatch in the number of
  arguments passed from caller to callee.

- Guarded #define PUBLIC in compiler.h to avoid warnings about macro
  redefinitions.

- Changed querymatrix.c to understand availability of fpclassify on
  Linux.

- Guarded all usage of EGL_Y_INVERTED_NOK with EGL_NOK_texture_from_pixmap
  so that it can be compiled against standard EGL 1.4 headers.
  
- Initialized uninitialized mask variable in eglconfig.c line 245.

- Fixed compiler warning about cast to pointer from integer of different size
  in eglapi.c line 276. Replaced void* with EGLNativeDisplayType.

- Suppressed spurious compiler warning from gcc in eglCompareConfig by
  reorganizing the .h a little
