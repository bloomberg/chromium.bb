// If a box has more than one fragment (i.e. is paginated by an ancestor), the
// fragments are called "paginated fragments". Note that this is a Blink
// vocabulary extension and doesn't come from the specification.
//
// The fragments are collected by calling PaintLayer::collectFragments
// on every box once per paint/hit-testing operation.
