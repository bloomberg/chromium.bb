// Note: The spec says "the XPathEvaluator interface will be implemented on the
// same object which implements the Document interface" and does not define a
// constructor or other means to create an XPathEvaluator object. Nonetheless,
// Blink, Gecko, Presto, WebKit and all have these APIs on both Document and the
// constructable XPathEvaluator interface.
