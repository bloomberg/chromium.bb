// Blink are used on real web pages and help us know commonly
// features are used and thus when it's safe to remove or change them.
//
// The Chromium Content layer controls what is done with this data.
//
// For instance, in Google Chrome, these counts are submitted anonymously
// through the UMA histogram recording system in Chrome for users who have the
// "Automatically send usage statistics and crash reports to Google" setting
// enabled:
// http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/privacy.html
