# DOM

[Rendered](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/third_party/WebKit/Source/core/dom/README.md)

This directory contains the implementation of [DOM].

[DOM]: https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/
[DOM Standard]: https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/

Basically, this directory should contain only a file which is related to [DOM Standard].
However, for historical reasons, `core/dom` directory has been used
as if it were *misc* directory. As a result, unfortunately, this directory
contains a lot of files which are not directly related to DOM.

Please don't add unrelated files to this directory any more.  We are trying to
organize the files so that developers wouldn't get confused at seeing this
directory.

-   See the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OydPU6r8CTj8HC4D9_gVkriJETu1Egcw2RlajYcw3FM/edit?usp=sharing), as a rough plan to organize Source/core/dom files.

    The classification in the spreadsheet might be wrong. Please update the spreadsheet, and move files if you can,
    if you know more appropriate places for each file.

-   See [crbug.com/738794](http://crbug.com/738794) for tracking our efforts.
