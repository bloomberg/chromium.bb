// An old version of CSSOM View Module defines the ClientRectList interface:
// https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-cssom-view-20110804/#the-clientrectlist-interface

// It has since been replace by DOMRectList in CSSOM View Module and
// Geometry Interfaces Module:
// https://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom-view/#extension-to-the-element-interface
// https://drafts.fxtf.org/geometry/#DOMRectList

// CSSOM View Module also says: "The DOMRectList interface is at-risk.
// The authors of this specification await feedback from implementers
// if the item() function of DOMRectList is currently in use on legacy
// interfaces. If there is no/not enough content to justify
// DOMRectList, legacy interfaces must use sequences instead and
// DOMRectList will be removed from this specification."

interface ClientRectList {
    readonly attribute unsigned long length;
    [MeasureAs=ClientRectListItem] ClientRect item(unsigned long index);
    getter ClientRect (unsigned long index);
};
