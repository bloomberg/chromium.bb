"""Parser for Blink IDL.

The parser uses the PLY (Python Lex-Yacc) library to build a set of parsing
rules which understand the Blink dialect of Web IDL.
It derives from a standard Web IDL parser, overriding rules where Blink IDL
differs syntactically or semantically from the base parser, or where the base
parser diverges from the Web IDL standard.

    # Below are grammar rules used by yacc, given by functions named p_<RULE>.
    # * The docstring is the production rule in BNF (grammar).
    # * The body is the yacc action (semantics).
    #
    # The PLY framework builds the actual low-level parser by introspecting this
    # parser object, selecting all attributes named p_<RULE> as grammar rules.
    # It extracts the docstrings and uses them as the production rules, building
    # the table of a LALR parser, and uses the body of the functions as actions.
    #
    # Reference:
    # http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ply.html#ply_nn23
    #
    # Review of yacc:
    # Yacc parses a token stream, internally producing a Concrete Syntax Tree
    # (CST), where each node corresponds to a production rule in the grammar.
    # At each node, it runs an action, which is usually "produce a node in the
    # Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)" or "ignore this node" (for nodes in the CST
    # that aren't included in the AST, since only needed for parsing).
    #
    # The rules use pseudo-variables; in PLY syntax:
    # p[0] is the left side: assign return value to p[0] instead of returning,
    # p[1] ... p[n] are the right side: the values can be accessed, and they
    # can be modified.
    # (In yacc these are $$ and $1 ... $n.)
    #
    # The rules can look cryptic at first, but there are a few standard
    # transforms from the CST to AST. With these in mind, the actions should
    # be reasonably legible.
    #
    # * Ignore production
    #   Discard this branch. Primarily used when one alternative is empty.
    #
    #   Sample code:
    #   if len(p) > 1:
    #       p[0] = ...
    #   # Note no assignment if len(p) == 1
    #
    # * Eliminate singleton production
    #   Discard this node in the CST, pass the next level down up the tree.
    #   Used to ignore productions only necessary for parsing, but not needed
    #   in the AST.
    #
    #   Sample code:
    #   p[0] = p[1]
    #
    # * Build node
    #   The key type of rule. In this parser, produces object of class IDLNode.
    #   There are several helper functions:
    #   * BuildProduction: actually builds an IDLNode, based on a production.
    #   * BuildAttribute: builds an IDLAttribute, which is a temporary
    #                     object to hold a name-value pair, which is then
    #                     set as a Property of the IDLNode when the IDLNode
    #                     is built.
    #   * BuildNamed: Same as BuildProduction, and sets the 'NAME' property.
    #   * BuildTrue: BuildAttribute with value True, for flags.
    #   See base idl_parser.py for definitions and more examples of use.
    #
    #   Sample code:
    #   # Build node of type NodeType, with value p[1], and children.
    #   p[0] = self.BuildProduction('NodeType', p, 1, children)
    #
