// This WebURLLoaderClient.cpp, which includes only
// WebURLLoaderClient.h, should be in Source/platform/exported,
// because WebURLLoaderClient is not compiled without this cpp.
// So if we don't have this cpp, we will see unresolved symbol error
// when constructor/destructor's address is required.
