  //   tasks. Lowest guarantees. Can be paused, blocked during user gesture,
  //   throttled when backgrounded or stopped completely after some time in
  //   background.
  // - deferrable task queue. These tasks can be deferred for a small period
  //   (several seconds) when high-priority work is anticipated. These tasks
  //   can be paused.
  // - pausable task queue. Default queue for high-priority javascript tasks.
  //   They can be paused according to the spec during javascript alert
  //   dialogs, printing windows and devtools debugging. Otherwise scheduler
  //   does not tamper with their execution.
  // - unpausable task queue. Should be used for control tasks which should
  //   run when the context is paused. Usage should be extremely rare.
  //   Please consult scheduler-dev@ before using it. Running javascript
  //   on it is strictly verboten and can lead to hard-to-diagnose errors.
  //
  //
  // These queues below are separate due to special handling for their
  // priorities.
  // - loading task queue. Similar to deferrable task queue. Throttling might
  //   be considered in the future.
  // - loading control task queue. Loading task queue with increased priority
  //   to run small loading tasks which schedule other loading tasks.
