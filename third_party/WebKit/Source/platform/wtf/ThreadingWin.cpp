/*
 * There are numerous academic and practical works on how to implement
 * pthread_cond_wait/pthread_cond_signal/pthread_cond_broadcast
 * functions on Win32. Here is one example:
 * http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/win32-cv-1.html which is widely credited as
 * a 'starting point' of modern attempts. There are several more or less proven
 * implementations, one in Boost C++ library (http://www.boost.org) and another
 * in pthreads-win32 (http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/).
 *
 * The number of articles and discussions is the evidence of significant
 * difficulties in implementing these primitives correctly.  The brief search
 * of revisions, ChangeLog entries, discussions in comp.programming.threads and
 * other places clearly documents numerous pitfalls and performance problems
 * the authors had to overcome to arrive to the suitable implementations.
 * Optimally, WebKit would use one of those supported/tested libraries
 * directly.  To roll out our own implementation is impractical, if even for
 * the lack of sufficient testing. However, a faithful reproduction of the code
 * from one of the popular supported libraries seems to be a good compromise.
 *
 * The early Boost implementation
 * (http://www.boxbackup.org/trac/browser/box/nick/win/lib/win32/boost_1_32_0/libs/thread/src/condition.cpp?rev=30)
 * is identical to pthreads-win32
 * (http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/pthreads/pthread_cond_wait.c?rev=1.10&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&cvsroot=pthreads-win32).
 * Current Boost uses yet another (although seemingly equivalent) algorithm
 * which came from their 'thread rewrite' effort.
 *
 * This file includes timedWait/signal/broadcast implementations translated to
 * WebKit coding style from the latest algorithm by Alexander Terekhov and
 * Louis Thomas, as captured here:
 * http://sourceware.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/pthreads/pthread_cond_wait.c?rev=1.10&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup&cvsroot=pthreads-win32
 * It replaces the implementation of their previous algorithm, also documented
 * in the same source above.  The naming and comments are left very close to
 * original to enable easy cross-check.
 *
 * The corresponding Pthreads-win32 License is included below, and CONTRIBUTORS
 * file which it refers to is added to source directory (as
 * CONTRIBUTORS.pthreads-win32).
