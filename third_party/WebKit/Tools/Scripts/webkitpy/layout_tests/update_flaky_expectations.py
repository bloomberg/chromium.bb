"""Updates TestExpectations based on results in builder bots.

Scans the TestExpectations file and uses results from actual builder bots runs
to remove tests that are marked as flaky but don't fail in the specified way.

E.g. If a test has this expectation:
    bug(test) fast/test.html [ Failure Pass ]

And all the runs on builders have passed the line will be removed.

Additionally, the runs don't all have to be Passing to remove the line;
as long as the non-Passing results are of a type not specified in the
expectation this line will be removed. For example, if this is the
expectation:

    bug(test) fast/test.html [ Crash Pass ]

But the results on the builders show only Passes and Timeouts, the line
will be removed since there's no Crash results.
