This test checks the SVGLength API

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".



Check initial length values
PASS length.unitType is SVGLength.SVG_LENGTHTYPE_NUMBER
PASS length.value is 0
PASS length.valueInSpecifiedUnits is 0
PASS length.valueAsString is "0"

Set value to be 2px
PASS length.unitType is SVGLength.SVG_LENGTHTYPE_PX
PASS length.value is 2
PASS length.valueInSpecifiedUnits is 2
PASS length.valueAsString is "2px"

Check invalid arguments for 'convertToSpecifiedUnits'
PASS length.convertToSpecifiedUnits(SVGLength.SVG_LENGTHTYPE_UNKNOWN) threw exception NotSupportedError: The implementation did not support the requested type of object or operation..
PASS length.convertToSpecifiedUnits(-1) threw exception NotSupportedError: The implementation did not support the requested type of object or operation..
PASS length.convertToSpecifiedUnits(11) threw exception NotSupportedError: The implementation did not support the requested type of object or operation..
PASS length.convertToSpecifiedUnits('aString') threw exception NotSupportedError: The implementation did not support the requested type of object or operation..
PASS length.convertToSpecifiedUnits(length) threw exception NotSupportedError: The implementation did not support the requested type of object or operation..
