Cycles of AudioNode connections should be collected, after rendering.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


A cycle was created:
PASS internals.audioHandlerCount() > initialCount is true
GC happened:
PASS internals.audioHandlerCount() is initialCount
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
