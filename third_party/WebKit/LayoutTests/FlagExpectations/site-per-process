# The tests below set document.domain.  Such tests are skipped, because they
# cannot work when same-site WPT origins are isolated from each other via
# --isolate-origins cmdline flag (which is how bots run the

# https://crbug.com/783416 tracks adding a WPT origin that is cross-site, but
# even after this bug is fixed we may decide to keep the current
# --isolate-origins coverage and therefore the tests might end up being skipped
# for the foreseeable future.
