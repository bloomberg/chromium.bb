       In the current code, a layer may actually be composited, but not have its own backing.
       In these cases, the layer paints into its composited ancestor with a backing.
       For fixed-position elements, however, this goes wrong because no other code
       realizes that there is a software-painted fixed-position element.  As a result,
       the composited parent does not receive repaint invalidations, and the fixed-position
       element incorrectly appears to be fixed to the composited element rather than the viewport.

       The scenario that reproduces this:  A fixed position element that has an overflow-clip with
       a composited child.  In this case, the fixed-position element needs to be composited.
       However, this is one of the few reasons that does not require that the composited layer needs
       its own backing.
