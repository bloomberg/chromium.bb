PASS Constructing a CSSRotation with a CSSMathValue that doesn't match <angle> for the angle throws a TypeError
PASS Constructing a CSSRotation with a CSSUnitValue with type other than number for the coordinates throws a TypeError
PASS Constructing a CSSRotation with a CSSMathValue that doesn't match <number> for the coordinates throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSRotation.x to a CSSUnitValue with type other than number throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSRotation.x to a CSSMathValue that doesn't match <number> throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSRotation.y to a CSSUnitValue with type other than number throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSRotation.y to a CSSMathValue that doesn't match <number> throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSRotation.z to a CSSUnitValue with type other than number throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSRotation.z to a CSSMathValue that doesn't match <number> throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSRotation.angle to a CSSUnitValue with type other than angle throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSRotation.angle to a CSSMathValue that doesn't match <angle> throws a TypeError
PASS CSSRotation can be constructed from a single angle
FAIL CSSRotation can be constructed from numberish coordinates angle is not defined
FAIL CSSRotation can be constructed from CSSMathValues Failed to construct 'CSSRotation': Must specify an number unit
PASS CSSRotation.x can be updated to a double
PASS CSSRotation.x can be updated to a number CSSUnitValue
FAIL CSSRotation.x can be updated to a CSSMathValue matching <number> Failed to set the 'x' property on 'CSSRotation': Must specify a number unit
PASS CSSRotation.y can be updated to a double
PASS CSSRotation.y can be updated to a number CSSUnitValue
FAIL CSSRotation.y can be updated to a CSSMathValue matching <number> Failed to set the 'y' property on 'CSSRotation': Must specify a number unit
PASS CSSRotation.z can be updated to a double
PASS CSSRotation.z can be updated to a number CSSUnitValue
FAIL CSSRotation.z can be updated to a CSSMathValue matching <number> Failed to set the 'z' property on 'CSSRotation': Must specify a number unit
PASS CSSRotation.angle can be updated to a degree CSSUnitValue
FAIL CSSRotation.angle can be updated to a CSSMathValue matching <angle> Failed to set the 'angle' property on 'CSSRotation': Must pass an angle to CSSRotation
PASS Modifying CSSRotation.is2D can be updated to true or false
