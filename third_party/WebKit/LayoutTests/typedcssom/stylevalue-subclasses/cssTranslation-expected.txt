This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Constructing a CSSTranslation with a CSSUnitValue with type other than length or percent for the coordinates throws a TypeError
PASS Constructing a CSSTranslation with a CSSMathValue that doesn't match <length-percentage> for the coordinates throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSTranslation.x to a CSSUnitValue with type other than length or percent throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSTranslation.x to a CSSMathValue that doesn't match <length-percentage> throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSTranslation.y to a CSSUnitValue with type other than length or percent throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSTranslation.y to a CSSMathValue that doesn't match <length-percentage> throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSTranslation.z to a CSSUnitValue with type other than length or percent throws a TypeError
PASS Updating CSSTranslation.z to a CSSMathValue that doesn't match <length-percentage> throws a TypeError
PASS CSSTranslation can be constructed from two length or percent coordinates
PASS CSSTranslation can be constructed from three length or percent coordinates
FAIL CSSTranslation can be constructed from CSSMathValues Failed to construct 'CSSTranslation': Must pass length or percentage to X and Y of CSSTranslation
PASS CSSTranslation.x can be updated to a length
PASS CSSTranslation.x can be updated to a percent
FAIL CSSTranslation.x can be updated to a CSSMathValue Failed to set the 'x' property on 'CSSTranslation': Must pass length or percentage to X of CSSTranslation
PASS CSSTranslation.y can be updated to a length
PASS CSSTranslation.y can be updated to a percent
FAIL CSSTranslation.y can be updated to a CSSMathValue Failed to set the 'y' property on 'CSSTranslation': Must pass length or percent to Y of CSSTranslation
PASS CSSTranslation.z can be updated to a length
FAIL CSSTranslation.z can be updated to a percent Failed to set the 'z' property on 'CSSTranslation': Must pass length to Z of CSSTranslation
FAIL CSSTranslation.z can be updated to a CSSMathValue Failed to set the 'z' property on 'CSSTranslation': Must pass length to Z of CSSTranslation
PASS Modifying CSSTranslation.is2D can be updated to true or false
