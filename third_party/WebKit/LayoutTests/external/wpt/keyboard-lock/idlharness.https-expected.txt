This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Navigator interface: operation requestKeyboardLock(sequence) assert_throws: calling operation with this = null didn't throw TypeError function "function () {
            fn.apply(obj, args);
        }" did not throw
PASS Navigator interface: operation cancelKeyboardLock() 
PASS Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "requestKeyboardLock" with the proper type (0) 
PASS Navigator interface: calling requestKeyboardLock(sequence) on navigator with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "cancelKeyboardLock" with the proper type (1) 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
