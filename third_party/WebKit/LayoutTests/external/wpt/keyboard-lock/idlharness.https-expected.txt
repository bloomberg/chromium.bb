This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Navigator interface: operation keyboardLock(sequence) assert_throws: calling operation with this = null didn't throw TypeError function "function() {
            fn.apply(obj, args);
        }" did not throw
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for keyboardLock(sequence) on Navigator
PASS Navigator interface: operation keyboardUnlock()
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for keyboardUnlock() on Navigator
PASS Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "keyboardLock(sequence)" with the proper type
PASS Navigator interface: calling keyboardLock(sequence) on navigator with too few arguments must throw TypeError
PASS Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "keyboardUnlock()" with the proper type
