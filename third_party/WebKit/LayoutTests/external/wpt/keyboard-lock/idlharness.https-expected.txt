This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Navigator interface: operation keyboardLock(sequence) assert_throws: calling operation with this = null didn't throw TypeError function "function () {
            fn.apply(obj, args);
        }" did not throw
PASS Navigator interface: operation keyboardUnlock()
PASS Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "keyboardLock(sequence)" with the proper type
PASS Navigator interface: calling keyboardLock(sequence) on navigator with too few arguments must throw TypeError
PASS Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "keyboardUnlock()" with the proper type
Harness: the test ran to completion.
