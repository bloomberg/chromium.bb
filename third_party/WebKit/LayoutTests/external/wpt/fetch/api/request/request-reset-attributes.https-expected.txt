FAIL Request.IsHistoryNavigation should persist. assert_unreached: unregister and register should not fail: Failed to register a ServiceWorker: The path of the provided scope ('/fetch/api/resources/blank.html') is not under the max scope allowed ('/fetch/api/request/resources/'). Adjust the scope, move the Service Worker script, or use the Service-Worker-Allowed HTTP header to allow the scope. Reached unreachable code
