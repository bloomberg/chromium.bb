FAIL setter on DOMStringMap must not enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when adding an unobserved data attribute define_new_custom_element is not defined
FAIL setter on DOMStringMap must enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when mutating the value of an observed data attribute define_new_custom_element is not defined
FAIL setter on DOMStringMap must enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when mutating the value of an observed data attribute to the same value define_new_custom_element is not defined
FAIL setter on DOMStringMap must not enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when mutating the value of an unobserved data attribute define_new_custom_element is not defined
FAIL deleter on DOMStringMap must enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when removing an observed data attribute define_new_custom_element is not defined
FAIL deleter on DOMStringMap must not enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when removing an unobserved data attribute define_new_custom_element is not defined
FAIL deleter on DOMStringMap must not enqueue an attributeChanged reaction when it does not remove a data attribute define_new_custom_element is not defined
Harness: the test ran to completion.
