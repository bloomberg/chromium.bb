This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS pointerlock interfaces.
PASS MouseEvent interface: attribute movementX
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for movementX property on MouseEvent
PASS MouseEvent interface: attribute movementY
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for movementY property on MouseEvent
PASS MouseEvent interface: new MouseEvent('foo') must inherit property "movementX" with the proper type
PASS MouseEvent interface: new MouseEvent('foo') must inherit property "movementY" with the proper type
PASS Document interface: attribute onpointerlockchange
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for onpointerlockchange property on Document
PASS Document interface: attribute onpointerlockerror
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for onpointerlockerror property on Document
PASS Document interface: operation exitPointerLock()
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for exitPointerLock() on Document
PASS Document interface: attribute pointerLockElement
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for pointerLockElement property on Document
FAIL Document interface: window.document must inherit property "onpointerlockchange" with the proper type Unrecognized type EventHandler
FAIL Document interface: window.document must inherit property "onpointerlockerror" with the proper type Unrecognized type EventHandler
PASS Document interface: window.document must inherit property "exitPointerLock()" with the proper type
PASS Document interface: window.document must inherit property "pointerLockElement" with the proper type
PASS Element interface: operation requestPointerLock()
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for requestPointerLock() on Element
PASS Element interface: window.document.documentElement must inherit property "requestPointerLock()" with the proper type
Harness: the test ran to completion.
