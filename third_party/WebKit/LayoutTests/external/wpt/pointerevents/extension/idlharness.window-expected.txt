This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS idl_test setup
PASS Partial dictionary PointerEventInit: original dictionary defined
PASS Partial interface PointerEvent: original interface defined
PASS PointerEvent interface: operation getCoalescedEvents()
FAIL PointerEvent interface: operation getPredictedEvents() assert_own_property: interface prototype object missing non-static operation expected property "getPredictedEvents" missing
PASS PointerEvent interface: new PointerEvent("pointer") must inherit property "getCoalescedEvents()" with the proper type
FAIL PointerEvent interface: new PointerEvent("pointer") must inherit property "getPredictedEvents()" with the proper type assert_inherits: property "getPredictedEvents" not found in prototype chain
Harness: the test ran to completion.
