FAIL Test sequence AppendMode appendBuffer(second media segment) assert_equals: sourceBuffer.buffered range begins where expected before EOS expected 0.001 but got 0
FAIL Test sequence AppendMode appendBuffer(second media segment, then first media segment) assert_equals: expectedTimestampOffset expected 0.802 but got 0.801
