This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Demuxed content with different lengths assert_equals: mediaSource.activeSourceBuffers[0] expected "{ [0.000, 2.023) }" but got "{ [0.000, 2.022) }"
FAIL Muxed content with different lengths assert_equals: mediaSource.activeSourceBuffers[0] expected "{ [0.003, 2.004) }" but got "{ [0.000, 2.003) }"
FAIL Demuxed content with an empty buffered range on one SourceBuffer assert_equals: mediaSource.activeSourceBuffers[0] expected "{ [0.000, 2.023) }" but got "{ [0.000, 2.022) }"
PASS Muxed content empty buffered ranges.
PASS Get buffered range when sourcebuffer is empty.
PASS Get buffered range when only init segment is appended.
PASS Get buffered range after removing sourcebuffer.
Harness: the test ran to completion.
