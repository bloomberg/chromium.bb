This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS HTMLCanvasElement interface: operation captureStream(double) 
PASS HTMLCanvasElement must be primary interface of [object HTMLCanvasElement] 
PASS Stringification of [object HTMLCanvasElement] 
PASS HTMLCanvasElement interface: [object HTMLCanvasElement] must inherit property "captureStream" with the proper type (0) 
PASS HTMLCanvasElement interface: calling captureStream(double) on [object HTMLCanvasElement] with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS HTMLMediaElement interface: operation captureStream() 
FAIL HTMLMediaElement must be primary interface of [object HTMLUnknownElement] assert_equals: [object HTMLUnknownElement]'s prototype is not HTMLMediaElement.prototype expected object "[object HTMLMediaElement]" but got object "[object HTMLUnknownElement]"
FAIL Stringification of [object HTMLUnknownElement] assert_equals: class string of [object HTMLUnknownElement] expected "[object HTMLMediaElement]" but got "[object HTMLUnknownElement]"
FAIL HTMLMediaElement interface: [object HTMLUnknownElement] must inherit property "captureStream" with the proper type (0) assert_inherits: property "captureStream" not found in prototype chain
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface object length 
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface object name 
FAIL CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: class string of CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack.prototype expected "[object CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrackPrototype]" but got "[object CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack]"
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: attribute canvas 
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: operation requestFrame() 
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack must be primary interface of [object CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack] 
PASS Stringification of [object CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack] 
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: [object CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack] must inherit property "canvas" with the proper type (0) 
PASS CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack interface: [object CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack] must inherit property "requestFrame" with the proper type (1)
