This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Test IDL implementation of Permissions API
PASS Partial interface Navigator: original interface defined
PASS Partial interface Navigator: valid exposure set
PASS Partial interface WorkerNavigator: original interface defined
FAIL Partial interface WorkerNavigator: valid exposure set Partial WorkerNavigator interface is exposed to 'DedicatedWorker', the original interface is not.
PASS Navigator interface: attribute permissions
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for permissions property on Navigator
PASS Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "permissions" with the proper type
FAIL WorkerNavigator interface: member permissions Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'permissions' in undefined
PASS PermissionStatus interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS PermissionStatus interface object length
PASS PermissionStatus interface object name
PASS PermissionStatus interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS PermissionStatus interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS PermissionStatus interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS PermissionStatus interface: attribute state
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for state property on PermissionStatus
PASS PermissionStatus interface: attribute onchange
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for onchange property on PermissionStatus
PASS PermissionStatus must be primary interface of permissionStatus
PASS Stringification of permissionStatus
PASS PermissionStatus interface: permissionStatus must inherit property "state" with the proper type
PASS PermissionStatus interface: permissionStatus must inherit property "onchange" with the proper type
PASS Permissions interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS Permissions interface object length
PASS Permissions interface object name
PASS Permissions interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS Permissions interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS Permissions interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS Permissions interface: operation query(object)
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for query(object) on Permissions
PASS Permissions must be primary interface of navigator.permissions
PASS Stringification of navigator.permissions
PASS Permissions interface: navigator.permissions must inherit property "query(object)" with the proper type
PASS Permissions interface: calling query(object) on navigator.permissions with too few arguments must throw TypeError
Harness: the test ran to completion.
