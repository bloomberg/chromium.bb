This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Gyroscope: Test that 'onreading' is called and sensor reading is valid
PASS Gyroscope: sensor reading is correct
PASS Gyroscope: sensor timestamp is updated when time passes
PASS Gyroscope: Test that sensor can be successfully created and its states are correct.
PASS Gyroscope: sensor.start() returns undefined
PASS Gyroscope: no exception is thrown when calling start() on already started sensor
PASS Gyroscope: sensor.stop() returns undefined
PASS Gyroscope: no exception is thrown when calling stop() on already stopped sensor
PASS Gyroscope: Test that fresh reading is fetched on start()
PASS Gyroscope: frequency hint works
PASS Gyroscope: sensor receives suspend / resume notifications when  cross-origin subframe is focused
FAIL Gyroscope: throw 'TypeError' if frequency is invalid assert_throws: when freq is undefined function "() => { new sensorType({frequency: freq}) }" did not throw
PASS Gyroscope: sensor reading is correct when options.referenceFrame is 'screen'
PASS Gyroscope: throw 'TypeError' if referenceFrame is not one of enumeration values
Harness: the test ran to completion.
