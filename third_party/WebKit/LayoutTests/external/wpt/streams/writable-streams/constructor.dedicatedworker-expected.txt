PASS WritableStreamDefaultController constructor should throw
PASS WritableStreamDefaultController constructor should throw when passed an initialised WritableStream
PASS WritableStreamDefaultWriter should throw unless passed a WritableStream
PASS WritableStreamDefaultWriter constructor should throw when stream argument is locked
