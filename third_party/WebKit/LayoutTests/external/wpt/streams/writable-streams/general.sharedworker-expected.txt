This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS desiredSize on a released writer
PASS desiredSize initial value
PASS desiredSize on a writer for a closed stream
PASS desiredSize on a writer for an errored stream
PASS ws.getWriter() on a closing WritableStream
PASS ws.getWriter() on a closed WritableStream
PASS ws.getWriter() on an aborted WritableStream
PASS ws.getWriter() on an errored WritableStream
PASS closed and ready on a released writer
PASS WritableStream should call underlying sink methods as methods
FAIL methods should not not have .apply() or .call() called assert_throws: writer2.closed should be rejected function "function() { throw e }" threw object "TypeError: The stream is in the process of being aborted" ("TypeError") expected object "abort error" ("abort error")
PASS WritableStream's strategy.size should not be called as a method
PASS redundant releaseLock() is no-op
PASS ready promise should fire before closed on releaseLock
Harness: the test ran to completion.
