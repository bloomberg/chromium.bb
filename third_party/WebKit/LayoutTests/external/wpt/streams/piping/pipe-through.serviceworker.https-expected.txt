This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Service worker test setup 
PASS Piping through a duck-typed pass-through transform stream should work 
PASS Piping through a transform errored on the writable end does not cause an unhandled promise rejection 
PASS pipeThrough generically calls pipeTo with the appropriate args 
PASS pipeThrough can handle calling a pipeTo that returns a non-promise object 
PASS pipeThrough can handle calling a pipeTo that returns a non-promise thenable object 
PASS pipeThrough should mark a real promise from a fake readable as handled 
PASS pipeThrough should not be fooled by an object whose instanceof Promise returns true 
FAIL undefined readable or writable arguments should cause pipeThrough to throw assert_throws: pipeThrough should throw for argument {} (index 0); function "() => rs.pipeThrough(pair)" did not throw
PASS invalid but not undefined arguments should not cause pipeThrough to throw 
PASS pipeThrough should throw when its first argument is not convertible to an object 
PASS pipeThrough should throw when "this" has no pipeTo method 
PASS pipeThrough should rethrow errors from accessing pipeTo, readable, or writable 
PASS pipeThrough should work with no options argument 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
