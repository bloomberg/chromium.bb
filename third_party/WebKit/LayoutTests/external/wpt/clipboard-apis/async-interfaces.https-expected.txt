PASS ClipboardEvent interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS ClipboardEvent interface: attribute clipboardData
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for clipboardData property on ClipboardEvent
PASS ClipboardEvent must be primary interface of new ClipboardEvent("x")
FAIL Stringification of new ClipboardEvent("x") Cannot read property 'has_stringifier' of undefined
PASS ClipboardEvent interface: new ClipboardEvent("x") must inherit property "clipboardData" with the proper type

PASS Clipboard interface: operation writeText(DOMString)
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for writeText(DOMString) on Clipboard
PASS Clipboard must be primary interface of navigator.clipboard
PASS Stringification of navigator.clipboard
PASS Clipboard interface: navigator.clipboard must inherit property "read()" with the proper type
PASS Clipboard interface: navigator.clipboard must inherit property "readText()" with the proper type
PASS Clipboard interface: navigator.clipboard must inherit property "write(DataTransfer)" with the proper type
PASS Clipboard interface: calling write(DataTransfer) on navigator.clipboard with too few arguments must throw TypeError
