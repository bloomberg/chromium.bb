PASS Storage must be primary interface of window.localStorage 
PASS Stringification of window.localStorage 
PASS Storage interface: window.localStorage must inherit property "length" with the proper type (0) 
PASS Storage interface: window.localStorage must inherit property "key" with the proper type (1) 
PASS Storage interface: calling key(unsigned long) on window.localStorage with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Storage interface: window.localStorage must inherit property "getItem" with the proper type (2) 
PASS Storage interface: calling getItem(DOMString) on window.localStorage with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Storage interface: window.localStorage must inherit property "setItem" with the proper type (3) 
PASS Storage interface: calling setItem(DOMString,DOMString) on window.localStorage with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Storage interface: window.localStorage must inherit property "removeItem" with the proper type (4) 
PASS Storage interface: calling removeItem(DOMString) on window.localStorage with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Storage interface: window.localStorage must inherit property "clear" with the proper type (5) 
PASS StorageEvent interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS StorageEvent interface object length 
PASS StorageEvent interface object name
