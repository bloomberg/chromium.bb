This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Reversing an animation inverts the playback rate
PASS Reversing an animation plays a pausing animation
PASS Reversing an animation maintains the same current time
PASS Reversing an animation does not cause it to leave the pending state
PASS Reversing an animation does not cause it to resolve the ready promise
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime > effect end should make it play from the end
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime < 0 should make it play from the end
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime < 0 should make it play from the start
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime > effect end should make it play from the start
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate > 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity should throw an exception
FAIL When reversing throws an exception, the playback rate remains unchangedassert_equals: playbackRate remains unchanged expected 1 but got -1
PASS Reversing animation when playbackRate = 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity should NOT throw an exception
PASS Reversing an animation when playbackRate < 0 and currentTime < 0 and the target effect end is positive infinity should make it play from the start
PASS Reversing when when playbackRate == 0 should preserve the current time and playback rate
FAIL Reversing an animation without an active timeline throws an InvalidStateErrorassert_throws: function "function () { animation.reverse(); }" did not throw
Harness: the test ran to completion.
