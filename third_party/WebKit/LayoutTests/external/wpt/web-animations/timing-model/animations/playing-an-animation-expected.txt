This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Playing a running animation leaves the current time unchanged
PASS Playing a finished animation seeks back to the start
PASS Playing a finished and reversed animation seeks to end
PASS Playing a pause-pending but previously finished animation seeks back to to the start
PASS Playing a finished animation clears the start time
PASS The ready promise should be replaced if the animation is not already pending
PASS A pending ready promise should be resolved and not replaced when the animation enters the running state
FAIL If a pause operation is interrupted, the ready promise is reused assert_true: Animation is pending expected true got undefined
FAIL A pending playback rate is used when determining auto-rewind behavior promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: animation.updatePlaybackRate is not a function"
