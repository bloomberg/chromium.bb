This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL accumulate onto the base value Failed to execute 'animate' on 'Element': Invalid composite value: 'accumulate'
FAIL accumulate onto an underlying animation value Failed to execute 'animate' on 'Element': Invalid composite value: 'accumulate'
FAIL Composite when mixing accumulate and replace Failed to execute 'animate' on 'Element': Invalid composite value: 'accumulate'
FAIL accumulate specified on a keyframe overrides the composite mode of the effect assert_equals: Animated style at 50% expected "20px" but got "15px"
FAIL unspecified composite mode on a keyframe is overriden by setting accumulate of the effect assert_equals: Animated style at 50% expected "20px" but got "15px"
PASS add onto the base value
PASS add onto an underlying animation value
PASS Composite when mixing add and replace
PASS add specified on a keyframe overrides the composite mode of the effect
PASS unspecified composite mode on a keyframe is overriden by setting add of the effect
Harness: the test ran to completion.
