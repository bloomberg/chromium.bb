This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL accumulate onto the base value assert_equals: Animated margin-left style at 50% expected "15px" but got "5px"
FAIL accumulate onto an underlying animation value assert_equals: Animated style at 50% expected "20px" but got "5px"
FAIL Composite when mixing accumulate and replace assert_equals: Animated style at 50% expected "25px" but got "20px"
FAIL accumulate specified on a keyframe overrides the composite mode of the effect Failed to execute 'animate' on 'Element': Invalid composite value: 'accumulate'
FAIL unspecified composite mode on a keyframe is overriden by setting accumulate of the effect assert_equals: Animated style at 50% expected "20px" but got "15px"
PASS add onto the base value
PASS add onto an underlying animation value
PASS Composite when mixing add and replace
PASS add specified on a keyframe overrides the composite mode of the effect
PASS unspecified composite mode on a keyframe is overriden by setting add of the effect
Harness: the test ran to completion.
