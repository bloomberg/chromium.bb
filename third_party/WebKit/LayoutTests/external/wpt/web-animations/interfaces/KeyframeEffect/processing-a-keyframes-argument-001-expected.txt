PASS Equivalent property-indexed and sequenced keyframes: two properties with one value
PASS Equivalent property-indexed and sequenced keyframes: two properties with three values
PASS Equivalent property-indexed and sequenced keyframes: two properties with different numbers of values
PASS Equivalent property-indexed and sequenced keyframes: same easing applied to all keyframes
PASS Equivalent property-indexed and sequenced keyframes: same composite applied to all keyframes
PASS Keyframes are read from a custom iterator
PASS 'easing' and 'offset' are ignored on iterable objects
PASS Keyframes are read from a custom iterator with multiple properties specified
PASS Keyframes are read from a custom iterator with where an offset is specified
PASS Reading from a custom iterator that returns a non-object keyframe should throw
FAIL A list of values returned from a custom iterator should be ignored Failed to construct 'KeyframeEffect': Lists of values not permitted in array-form list of keyframes
PASS Only enumerable properties on keyframes are read
FAIL Only properties defined directly on keyframes are read assert_equals: properties on ComputedKeyframe #0 should match expected "composite,computedOffset,easing,offset,top" but got "composite,computedOffset,easing,height,left,offset,top"
PASS Only enumerable properties on property-indexed keyframes are read
FAIL Only properties defined directly on property-indexed keyframes are read assert_equals: properties on ComputedKeyframe #0 should match expected "composite,computedOffset,easing,offset,top" but got "composite,computedOffset,easing,left,offset,top"
FAIL Properties are read in ascending order by Unicode codepoint assert_array_equals: property access order property 3, expected "left" but got "marginLeft"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
