This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL easing values are parsed correctly when set on a property-indexed keyframe effect.getKeyframes is not a function
FAIL easing values are parsed correctly when using a keyframe sequence effect.getKeyframes is not a function
PASS Invalid easing values are correctly rejected when set on a property-indexed keyframe
PASS Invalid easing values are correctly rejected when using a keyframe sequence
FAIL Errors from invalid easings on a property-indexed keyframe are thrown after reading all properties assert_equals: All properties were read before throwing the easing error expected 2 but got 0
FAIL Errors from invalid easings on a keyframe sequence are thrown after reading all properties assert_equals: All properties were read before throwing the easing error expected 4 but got 0
Harness: the test ran to completion.
