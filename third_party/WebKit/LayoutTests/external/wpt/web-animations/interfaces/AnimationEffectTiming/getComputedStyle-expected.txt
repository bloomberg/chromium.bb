This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS changed duration immediately updates its computed styles
PASS changed iterations immediately updates its computed styles
PASS change currentTime when fill is none and endDelay is positive
PASS change currentTime when fill forwards and endDelay is positive
PASS change currentTime when fill none and endDelay is negative
FAIL change currentTime when fill forwards and endDelay is negative assert_equals: set currentTime after endTime expected "0" but got "0.5"
PASS change direction from "normal" to "reverse"
PASS change direction from "normal" to "alternate"
PASS change direction from "normal" to "alternate-reverse"
PASS change direction from "normal" to "reverse" when currentTime is 0
Harness: the test ran to completion.
