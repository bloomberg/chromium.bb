<!--
This test relies on an undefined behavior and may fail if some
conditions do not stand.

The reference file of this test uses U+002D. Although `&shy;`
being rendered as U+002D is not defined, and most UA actually
use U+2010 when the font has a glyph for it, it looks like in
most common fonts the glyph for U+2010 and U+002D match, so
the use of U+002D seems to work in most cases.
