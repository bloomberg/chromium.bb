PASS Range interface: operation getClientRects()
PASS Range interface: operation getBoundingClientRect()
PASS Range interface: new Range() must inherit property "getClientRects()" with the proper type
PASS Range interface: new Range() must inherit property "getBoundingClientRect()" with the proper type
Harness: the test ran to completion.
