<style>
div {
  white-space: pre;
  font-family: monospace;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
  overflow: hidden;
  width: calc(5ch + 1px);
  /* 5ch ought to be enough,
     but Safari seems to have aliasing issues that make the ellipsis character larger than 1ch by a fraction of a pixel.
     Adding an extra 1px does not change the validity of the test,
     and lets safari fit “PASS…” in the space provided.
     This issue may be a bug, but if so, it is unrelated to what this test is testing,
     so no need to force a fail when an easy workaround is available.

     NB: At the time of writing, Safari fails the test anyway,
     but I want to make it possible for it to pass just by fixing what is relevant to CSS-UI.

span { float: right; }

<p>Test passes if “PASS…” appears below.</p>
<div><span>    </span>PASSfiller text to make things overflow</div>
