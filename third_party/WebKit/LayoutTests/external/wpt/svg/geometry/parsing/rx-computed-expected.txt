This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Property rx value 'auto' computes to 'auto'
PASS Property rx value '10px' computes to '10px'
PASS Property rx value '0.5em' computes to '20px'
PASS Property rx value 'calc(10px + 0.5em)' computes to '30px'
PASS Property rx value '40%' computes to '40%'
FAIL Property rx value 'calc(50% + 60x)' computes to 'calc(50% + 60x)' assert_equals: expected "calc(50% + 60x)" but got "auto"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
