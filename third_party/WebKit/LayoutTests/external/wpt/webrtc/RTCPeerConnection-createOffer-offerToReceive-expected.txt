This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL createOffer() with offerToReceiveAudio set to false should not create a transceiver promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: pc.getTransceivers is not a function"
FAIL createOffer() with offerToReceiveAudio should create a "recvonly" transceiver promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: pc.getTransceivers is not a function"
FAIL offerToReceiveAudio option should be ignored if a non-stopped "recvonly" transceiver exists promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: pc.getTransceivers is not a function"

FAIL offerToReceiveAudio set to false with a "recvonly" transceiver should change the direction to "inactive" pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL subsequent offerToReceiveAudio set to false with a track should change the direction to "sendonly" promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Only secure origins are allowed (see: https://goo.gl/Y0ZkNV)."

Harness: the test ran to completion.
