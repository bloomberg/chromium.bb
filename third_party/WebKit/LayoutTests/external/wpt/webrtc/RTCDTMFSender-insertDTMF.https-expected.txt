This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS insertDTMF() should succeed if tones contains valid DTMF characters
PASS insertDTMF() should throw InvalidCharacterError if tones contains invalid DTMF characters
FAIL insertDTMF() should throw InvalidStateError if transceiver is stopped pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL insertDTMF() should throw InvalidStateError if transceiver.currentDirection is recvonly pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL insertDTMF() should throw InvalidStateError if transceiver.currentDirection is inactive pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL insertDTMF() should set toneBuffer to provided tones normalized, with old tones overridden assert_equals: expected "123" but got "23"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
