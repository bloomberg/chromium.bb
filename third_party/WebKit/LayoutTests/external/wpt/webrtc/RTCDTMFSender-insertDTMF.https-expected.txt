This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL insertDTMF() should succeed if tones contains valid DTMF characters assert_true: Expect audio sender.dtmf to be set to a RTCDTMFSender expected true got false
FAIL insertDTMF() should throw InvalidCharacterError if tones contains invalid DTMF characters assert_true: Expect audio sender.dtmf to be set to a RTCDTMFSender expected true got false
FAIL insertDTMF() should throw InvalidStateError if transceiver is stopped pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL insertDTMF() should throw InvalidStateError if transceiver.currentDirection is recvonly pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL insertDTMF() should throw InvalidStateError if transceiver.currentDirection is inactive pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL insertDTMF() should set toneBuffer to provided tones normalized, with old tones overridden assert_true: Expect audio sender.dtmf to be set to a RTCDTMFSender expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
