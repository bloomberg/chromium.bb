FAIL setCodecPreferences() with both sender receiver codecs combined should succeedpc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setCodecPreferences([]) should succeedpc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with reordered codecs should succeedpc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setCodecPreferences() on audio transceiver with codecs returned from getCapabilities('video') should throw InvalidAccessErrorpc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with user defined codec should throw InvalidAccessErrorpc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with user defined codec together with codecs returned from getCapabilities() should throw InvalidAccessErrorpc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setCodecPreferences() with modified codecs returned from getCapabilities() should throw InvalidAccessErrorpc.addTransceiver is not a function
Harness: the test ran to completion.
