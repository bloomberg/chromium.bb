This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS insertDTMF() with default duration and intertoneGap should fire tonechange events at the expected time
PASS insertDTMF() with explicit duration and intertoneGap should fire tonechange events at the expected time
FAIL insertDTMF('') should not fire any tonechange event, including for '' tone assert_unreached: Expect no tonechange event to be fired Reached unreachable code
PASS insertDTMF() with duration less than 40 should be clamped to 40
PASS insertDTMF() with interToneGap less than 30 should be clamped to 30
PASS insertDTMF with comma should delay next tonechange event for a constant 2000ms
FAIL insertDTMF() with transceiver stopped in the middle should stop future tonechange events from firing assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: TypeError: pc.getTransceivers is not a function Reached unreachable code
PASS Calling insertDTMF() in the middle of tonechange events should cause future tonechanges to be updated to new tones
FAIL Calling insertDTMF() multiple times in the middle of tonechange events should cause future tonechanges to be updated the last provided tones assert_equals: Expect current event.tone to be 3 expected "3" but got "1"
PASS Calling insertDTMF('') in the middle of tonechange events should stop future tonechange events from firing
FAIL Setting transceiver.currentDirection to recvonly in the middle of tonechange events should stop future tonechange events from firing pc.addTransceiver is not a function
Harness: the test ran to completion.
