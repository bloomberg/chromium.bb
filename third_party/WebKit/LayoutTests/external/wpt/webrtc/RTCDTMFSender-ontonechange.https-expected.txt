This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL insertDTMF() with default duration and intertoneGap should fire tonechange events at the expected time assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: ReferenceError: RTCDTMFSender is not defined Reached unreachable code
FAIL insertDTMF() with explicit duration and intertoneGap should fire tonechange events at the expected time assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: ReferenceError: RTCDTMFSender is not defined Reached unreachable code
FAIL insertDTMF('') should not fire any tonechange event, including for '' tone assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: ReferenceError: RTCDTMFSender is not defined Reached unreachable code
FAIL insertDTMF() with duration less than 40 should be clamped to 40 assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: ReferenceError: RTCDTMFSender is not defined Reached unreachable code
FAIL insertDTMF() with interToneGap less than 30 should be clamped to 30 assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: ReferenceError: RTCDTMFSender is not defined Reached unreachable code
FAIL insertDTMF with comma should delay next tonechange event for a constant 2000ms assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: ReferenceError: RTCDTMFSender is not defined Reached unreachable code
FAIL insertDTMF() with transceiver stopped in the middle should stop future tonechange events from firing assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: ReferenceError: RTCDTMFSender is not defined Reached unreachable code
FAIL Calling insertDTMF() in the middle of tonechange events should cause future tonechanges to be updated to new tones assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: ReferenceError: RTCDTMFSender is not defined Reached unreachable code
FAIL Calling insertDTMF() multiple times in the middle of tonechange events should cause future tonechanges to be updated the last provided tones assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: ReferenceError: RTCDTMFSender is not defined Reached unreachable code
FAIL Calling insertDTMF('') in the middle of tonechange events should stop future tonechange events from firing assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: ReferenceError: RTCDTMFSender is not defined Reached unreachable code
FAIL Setting transceiver.currentDirection to recvonly in the middle of tonechange events should stop future tonechange events from firing pc.addTransceiver is not a function
