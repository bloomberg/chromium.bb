This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Calling removeTrack when connection is closed should throw InvalidStateError assert_own_property: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method expected property "addTransceiver" missing
FAIL Calling removeTrack on different connection that is closed should throw InvalidStateError assert_own_property: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method expected property "addTransceiver" missing
FAIL Calling removeTrack on different connection should throw InvalidAccessError assert_own_property: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method expected property "addTransceiver" missing
FAIL Calling removeTrack with valid sender should set sender.track to null assert_own_property: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method expected property "addTransceiver" missing
FAIL Calling removeTrack with currentDirection sendrecv should set direction to recvonly assert_own_property: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method expected property "addTransceiver" missing
FAIL Calling removeTrack with currentDirection sendonly should set direction to inactive assert_own_property: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method expected property "addTransceiver" missing
FAIL Calling removeTrack with currentDirection recvonly should not change direction assert_own_property: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method expected property "addTransceiver" missing
FAIL Calling removeTrack with currentDirection inactive should not change direction assert_own_property: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method expected property "addTransceiver" missing
Harness: the test ran to completion.
