This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL addTransceiver - Calling removeTrack when connection is closed should throw InvalidStateErrorassert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL addTrack - Calling removeTrack when connection is closed should throw InvalidStateErrorpromise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Only secure origins are allowed (see: https://goo.gl/Y0ZkNV)."
FAIL addTransceiver - Calling removeTrack on different connection that is closed should throw InvalidStateErrorassert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
