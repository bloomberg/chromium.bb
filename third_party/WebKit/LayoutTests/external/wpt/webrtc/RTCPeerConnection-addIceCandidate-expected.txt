FAIL Adding multiple candidates should add candidates to their corresponding media stream promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: TEST_ERROR"
FAIL Add with empty candidate string (end of candidate) should succeed promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: TEST_ERROR"
FAIL Add candidate with both sdpMid and sdpMLineIndex manually set to null should reject with TypeError promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "OperationError: TEST_ERROR"
