This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setRemoteDescription should trigger ontrack event when the MSID of the stream is is parsed. assert_true: Expect trackEvent.transceiver to be defined and is instance of RTCRtpTransceiver expected true got false
PASS setRemoteDescription() with m= line of recvonly direction should not trigger track event
FAIL addTrack() should cause remote connection to fire ontrack when setRemoteDescription() assert_true: Expect trackEvent.transceiver to be defined and is instance of RTCRtpTransceiver expected true got false
FAIL addTransceiver('video') should cause remote connection to fire ontrack when setRemoteDescription() pc1.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL addTransceiver() with inactive direction should not cause remote connection to fire ontrack when setRemoteDescription() pc1.addTransceiver is not a function
Harness: the test ran to completion.
