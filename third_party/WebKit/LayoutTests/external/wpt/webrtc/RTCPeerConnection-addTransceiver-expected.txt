This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL addTransceiver() with string argument as invalid kind should throw TypeError assert_own_property: expected property "addTransceiver" missing
FAIL addTransceiver('audio') should return an audio transceiver assert_own_property: expected property "addTransceiver" missing
FAIL addTransceiver('video') should return a video transceiver assert_own_property: expected property "addTransceiver" missing
FAIL addTransceiver() with direction sendonly should have result transceiver.direction be the same pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL addTransceiver() with direction inactive should have result transceiver.direction be the same pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL addTransceiver() with invalid direction should throw TypeError assert_own_property: expected property "addTransceiver" missing
FAIL addTransceiver(track) should have result with sender.track be given track assert_own_property: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method expected property "addTransceiver" missing
FAIL addTransceiver(track) multiple times should create multiple transceivers assert_own_property: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method expected property "addTransceiver" missing
Harness: the test ran to completion.
