This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL addTransceiver() with string argument as invalid kind should throw TypeError assert_idl_attribute: property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL addTransceiver('audio') should return an audio transceiver assert_idl_attribute: property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL addTransceiver('video') should return a video transceiver assert_idl_attribute: property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL addTransceiver() with direction sendonly should have result transceiver.direction be the same pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL addTransceiver() with direction inactive should have result transceiver.direction be the same pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL addTransceiver() with invalid direction should throw TypeError assert_idl_attribute: property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL addTransceiver(track) should have result with sender.track be given track assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL addTransceiver(track) multiple times should create multiple transceivers assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL addTransceiver() with rid containing invalid non-alphanumeric characters should throw TypeError assert_idl_attribute: property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL addTransceiver() with rid longer than 16 characters should throw TypeError assert_idl_attribute: property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
