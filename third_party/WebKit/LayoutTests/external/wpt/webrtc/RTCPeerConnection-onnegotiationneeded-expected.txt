This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Creating first data channel should fire negotiationneeded event
PASS calling createDataChannel twice should fire negotiationneeded event once
FAIL addTransceiver() should fire negotiationneeded event pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL Calling addTransceiver() twice should fire negotiationneeded event once pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL Calling both addTransceiver() and createDataChannel() should fire negotiationneeded event once assert_unreached: Pending promise should never be resolved. Instead it is rejected with: TypeError: pc.addTransceiver is not a function Reached unreachable code
PASS negotiationneeded event should not fire if signaling state is not stable
FAIL negotiationneeded event should fire only after signaling state go back to stable assert_unreached: Expect negotiationneeded promise to resolve after pc has set remote answer and go back to stable state Reached unreachable code
Harness: the test ran to completion.
