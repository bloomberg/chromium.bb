This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL addTransceiver - Calling removeTrack when connection is closed should throw InvalidStateError assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
PASS addTrack - Calling removeTrack when connection is closed should throw InvalidStateError
FAIL addTransceiver - Calling removeTrack on different connection that is closed should throw InvalidStateError assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
PASS addTrack - Calling removeTrack on different connection that is closed should throw InvalidStateError
FAIL addTransceiver - Calling removeTrack on different connection should throw InvalidAccessError assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
PASS addTrack - Calling removeTrack on different connection should throw InvalidAccessError
FAIL addTransceiver - Calling removeTrack with valid sender should set sender.track to null assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
PASS addTrack - Calling removeTrack with valid sender should set sender.track to null
FAIL Calling removeTrack with currentDirection sendrecv should set direction to recvonly assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling removeTrack with currentDirection sendonly should set direction to inactive assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling removeTrack with currentDirection recvonly should not change direction assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling removeTrack with currentDirection inactive should not change direction assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
Harness: the test ran to completion.
