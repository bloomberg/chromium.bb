PASS setRemoteDescription() with m= line of recvonly direction should not trigger track event
FAIL addTrack() should cause remote connection to fire ontrack when setRemoteDescription() assert_unreached: Error NotSupportedError: Only secure origins are allowed (see: https://goo.gl/Y0ZkNV). Reached unreachable code
FAIL addTransceiver('video') should cause remote connection to fire ontrack when setRemoteDescription() pc1.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL addTransceiver() with inactive direction should not cause remote connection to fire ontrack when setRemoteDescription() pc1.addTransceiver is not a function
