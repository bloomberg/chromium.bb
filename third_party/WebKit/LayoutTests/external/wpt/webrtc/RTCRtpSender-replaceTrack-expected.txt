This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Calling replaceTrack on closed connection should reject with InvalidStateErrorassert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack with track of different kind should reject with TypeErrorassert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack on stopped sender should reject with InvalidStateErrorassert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack on sender with null track and not set to session description should resolve with sender.track set to given trackassert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack on sender not set to session description should resolve with sender.track set to given trackassert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack(null) on sender not set to session description should resolve with sender.track set to nullassert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack(null) on sender set to session description should resolve with sender.track set to nullassert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack on sender with stopped track and and set to session description should resolve with sender.track set to given trackassert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack on sender with similar track and and set to session description should resolve with sender.track set to new trackassert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
Harness: the test ran to completion.
