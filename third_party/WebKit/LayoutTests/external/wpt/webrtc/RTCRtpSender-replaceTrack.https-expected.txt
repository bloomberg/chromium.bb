This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Calling replaceTrack on closed connection should reject with InvalidStateError assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack with track of different kind should reject with TypeError assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack on stopped sender should reject with InvalidStateError assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack on sender with null track and not set to session description should resolve with sender.track set to given track assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack on sender not set to session description should resolve with sender.track set to given track assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack(null) on sender not set to session description should resolve with sender.track set to null assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack(null) on sender set to session description should resolve with sender.track set to null assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack on sender with stopped track and and set to session description should resolve with sender.track set to given track assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL Calling replaceTrack on sender with similar track and and set to session description should resolve with sender.track set to new track assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
Harness: the test ran to completion.
