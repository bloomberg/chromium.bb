FAIL setLocalDescription(offer) with m= section should assign mid to corresponding transceiver pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setRemoteDescription(offer) with m= section and no existing transceiver should create corresponding transceiver pc1.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) should unset transceiver.mid pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) should only unset transceiver mids associated with current round pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setRemoteDescription(rollback) should remove newly created transceiver from transceiver list pc1.addTransceiver is not a function
