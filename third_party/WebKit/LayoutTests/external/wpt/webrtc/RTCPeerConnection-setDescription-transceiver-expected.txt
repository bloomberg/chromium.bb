This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setLocalDescription(offer) with m= section should assign mid to corresponding transceiverpc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setRemoteDescription(offer) with m= section and no existing transceiver should create corresponding transceiverpc1.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) should unset transceiver.midpc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setLocalDescription(rollback) should only unset transceiver mids associated with current roundpc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL setRemoteDescription(rollback) should remove newly created transceiver from transceiver listpc1.addTransceiver is not a function
