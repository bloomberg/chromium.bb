This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS getStats() with no argument should succeed
FAIL getStats(null) should succeed promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'getStats' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The callback provided as parameter 1 is not a function."
FAIL getStats() with track not added to connection should reject with InvalidAccessError assert_throws: function "function () { throw e }" threw object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'getStats' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The callback provided as parameter 1 is not a function." that is not a DOMException InvalidAccessError: property "code" is equal to undefined, expected 15
FAIL getStats() with track added via addTrack should succeed promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'getStats' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The callback provided as parameter 1 is not a function."
FAIL getStats() with track added via addTransceiver should succeed assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL getStats() with track associated with more than one sender should reject with InvalidAccessError promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: pc.addTransceiver is not a function"
FAIL getStats() with track associated with both sender and receiver should reject with InvalidAccessError pc.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL getStats() with no argument should return stats report containing peer-connection stats assert_equals: Expect dictionary.timeStamp to be number expected "number" but got "undefined"
FAIL getStats() on track associated with RtpSender should return stats report containing outbound-rtp stats promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'getStats' on 'RTCPeerConnection': The callback provided as parameter 1 is not a function."
FAIL getStats() on track associated with RtpReceiver should return stats report containing inbound-rtp stats pc.addTransceiver is not a function
Harness: the test ran to completion.
