This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS addTrack when pc is closed should throw InvalidStateError
FAIL addTrack with single track argument and no stream should succeed promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: pc.getTransceivers is not a function"
PASS addTrack with single track argument and single stream should succeed
FAIL addTrack with single track argument and multiple streams should succeed promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'addTrack' on 'RTCPeerConnection': Adding a track to multiple streams is not supported."
PASS Adding the same track multiple times should throw InvalidAccessError
FAIL addTrack with existing sender with null track, same kind, and recvonly direction should reuse sender promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: pc.addTransceiver is not a function"
FAIL addTrack with existing sender that has not been used to send should reuse the sender promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: pc.addTransceiver is not a function"
FAIL addTrack with existing sender that has been used to send should create new sender assert_idl_attribute: Expect pc to have addTransceiver() method property "addTransceiver" not found in prototype chain
FAIL addTrack with existing sender with null track, different kind, and recvonly direction should create new sender promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: pc.addTransceiver is not a function"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
