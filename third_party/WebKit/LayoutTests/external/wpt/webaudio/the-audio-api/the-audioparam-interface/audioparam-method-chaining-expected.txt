PASS # AUDIT TASK RUNNER STARTED.
PASS > [from-dictionary] 
PASS   The return value of AudioParam.setValueAtTime() matches the source AudioParam is equal to true.
PASS   The return value of AudioParam.linearRampToValueAtTime() matches the source AudioParam is equal to true.
PASS   The return value of AudioParam.exponentialRampToValueAtTime() matches the source AudioParam is equal to true.
PASS   The return value of AudioParam.setTargetAtTime() matches the source AudioParam is equal to true.
PASS   The return value of AudioParam.setValueCurveAtTime() matches the source AudioParam is equal to true.
PASS   The return value of AudioParam.cancelScheduledValues() matches the source AudioParam is equal to true.
PASS < [from-dictionary] All assertions passed. (total 6 assertions)
PASS > [invalid-operation] 
FAIL X Calling setValueAtTime() with a negative end time threw "RangeError" instead of RangeError. assert_true: expected true got false
FAIL X Calling exponentialRampToValueAtTime() with a zero target value threw "RangeError" instead of RangeError. assert_true: expected true got false
PASS   The gain value of the first gain node is equal to 1.
PASS   The gain value of the second gain node is equal to 0.5.
FAIL < [invalid-operation] 2 out of 4 assertions were failed. assert_true: expected true got false
PASS > [verification] 
PASS   The rendered envelope equals [0,0.000125,0.00025,0.000375,0.0005,0.000625,0.00075,0.000875,0.001,0.001125,0.00125,0.001375,0.0015,0.001625,0.00175,0.001875...] with an element-wise tolerance of {"absoluteThreshold":0.0000040532,"relativeThreshold":0}.
PASS < [verification] All assertions passed. (total 1 assertions)
FAIL # AUDIT TASK RUNNER FINISHED: 1 out of 3 tasks were failed. assert_true: expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
