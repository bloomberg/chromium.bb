This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Test driver
PASS Window interface: attribute performance
PASS Window interface: window must inherit property "performance" with the proper type
PASS WorkerGlobalScope interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS SharedWorkerGlobalScope interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS WorkerNavigator interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS WorkerLocation interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS Performance interface object length
PASS Performance interface object name
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS Performance interface: operation now()
PASS Performance interface: attribute timeOrigin
PASS Performance interface: operation toJSON()
PASS Performance must be primary interface of window.performance
PASS Stringification of window.performance
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "now()" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "timeOrigin" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "toJSON()" with the proper type
FAIL Test default toJSON operation of Performance assert_true: property "timeOrigin" should be present in the output of Performance.prototype.toJSON() expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
