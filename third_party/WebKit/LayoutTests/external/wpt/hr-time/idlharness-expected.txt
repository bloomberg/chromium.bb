This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Test driver promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "Error: undefined EventTarget not found (inherited by Performance)"
FAIL Performance interface: existence and properties of interface object Cannot read property 'has_extended_attribute' of undefined
PASS Performance interface object length
PASS Performance interface object name
FAIL Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object Cannot read property 'has_extended_attribute' of undefined
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS Performance interface: operation now()
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for now() on Performance
PASS Performance interface: attribute timeOrigin
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for timeOrigin property on Performance
PASS Performance interface: operation toJSON()
PASS Unscopable handled correctly for toJSON() on Performance
PASS Performance must be primary interface of window.performance
FAIL Stringification of window.performance Cannot read property 'has_stringifier' of undefined
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "now()" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "timeOrigin" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "toJSON()" with the proper type
Harness: the test ran to completion.
