This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Window interface: attribute performance
PASS WorkerGlobalScope interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS Performance interface object length
PASS Performance interface object name
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS Performance interface: operation now()
PASS Performance interface: operation toJSON()
PASS Performance must be primary interface of window.performance
PASS Stringification of window.performance
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "now()" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "toJSON()" with the proper type
FAIL Test default toJSON operation of Performance assert_unreached: property "timing" should not be present in the output of Performance.prototype.toJSON() Reached unreachable code
Harness: the test ran to completion.
