This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL document.open should redirect to window.open when called with three arguments assert_unreached: The call should be redirected to the real window.open Reached unreachable code
FAIL document.open should throw when it has no window and is called with three arguments assert_throws: function "function () {
    doc.open("/resources/testharness.js", "", "");
  }" did not throw
Harness: the test ran to completion.
