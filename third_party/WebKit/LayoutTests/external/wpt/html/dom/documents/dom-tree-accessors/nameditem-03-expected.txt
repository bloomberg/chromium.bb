This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL If there is one applet, it should be returned (name) assert_equals: expected (string) "test1" but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL If there are two applets, a collection should be returned. (name) assert_equals: expected (string) "test2" but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL If there is one applet, it should be returned (id) assert_true: "test3" in document should be true expected true got false
FAIL If there are two applets, a collection should be returned. (id) assert_true: "test4" in document should be true expected true got false
FAIL If there are two applets, a collection should be returned. (name and id) assert_equals: expected (string) "test5" but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL If there are two applets, a collection should be returned. (id and name) assert_equals: expected (string) "test6" but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL A name shouldn't affect getting an applet by id assert_true: "test7" in document should be true expected true got false
FAIL An id shouldn't affect getting an applet by name assert_equals: expected (string) "test8" but got (undefined) undefined
