This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS close() fires a close event
FAIL close() on a <dialog> that doesn't have an open attribute aborts the steps Failed to execute 'close' on 'HTMLDialogElement': The element does not have an 'open' attribute, and therefore cannot be closed.
PASS close() removes the open attribute and set the returnValue to the first argument
PASS close() without argument removes the open attribute and there's no returnValue
PASS close() should set the returnValue IDL attribute but not the JS property
Harness: the test ran to completion.
