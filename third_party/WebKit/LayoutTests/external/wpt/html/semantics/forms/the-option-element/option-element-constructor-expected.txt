This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Option constructor with no arguments assert_false: expected false got true
PASS Option constructor with falsy arguments 
PASS Option constructor creates HTMLOptionElement with specified text and value 
PASS Option constructor handles selectedness correctly when specified with defaultSelected only 
PASS Option constructor handles selectedness correctly, even when incongruous with defaultSelected 
FAIL Option constructor treats undefined text and value correctly assert_false: expected false got true
PASS Option constructor treats falsy selected and defaultSelected correctly 
PASS Option constructor treats truthy selected and defaultSelected correctly 
PASS Option constructor does not set dirtiness (so, manipulating the selected content attribute still updates the selected IDL attribute) 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
