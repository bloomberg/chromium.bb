This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Indeterminate progress bar should have position -1
PASS Revoming the value attribute makes an intermediate progress bar, which should have position -1
PASS Determinate progress bar should have fractional position
PASS Indeterminate progress bar should have value 0
FAIL Value must equal max if the parsed value is larger than max assert_array_equals: value is 1, expected array
PASS Max must be 1 by default
FAIL Max must be 1 by default, even if value is specified assert_array_equals: value is 1, expected array
PASS Max must be 1 if max value is invalid
PASS Max must be 1 if the parsed max value is less than or equal to zero
PASS Value must be 0 if value is invalid
PASS Value must be 0 if the parsed value is less than or equal to zero
Harness: the test ran to completion.
