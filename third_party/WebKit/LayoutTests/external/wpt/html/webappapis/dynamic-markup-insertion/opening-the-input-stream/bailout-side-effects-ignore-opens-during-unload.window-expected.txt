FAIL document.open bailout should not have any side effects (ignore-opens-during-unload is greater than 0 during unload event) assert_not_equals: document nodes should not be cleared (ignore-opens-during-unload counter is greater than 0 during unload event) got disallowed value 0
FAIL document.open bailout should not have any side effects (ignore-opens-during-unload is greater than 0 during beforeunload event) assert_not_equals: document nodes should not be cleared (ignore-opens-during-unload counter is greater than 0 during beforeunload event) got disallowed value 0
FAIL document.open bailout should not have any side effects (ignore-opens-during-unload is greater than 0 during pagehide event) assert_not_equals: document nodes should not be cleared (ignore-opens-during-unload counter is greater than 0 during pagehide event) got disallowed value 0
