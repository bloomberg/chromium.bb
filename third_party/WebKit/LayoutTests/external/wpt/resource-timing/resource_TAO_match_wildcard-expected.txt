FAIL redirectStart, redirectEnd, domainLookupStart, domainLookupEnd, connectStart, connectEnd, secureConnectionStart, requestStart, and responseStart -- should NOT be all returned as 0 when the Timing-Allow-Origin header value list contains a wildcard ("*") and TAO algorithm passes assert_true: redirectStart, redirectEnd, domainLookupStart, domainLookupEnd, connectStart, connectEnd, secureConnectionStart, requestStart, and responseStart -- should NOT be all returned as 0 when the Timing-Allow-Origin header value list contains a wildcard ("*") and TAO algorithm passes expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
