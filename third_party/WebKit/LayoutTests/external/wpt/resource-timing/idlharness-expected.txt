This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Performance interface: operation clearResourceTimings()
PASS Performance interface: operation setResourceTimingBufferSize(unsigned long)
PASS Performance interface: attribute onresourcetimingbufferfull
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "clearResourceTimings()" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "setResourceTimingBufferSize(unsigned long)" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: calling setResourceTimingBufferSize(unsigned long) on window.performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError
PASS Performance interface: window.performance must inherit property "onresourcetimingbufferfull" with the proper type
PASS PerformanceResourceTiming interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS PerformanceResourceTiming interface object length
PASS PerformanceResourceTiming interface object name
PASS PerformanceResourceTiming interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
