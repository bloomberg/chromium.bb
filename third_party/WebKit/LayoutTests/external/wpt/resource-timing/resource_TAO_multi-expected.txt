FAIL redirectStart, redirectEnd, domainLookupStart, domainLookupEnd, connectStart, connectEnd, secureConnectionStart, requestStart, and responseStart -- should not be all returned as 0 when the HTTP response has multiple Timing-Allow-Origin header fields and the subsequent field value is separated by a comma, i.e. TAO algorithm passes assert_true: redirectStart, redirectEnd, domainLookupStart, domainLookupEnd, connectStart, connectEnd, secureConnectionStart, requestStart, and responseStart -- should not be all returned as 0 when the HTTP response has multiple Timing-Allow-Origin header fields and the subsequent field value is separated by a comma, i.e. TAO algorithm passes expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
