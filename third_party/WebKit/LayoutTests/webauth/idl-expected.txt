PASS WebAuthentication interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
PASS WebAuthentication interface: operation makeCredential(MakeCredentialOptions) 
PASS WebAuthentication interface: operation getAssertion(PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions) 
PASS WebAuthentication must be primary interface of navigator.authentication 
PASS Stringification of navigator.authentication 
PASS WebAuthentication interface: navigator.authentication must inherit property "makeCredential" with the proper type (0) 
PASS WebAuthentication interface: calling makeCredential(MakeCredentialOptions) on navigator.authentication with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS WebAuthentication interface: navigator.authentication must inherit property "getAssertion" with the proper type (1) 
PASS WebAuthentication interface: calling getAssertion(PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions) on navigator.authentication with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
Harness: the test ran to completion.
