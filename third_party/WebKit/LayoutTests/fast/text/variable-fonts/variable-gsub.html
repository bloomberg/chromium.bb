<!-- The variabletest_box font has an r glyph that says "rvrn base" and has
     this as a name as well. And it has a glyph for R that says "rvrn subst"
     where rvrn stands for the required Required Variation Alternates
     feature. The font has an 'fvtt' axis ranging from 0 to 10, where it uses
     a single substitution glyph lookup table for axis values starting from
     5, which then replaces the rvrn_base glyph with the rvrn_subst
     glyph. So in this reftest the substituted glyph for lowercase r
     should visually match the uppercase R glyph, both show "rvrn subst". -->
