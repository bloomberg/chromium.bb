<!-- The variabletest_box font has an A glyph that looks like a lower half box,
  with deltas on the 'UPWD' variation axis that allow shifting the box up. At
  350, the box is at the top. The font also has two glyphs for UPPER HALF BLOCK
  and LOWER HALF BLOCK, which look identical to the respective variations of A.
