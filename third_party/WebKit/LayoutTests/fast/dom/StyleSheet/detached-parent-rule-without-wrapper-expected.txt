Test that CSS stylesheets lacking wrappers are pruned from detached CSSOM subtrees. This is surprising behavior, but it's a very rare situation, and the behavior actually matches what both WebKit and Gecko do for DOM nodes in detached subtrees.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS getMatchedCSSRules(document.getElementById("test")).length is 1
Removing <style>...
PASS rule.parentRule is null
PASS getMatchedCSSRules(document.getElementById("test")) is null
PASS successfullyParsed is true
