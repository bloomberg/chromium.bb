TEST COMPLETE
This test measures the time taken to fire a 100ms DOM Timer when the page visibility is set to "visible", "hidden", "visible", "prerender" and then back to "visible". Due to page timer throttling, the timer should fire close to 1s when page is hidden or prerender. And it should fire close to 100ms, when the page is visible.
