CONSOLE WARNING: line 113: 'window.webkitStorageInfo' is deprecated. Please use 'navigator.webkitTemporaryStorage' or 'navigator.webkitPersistentStorage' instead.
Tests property access on a cached DOMWindow after the associated frame is no longer in a web page. Test should not crash and properties should be set to sane defaults.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
