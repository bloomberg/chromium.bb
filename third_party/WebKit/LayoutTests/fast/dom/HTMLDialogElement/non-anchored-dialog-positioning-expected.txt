Tests positioning of non-anchored dialogs.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Dialog should be centered in the viewport.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

The computed top and bottom of a centered dialog should still have position auto
PASS window.getComputedStyle(dialog).top is "auto"
PASS window.getComputedStyle(dialog).bottom is "auto"

Dialog should be recentered if show() is called after close().
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Dialog should not be recentered on a relayout.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

A tall dialog should be positioned at the top of the viewport.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is 0
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is 0

The dialog should be centered regardless of the presence of a horizontal scrollbar.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Test that centering works when dialog is inside positioned containers.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Dialog's position should survive after becoming display:none temporarily.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Dialog's position should survive after being re-added to document without another call to show().
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Dialog's position should survive after close() and show().
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Dialog's position should survive after close() and manually reopen.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Dialog is recentered if show() is called after removing 'open'
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Dialog should not be centered if show() was called when an ancestor had display 'none'.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Test that setting 'top' on dialog results in the same position as for a plain, absolutely positioned span.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Test that setting 'bottom' on dialog results in the same position as for a plain, absolutely positioned span.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().bottom is plainSpan.getBoundingClientRect().bottom
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().bottom is plainSpan.getBoundingClientRect().bottom

Test that fixed positioning for dialog has same behavior as for a plain span.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is plainSpan.getBoundingClientRect().top
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is plainSpan.getBoundingClientRect().top

Test that static position for a non-modal dialog has the same behavior as for a plain span.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop

Test that relative position for a non-modal dialog has the same behavior as for a plain span.
PASS dialog.getBoundingClientRect().top is expectedTop
PASS successfullyParsed is true
