This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS addTransceiver() with string argument as invalid kind should throw TypeError
FAIL addTransceiver('audio') should return an audio transceiver assert_equals: expected true but got false
FAIL addTransceiver('video') should return a video transceiver assert_equals: expected true but got false
PASS addTransceiver() with direction sendonly should have result transceiver.direction be the same
PASS addTransceiver() with direction inactive should have result transceiver.direction be the same
PASS addTransceiver() with invalid direction should throw TypeError
FAIL addTransceiver(track) should have result with sender.track be given track assert_equals: expected true but got false
PASS addTransceiver(track) multiple times should create multiple transceivers
FAIL addTransceiver() with rid containing invalid non-alphanumeric characters should throw TypeError assert_throws: function "() =>
      pc.addTransceiver('audio', {
        sendEncodings: [{
          rid: '@Invalid!'
        }]
      })" did not throw
FAIL addTransceiver() with rid longer than 16 characters should throw TypeError assert_throws: function "() =>
      pc.addTransceiver('audio', {
        sendEncodings: [{
          rid: 'a'.repeat(17)
        }]
      })" did not throw
PASS addTransceiver() with valid rid value should succeed
FAIL addTransceiver() with readonly ssrc set should throw InvalidAccessError assert_throws: function "() =>
      pc.addTransceiver('audio', {
        sendEncodings: [{
          ssrc: 2
        }]
      })" did not throw
FAIL addTransceiver() with readonly rtx set should throw InvalidAccessError assert_throws: function "() =>
      pc.addTransceiver('audio', {
        sendEncodings: [{
          rtx: {
            ssrc: 2
          }

      })" did not throw
FAIL addTransceiver() with readonly fec set should throw InvalidAccessError assert_throws: function "() =>
      pc.addTransceiver('audio', {
        sendEncodings: [{
          fec: {
            ssrc: 2
          }
        }]
      })" did not throw
PASS addTransceiver() with valid sendEncodings should succeed
Harness: the test ran to completion.
