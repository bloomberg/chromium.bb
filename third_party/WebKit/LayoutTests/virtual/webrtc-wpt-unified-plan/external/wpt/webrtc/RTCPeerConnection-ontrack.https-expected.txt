This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setRemoteDescription should trigger ontrack event when the MSID of the stream is is parsed. RTCRtpTransceiver is not defined
FAIL setRemoteDescription() with m= line of recvonly direction should not trigger track event assert_unreached: ontrack event should not fire for track with recvonly direction Reached unreachable code
FAIL addTrack() should cause remote connection to fire ontrack when setRemoteDescription() RTCRtpTransceiver is not defined
FAIL addTransceiver('video') should cause remote connection to fire ontrack when setRemoteDescription() pc1.addTransceiver is not a function
FAIL addTransceiver() with inactive direction should not cause remote connection to fire ontrack when setRemoteDescription() pc1.addTransceiver is not a function
