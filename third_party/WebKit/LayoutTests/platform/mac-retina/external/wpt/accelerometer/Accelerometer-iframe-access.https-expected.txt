This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Accelerometer: sensor is suspended and resumed when focus traverses from to cross-origin frame
FAIL Accelerometer: sensor is not suspended when focus traverses from to same-origin frame assert_true: Not expecting event, but got reading event expected true got false
FAIL LinearAccelerationSensor: sensor is suspended and resumed when focus traverses from to cross-origin frame promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "Error: Call reset() before initialize()."
FAIL LinearAccelerationSensor: sensor is not suspended when focus traverses from to same-origin frame promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "Error: Call reset() before initialize()."
FAIL GravitySensor: sensor is suspended and resumed when focus traverses from to cross-origin frame promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "Error: Call reset() before initialize()."
FAIL GravitySensor: sensor is not suspended when focus traverses from to same-origin frame promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "Error: Call reset() before initialize()."
Harness: the test ran to completion.
