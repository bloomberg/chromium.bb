This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Window interface: attribute sessionStorage 
PASS Window interface: attribute localStorage 
PASS Storage interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS Storage interface object length 
PASS Storage interface object name 
PASS Storage interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object 
PASS Storage interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
FAIL Storage interface: attribute length assert_true: property should be enumerable expected true got false
FAIL Storage interface: operation key(unsigned long) assert_true: property should be enumerable expected true got false
FAIL Storage interface: operation getItem(DOMString) assert_true: property should be enumerable expected true got false
FAIL Storage interface: operation setItem(DOMString, DOMString) assert_true: property should be enumerable expected true got false
FAIL Storage interface: operation removeItem(DOMString) assert_true: property should be enumerable expected true got false

PASS Storage must be primary interface of window.localStorage 
PASS Stringification of window.localStorage 
PASS Storage interface: window.localStorage must inherit property "length" with the proper type 
PASS Storage interface: window.localStorage must inherit property "key(unsigned long)" with the proper type 
PASS Storage interface: calling key(unsigned long) on window.localStorage with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Storage interface: window.localStorage must inherit property "getItem(DOMString)" with the proper type 
PASS Storage interface: calling getItem(DOMString) on window.localStorage with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Storage interface: window.localStorage must inherit property "setItem(DOMString, DOMString)" with the proper type 
PASS Storage interface: calling setItem(DOMString, DOMString) on window.localStorage with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Storage interface: window.localStorage must inherit property "removeItem(DOMString)" with the proper type 
PASS Storage interface: calling removeItem(DOMString) on window.localStorage with too few arguments must throw TypeError 
PASS Storage interface: window.localStorage must inherit property "clear()" with the proper type 
PASS StorageEvent interface: existence and properties of interface object 
PASS StorageEvent interface object length 
PASS StorageEvent interface object name 
PASS StorageEvent interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object 
PASS StorageEvent interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property 
PASS StorageEvent interface: attribute key
