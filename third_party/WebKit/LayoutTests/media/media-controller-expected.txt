 
Test presence of MediaController constructor, controller, and mediaGroup attributes:
EXPECTED (typeof(MediaController) != 'undefined') OK
EXPECTED (video.controller == 'null') OK
EXPECTED (video.mediaGroup == '') OK

Test that the presence of a mediaGroup attribute creates a controller:
EXPECTED (video2.mediaGroup == 'group') OK
EXPECTED (video2.controller != 'null') OK

Test that setting mediaGroup to an empty string removes the controller:
RUN(video.mediaGroup = '')
EXPECTED (video.controller == 'null') OK

Test manually creating and assigning a controller to a media element:
RUN(controller = new MediaController())
RUN(video.controller = controller)
EXPECTED (video.controller == '[object MediaController]') OK

Test assigning the wrong type to the controller attribute of a media element:
TEST(video.controller = 42) THROWS("TypeError: Failed to set the 'controller' property on 'HTMLMediaElement': The provided value is not of type 'MediaController'.") OK
EXPECTED (video.controller == '[object MediaController]') OK

Test assigning a null controller to a media element:
RUN(video.controller = null)
EXPECTED (video.controller == 'null') OK

Test that two media elements with the same mediaGroup have the same controller:
RUN(video.mediaGroup = 'group')
RUN(video2.mediaGroup = 'group')
EXPECTED (video.controller === video2.controller == 'true') OK

Test that setting the controller clears the mediaGroup:
EXPECTED (video.mediaGroup == 'group') OK
RUN(video.controller = null)
EXPECTED (video.controller == 'null') OK
EXPECTED (video.hasAttribute('mediaGroup') == 'false') OK
EXPECTED (video.mediaGroup == '') OK
RUN(video.mediaGroup = 'group')
EXPECTED (video.mediaGroup == 'group') OK
RUN(video.controller = controller)
EXPECTED (video.controller == '[object MediaController]') OK
EXPECTED (video.hasAttribute('mediaGroup') == 'false') OK
EXPECTED (video.mediaGroup == '') OK

Test that setting the controller to undefined is treated as null:
EXPECTED (video.controller != 'null') OK
RUN(video.controller = undefined)
EXPECTED (video.controller == 'null') OK
END OF TEST
