This test ensures that moving the cursor in a contentEditable sends a selected text change notification, and typing in a contentEditable sends both a value changed and selected text changed notification - both on the root element that's marked as contentEditable.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
