CONSOLE WARNING: line 7: The page at 'https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-insecure-image.html' was loaded over HTTPS, but displayed insecure content from 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/security/resources/compass.jpg': this content should also be loaded over HTTPS.

This test opens a window that loads an insecure image. We should trigger a mixed content callback even though we've set the preference to block this, because we've overriden the preference via a web permission client callback.
