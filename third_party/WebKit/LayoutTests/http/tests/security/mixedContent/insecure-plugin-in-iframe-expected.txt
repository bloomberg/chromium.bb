CONSOLE WARNING: Mixed Content: The page at 'https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-insecure-plugin.html' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure plugin resource 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/mixedContent/resources/dummy.swf'. This content should also be served over HTTPS.
This test loads a secure iframe that loads an insecure plugin. We should get a mixed content callback because the insecure plug-in can script the secure origin.
