CONSOLE ERROR: line 20: Refused to apply inline style because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'none'". Either the 'unsafe-inline' keyword, a hash ('sha256-...'), or a nonce ('nonce-...') is required to enable inline execution. Note also that 'style-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.

This test ensures that style applied in isolated worlds marked with their own Content Security Policy aren't affected by the page's content security policy. Extensions, for example, should be able to inject inline CSS (even though it's probably a bad idea to do so).
