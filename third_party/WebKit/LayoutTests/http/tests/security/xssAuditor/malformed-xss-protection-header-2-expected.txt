CONSOLE ERROR: Error parsing header X-XSS-Protection: red: expected 0 or 1 at character position 0. The default protections will be applied.
CONSOLE ERROR: line 4: The XSS Auditor blocked access to 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/xssAuditor/resources/echo-intertag.pl?notifyDone=1&malformed-header=2&q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(String.fromCharCode(0x58,0x53,0x53))%3C/script%3E%3Cp%3EIf%20you%20see%20this%20message%20and%20no%20JavaScript%20alert()%20then%20the%20test%20PASSED.%3C/p%3E' because the source code of a script was found within the request. The auditor was enabled as the server did not send an 'X-XSS-Protection' header.
ALERT: URL mismatch: '[Location object access threw exception]' vs. 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/xssAuditor/resources/echo-intertag.pl?notifyDone=1&malformed-header=2&q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(String.fromCharCode(0x58,0x53,0x53))%3C/script%3E%3Cp%3EIf%20you%20see%20this%20message%20and%20no%20JavaScript%20alert()%20then%20the%20test%20PASSED.%3C/p%3E'
This tests that the X-XSS-Protection header is not ignored when the first character is not 0 or 1, and that we issue an error.
