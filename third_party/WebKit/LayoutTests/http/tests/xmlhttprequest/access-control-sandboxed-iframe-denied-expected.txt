CONSOLE ERROR: line 17: Failed to load http://127.0.0.1:8000/xmlhttprequest/resources/access-control-sandboxed-iframe-denied.cgi: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
