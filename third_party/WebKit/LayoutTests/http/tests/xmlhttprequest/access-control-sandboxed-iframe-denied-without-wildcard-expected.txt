CONSOLE WARNING: Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check https://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.
CONSOLE ERROR: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://127.0.0.1:8000/xmlhttprequest/resources/access-control-sandboxed-iframe-denied-without-wildcard.cgi. Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' that is not equal to the supplied origin. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
This test verifies that sandboxed iframe does not have XmlHttpRequest access to its server with "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" set to its own origin (127.0.0.1).

This test will print "PASS" on success.
