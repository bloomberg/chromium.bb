CONSOLE ERROR: line 16: Failed to load http://127.0.0.1:8000/xmlhttprequest/resources/access-control-sandboxed-iframe-denied-without-wildcard.cgi: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header has a value 'http://127.0.0.1:8000' that is not equal to the supplied origin. Origin 'null' is therefore not allowed access.
This test verifies that sandboxed iframe does not have XmlHttpRequest access to its server with "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" set to its own origin (127.0.0.1).

This test will print "PASS" on success.
