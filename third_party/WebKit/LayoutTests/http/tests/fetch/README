This directory contains Fetch API layout tests. As it is exposed to Window and
Worker, most (if not all) of tests are expected to run on Window,
DedicatedWorker and ServiceWorker.
For each test (say X), we have
- a script X.js in /fetch/script-tests,
- /fetch/window/X.html Window test file,
- /fetch/workers/X.html Worker test file, and
- /fetch/serviceworker/X.html ServiceWorker test file.

Some tests that require a serviceworker to test CORS requests are executed in
- /fetch/serviceworker-proxied/X.html.

Fetch-access-control tests has more files related to HTTPS tests.
See generate.py for more details.

Run
$ python generate.py
at this (/LayoutTests/http/tests/fetch/) directory to generate these files
from templates script-tests/TEMPLATE*.html.

PRESUBMIT.py checks the existence of the files.
For each file in /fetch/script-tests, the
corresponding html files must exist at the paths listed above.

Other resources such as helper JS files and server side scripts are located on
/fetch/resources.
Some tests depends on files under
/LayoutTests/http/tests/serviceworker/resources/.

Tests should conform to Service Worker Testing style[1].
