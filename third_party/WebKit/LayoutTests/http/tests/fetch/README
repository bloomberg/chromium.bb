This directory contains Fetch API layout tests. As it is exposed to Window and
Worker, most (if not all) of tests are expected to run on Window,
DedicatedWorker and ServiceWorker.
For each test (say X), we have
- a script X.js in /fetch/script-tests,
- /fetch/X.html Window test file,
- /fetch/workers/X.html Worker test file, and
- /fetch/serviceworker/X.html ServiceWorker test file.

PRESUBMIT.py checks above. For each file in /fetch/script-tests, the
corresponding html files must exist at the paths listed above.

Other resources such as helper JS files and server side scripts are located on
/fetch/resources.

Tests should conform to Service Worker Testing style[1].
