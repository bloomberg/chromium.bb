# write-temp-file.cgi - creates a file and its temporary subdirectory
#
# The file's desired basename is passed in the filename query parameter.
# The file's desired contents are passed in the data query parameter.
#
# The newly created temporary file will be inside a uniquely-named
# subdirectory to prevent crosstalk between parallel test runs.  Once
# the test is done with the temporary file its <file_path> should be
# passed to delete-temp-file.cgi for cleanup.
#
# Must be called using the HTTP POST method.
#
# On success, outputs the following three-line plaintext UTF-8
# response:
#
#   OK
#   <file_path>
#
# Where <file_path> is the full file_path of the just-written
# temporary file suitable for use with wide-character Unicode APIs
# after UTF-8 decoding and UTF-16 reencoding.
#
# Any other output is an error message and indicates failure.
#
# Errors are redirected to stdout and UTF-8 encoded to aid diagnostics
# in the calling test suite.
#
# NOTE: This CGI allows writing files with filenames including
# non-ASCII Unicode characters, but note that Blink renderer crashes
# are expected on non-Windows hosts using such filenames when a
# non-UTF-8 locale is used. Use a UTF-8 locale to prevent this,
# e.g. with:
#
# bash$ export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8
#
# Any other locale should work too provided it uses UTF-8 character
# encoding.
#
# Test failures are expected when relying on this CGI on Windows when
# using any system "ANSI" codepage ("ACP" below) other than
# windows-1252. To fix this, upgrade your system's Win32.pm Perl
# module to the latest version. Any version of Win32.pm since
# Win32-0.45 (released in 2012) should have the needed method:
# https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=78820
#
# NOTE: "ACP" in this CGI refers to the Windows concept of "ANSI"
# Codepage, a (not actually ANSI-standardized) single- or double-byte
# non-Unicode ASCII-compatible character encoding used for some
# narrow-character Win32 APIs. It should not be confused with UTF-8
# (used for similar purposes on Linux, OS X, and other modern
# POSIX-like systems), nor with the usually-distinct OEM codepage
# used for other narrow-character Win32 APIs (for instance, console
# I/O and some filesystem data storage.)
