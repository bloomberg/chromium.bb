# delete-temp-file.cgi - deletes a file and its temporary subdirectory
#
# The file's fully-qualified file path is passed in the filename query
# parameter.
#
# The file must have been previously created using
# write-temp-file.cgi, which creates files with test-chosen basenames
# inside random-named subdirectories of a system temporary directory,
# e.g. /tmp/LayoutTests_cgiXXXXX/name-chosen-by-test.txt or
# %LOCALAPPDATA%\Temp\cgiXXXXX\name-chosen-by-test.txt where XXXXX are
# random characters varying per write-temp-file.cgi run.
#
# Must be called using the HTTP POST method.
#
# Any output other than the string "OK" is an error message and
# indicates failure.
#
# Errors are redirected to stdout and UTF-8 encoded to aid diagnostics
# in the calling test suite.
#
# NOTE: "ACP" in this CGI refers to the Windows concept of "ANSI"
# Codepage, a (not actually ANSI-standardized) single- or double-byte
# non-Unicode ASCII-compatible character encoding used for some
# narrow-character Win32 APIs. It should not be confused with UTF-8
# (used for similar purposes on Linux, OS X, and other modern
# POSIX-like systems), nor with the usually-distinct OEM codepage
# used for other narrow-character Win32 APIs (for instance, console
# I/O and some filesystem data storage.)
