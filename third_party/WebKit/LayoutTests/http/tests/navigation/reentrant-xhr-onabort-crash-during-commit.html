This test creates a child iframe, which in turn creates a slow XHR then reloads.
During commit for the reload, the slow XHR is cancelled, and the XHR's onabort
handler in turn creates a new XHR, which is then aborted slightly later during
the commit process. This second XHR's onabort handler detaches the iframe. This
will cause the iframe to detach in the middle of commit, and shouldn't crash.
