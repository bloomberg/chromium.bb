# See http://www.chromium.org/developers/testing/webkit-layout-tests/testexpectations for more information on this file.

# This file should only mark tests as Slow. If they are failing in some other way, that listing should be in TestExpectations.
# Lines listed in both files will have the *union* of the expectations.

# In general, we should list tests in this file if they are slower than ~30% of the default timeout time, as we
# can see a 3x variance or more in test times on the bots. In practice, this means that any test that takes longer
# than 2 seconds in Release mode or 6 seconds in Debug mode should be listed here.
