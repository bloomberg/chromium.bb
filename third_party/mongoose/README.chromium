From the website:
Mongoose is an easy to use web server. It can be embedded into existing
application to provide a web interface to it.

Mongoose web server executable is self-sufficient, it does not depend on
anything to start serving requests. If it is copied to any directory and
executed, it starts to serve that directory on port 8080 (so to access
files, go to http://localhost:8080). If some additional config is
required - for example, different listening port or IP-based access
control, then a mongoose.conf file with respective options (see example)
can be created in the same directory where executable lives. This makes
Mongoose perfect for all sorts of demos, quick tests, file sharing, and
Web programming.

Only the necessary core server are checked in and not the test nor the
bindings to multiple languages.  The server is only used to serve custom
URLs from the JSON over HTTP webdriver protocol.  The server has been
modified to allow for 128 unique URI and not the standard 64.

Note:  There is no make file for this project, it's compiled directly in
the chrome versoin of webdriver found under the directory:
  src/chrome/test/webdriver

Local modifications:
-Do not check for OS_POSIX, instead just check that it is not windows.
