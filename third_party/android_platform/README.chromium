Description:
Android Platform engineering tools, specifically stack symbolization scripts
and a jar containing the AOSP framework to compile the Android WebView
glue layer against. The AOSP framework is built from the Android release tag
after which it is named, and the jar can be built by invoking make on the
android_system_stubs target.

Also includes a ported copy of the Android relocation packing tool source,
along with the files required to build it in the chromium tree.

Local Modifications:
Only picked the few scripts needed by chrome.
Updated output directories to use environment variable.
When calling addr2line, check the symbol is a file (and not a directory).
Added support for parsing LOG(FATAL) and DCHECK errors and their
    stack traces, as emitted by src/base/debug/stack_trace_android.cc
Added support for finding symbols when library is loaded directly from the APK.
Changed the toolchain to remove references to 4.6 toolchains.
Added support for arch=x64 as an alias to arch=x86_64

Android relocation packing tool details:
    Copy sources from AOSP bionic/tools/relocation_packer
    Remove scripts that regenerate golden test data (not relevant here)
    Create a nativehelper/ScopedFd.h to satisfy inclusion from main.cc
    Create gyp build
    Create gn build (currently packer only; no unit tests)
