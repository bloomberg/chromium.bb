Description:
Android Platform engineering tools, specifically:
1. stack symbolization scripts
2. A ported copy of the Android relocation packing tool source, along with the
   files required to build it in the chromium tree.
3. IntelliJ formatting settings.
   Taken from commit: 622d3d4c5b3bee50fd335f3282d9e9d64ae0f5f7

Local Modifications:
Only picked the few components useful to Chromium (as listed above).

The scripts have been modified to better suit Chromium development. Changes
include, but are not limited to, the following:
Added memoization of addr2line and objdump.
Added option to change the amount of symbolization done.
Updated output directories to be set by environment variable or --flags
When calling addr2line, check the symbol is a file that looks like it contains
    symbols.
Added support for parsing LOG(FATAL) and DCHECK errors and their
    stack traces, as emitted by src/base/debug/stack_trace_android.cc
Added support for finding symbols when library is loaded directly from the APK.
Changed the toolchain to remove references to 4.6 toolchains.
Added support for arch=x64 as an alias to arch=x86_64
Added debug logging and --verbose parameter.
Used fast ELF symbolizer for symbols.py and tombstones
Used multiprocessing to pre-process logcat before symbolizing it
Added code address adjustment for the debuggerd output from pre-M Android
    where relocations are packed.
Added code to capture java stderr for better handling of native->java crashes.
Fixed invalid using decl in logging header debug.h
Only attempt to symbolize with ELF libraries.

Changed the stack script to use llvm symbolizer instead of addr2line,
objdump, etc, since llvm symbolizer is more efficient in finding
function names, line numbers etc.

Speedup symbolization by avoiding unnecessary APK manifest extraction loops.

Android relocation packing tool details:
    Copy sources from AOSP bionic/tools/relocation_packer
    Remove scripts that regenerate golden test data (not relevant here)
    Create a nativehelper/ScopedFd.h to satisfy inclusion from main.cc
    Create gyp build
    Create gn build (currently packer only; no unit tests)
