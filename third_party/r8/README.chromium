Local Modifications:
Turning off vertical and horizontal class merging, as described in
https://issuetracker.google.com/122902374#comment11. We should no longer make
this modification once the linked bug is fixed.

Turning off outlining because it caused issues when synchronized proguarding
Trichrome due to illegal dex references (crbug.com/956839). Will only be used
for android_apk() targets that set `disable_r8_outlining = true`):
