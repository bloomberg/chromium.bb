Security Critical: no

Description:
This directory contains selected tools from the Debian's devscripts collection.

An .orig file is checked in so that our patched version can be easily
compared with the unpatched script (e.g. when sending the changes upstream).
Having a .patch file checked in was too inconvenient to keep up to date.
