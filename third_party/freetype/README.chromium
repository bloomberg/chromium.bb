Description:
This package tracks upstream FreeType, but the build files and configuration
are based on the Android source tree. This package is only used for Android
and Chromecast. For other platforms the system FreeType library is used.

How to update:
1. Find the desired commit in
   https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/third_party/freetype2/ .
   If such a commit does not yet exist, branch from the appropriate point with
   a branch name like "chromium/android/VER-X-X-X-updates" depending on the
   FreeType tag being branched and commit changes there.
2. Update BUILD.gn to reflect any changes. This build should be kept
   in sync with the Android.mk for FreeType in Android as possible.
3. Merge the new src/include/freetype/config/ftoption.h into
   include/freetype-android-config/ftoption.h .
4. Update this file.
5. Commit build changes while rolling Chromium's freetype-android DEPS to the
   new commit.
