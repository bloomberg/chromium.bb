This directory is a placeholder for Fuchsia tools that will be downloaded by
CIPD (https://github.com/luci/luci-go/tree/master/cipd). The toolchain.ensure
files specifies which CIPD packages to retrieve, at which versions, and where
they're stored locally. The CIPD update happens as part of gclient runhooks.
