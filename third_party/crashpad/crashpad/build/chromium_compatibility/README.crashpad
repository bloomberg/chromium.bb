This directory is used as a secondary GN source root for compatibility with
Chromium. Files in this subtree should match file paths that the Crashpad build
files need to refer to when building in Chromium. In the Crashpad tree, they
should either be empty/no-ops, or forward to the real Crashpad implementation
in the real tree. No actual configuration should be done in this secondary tree.
