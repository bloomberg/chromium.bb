Description:
This directory contains the source code of Abseil for C++. This can be used by
Chromium's dependencies, but shouldn't be used by Chromium itself.
See: https://goo.gl/TgnJb8.

How to update Abseil:

1. Download the code from the Abseil git repository (see URL).

2. Copy the content of the Abseil git repo to //third_party/abseil-cpp.

3. From //third_party/abseil-cpp/ launch ./rename_annotations.sh.
   This script will rewrite dynamic_annotations and thread_annotations
   macros and function inside Abseil in order to avoid ODR violations
   and macro clashing with Chromium
   (see: https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/issues/122).

Local Modifications:

* absl/copts.bzl has been translated to //third_party/absl-cpp/BUILD.gn. Both
  files contain lists of compiler flags in order to reduce duplication.

* All the BUILD.bazel files has been translated to BUILD.gn files.

* Functions and macros in absl/base/dynamic_annotations.{h,cc} and
  absl/base/thread_annotations.h have been renamed to avoid ODR
  violations and macro clashes with Chromium (see step 3).
