Description:
This directory contains the source code of Abseil for C++. This can be used by
Chromium's dependencies, but shouldn't be used by Chromium itself.
See: https://goo.gl/TgnJb8.

How to update Abseil:

1. Download the code from the Abseil git repository (see URL).

2. Copy the content of the Abseil git repo to //third_party/abseil-cpp.

4. Generate BUILD.gn files launching bazel_to_gn.py from //third_party/abseil-cpp.

5. Rename RunningOnValgrind to AbslRunningOnValgrind:
   find . -type f -exec sed -i "s/RunningOnValgrind/AbslRunningOnValgrind/g" {} \;

6. Rename ValgrindSlowdown to AbslValgrindSlowdown:
   find . -type f -exec sed -i "s/ValgrindSlowdown/AbslValgrindSlowdown/g" {} \;

Local Modifications:

* absl/copts.bzl has been translated to //third_party/absl-cpp/BUILD.gn. Both files
  contain lists of compiler flags in order to reduce duplication.

* All the BUILD.bazel files has been translated to BUILD.gn files.

* RunningOnValgrind and ValgrindSlowdown have been renamed to avoid ODR violations.
