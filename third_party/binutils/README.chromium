Description:
This directory contains i386 and amd64 binaries of the binutils tools
(including gold linker).

They were built from binutils-2.28 using the "build-all.sh" script on a
Ubuntu Trusty.

The script creates chroots for 32bit and 64bit Ubuntu Precise and then builds
binutils inside the roots.

Version 2.28 was released on Thu, 02 Mar 2017

Local patches:

 * (build-all.sh|build-one.sh|upload.sh) scripts for building the binutils
   binaries and uploading them to Google storage.

 * Update build-all.sh with the new binutil version.
