Description:
This directory contains i386 and amd64 binaries of the binutils tools
(including gold linker).

They were built from binutils-2.26 using the "build-all.sh" script on a
Ubuntu Trusty.

The script creates chroots for 32bit and 64bit Ubuntu Precise and then builds
binutils inside the roots.

Version 2.26 was released on Mon, 25 Jan 2016
