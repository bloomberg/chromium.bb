The `x-style` extension of the native `<style>` element allows defining styles
in the main document that can take advantage of several special features of
Polymer's styling system:

* Document styles defined in an `x-style` will be shimmed to ensure they do
not leak into local DOM when running on browsers without non-native Shadow DOM.
* Shadow DOM-specific `/deep/` and `::shadow` combinators will be shimmed on
browsers without non-native Shadow DOM.
* Custom properties used by Polymer's experimental shim for cross-scope styling
may be defined in an `x-style`.

Example:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <script src="components/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-lite.js"></script>
  <link rel="import" href="components/polymer/polymer.html">

  <style is="x-style">
    
    /* Will be prevented from affecting local DOM of Polymer elements */
    * {
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    
    /* Can use /deep/ and ::shadow combinators */
    body /deep/ .my-special-view::shadow #thing-inside {
      background: yellow;
    }
    
    /* Custom properties that inherit down the document tree may be defined */
    body {
      --my-toolbar-title-color: green;
    }
    
  </style>

</head>
<body>

    ...

</body>
</html>
```

Note, all features of `x-style` are available when defining styles as part of Polymer elements (e.g. `<style>` elements within `<dom-module>`'s used for defining Polymer elements. The `x-style` extension should only be used for defining document styles, outside of a custom element's local DOM.
