`<iron-input>` is a wrapper to a native `<input>` element, that adds two-way binding
and prevention of invalid input. To use it, you must distribute a native `<input>`
yourself. You can continue to use the native `input` as you would normally:

    <iron-input>
      <input>
    </iron-input>

    <iron-input>
      <input type="email" disabled>
    </iron-input>

### Two-way binding

By default you can only get notified of changes to a native `<input>`'s `value`
due to user input:

    <input value="{{myValue::input}}">

This means that if you imperatively set the value (i.e. `someNativeInput.value = 'foo'`),
no events will be fired and this change cannot be observed.

`iron-input` adds the `bind-value` property that mirrors the native `input`'s '`value` property; this
property can be used for two-way data binding.
`bind-value` will notify if it is changed either by user input or by script.

    <iron-input bind-value="{{myValue}}">
      <input>
    </iron-input>

Note: this means that if you want to imperatively set the native `input`'s, you _must_
set `bind-value` instead, so that the wrapper `iron-input` can be notified.

### Validation

`iron-input` uses the native `input`'s validation. For simplicity, `iron-input`
has a `validate()` method (which internally just checks the distributed `input`'s
validity), which sets an `invalid` attribute that can also be used for styling.

To validate automatically as you type, you can use the `auto-validate` attribute.

`iron-input` also fires an `iron-input-validate` event after `validate()` is
called. You can use it to implement a custom validator:

    var CatsOnlyValidator = {
      validate: function(ironInput) {
        var valid = !ironInput.bindValue || ironInput.bindValue === 'cat';
        ironInput.invalid = !valid;
        return valid;
      }
    }
    ironInput.addEventListener('iron-input-validate', function() {
      CatsOnly.validate(input2);
    });

You can also use an element implementing an [`IronValidatorBehavior`](/element/PolymerElements/iron-validatable-behavior).
This example can also be found in the demo for this element:

    <iron-input validator="cats-only">
      <input>
    </iron-input>

### Preventing invalid input

It may be desirable to only allow users to enter certain characters. You can use the
`allowed-pattern` attribute to accomplish this. This feature
is separate from validation, and `allowed-pattern` does not affect how the input is validated.

    // Only allow typing digits, but a valid input has exactly 5 digits.
    <iron-input allowed-pattern="[0-9]">
      <input pattern="\d{5}">
    </iron-input>
