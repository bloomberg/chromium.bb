<!--
`<ripple-animation>` scales and transform an element such that it appears to ripple from either
a shared element, or from a screen position, to full screen.

If using as a shared element animation in `<neon-animated-pages>`, use this animation in an `exit`
animation in the source page and in an `entry` animation in the destination page. Also, define the
hero elements in the `sharedElements` property (not a configuration property, see
`Polymer.NeonSharedElementAnimatableBehavior`).

If using a screen position, define the `gesture` property.

Configuration:
```
{
  name: 'ripple-animation`.
  id: <shared-element-id>, /* set this or gesture */
  gesture: {x: <page-x>, y: <page-y>}, /* set this or id */
  timing: <animation-timing>,
  toPage: <node>, /* define for the destination page */
  fromPage: <node>, /* define for the source page */
}
```
