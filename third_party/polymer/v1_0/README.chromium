Description:
This directory contains a copy of the following components which are a part of
the Polymer project:
-polymer core + externs
-Iron elements and their dependencies
-Paper elements and their dependencies
See bower.json for a full list of components.

The version can be found in header of polymer/polymer.js. The license can
be found in polymer/LICENSE.

The source git repositories can be found at:
Core Library - https://github.com/Polymer/polymer
Elements - https://github.com/PolymerElements/<element name>

Polymer is comprised of two efforts:
1. A set of core platform features (Shadow DOM, Custom Elements, MDV).
Initially, these core features will be enabled with a set of polyfills. As
browsers begin to implement these new primitives, the polyfill platform layer
becomes smaller and better over time.
2. A next-generation web application framework built upon these core
technologies called the Polymer.

Local Modifications:
- Removed executable bit from the files in 'components/iron-selector'.
- Created a copy 'components-chromium' of the 'components' directory with the
only difference that all inline JavaScript blocks are extracted from Polymer
HTML elements to external JS files. This version of the Polymer is used in a web
UI, where CSP forbids an execution of inline scripts. The extraction was made
using Crisper (https://github.com/PolymerLabs/crisper).
- Replaced CRLF line endings with LF line endings in text files.
- Apply chromium.patch with local modifications. The patch is applied to
components-chromium (i.e. after extracting the inline scripts) so that the
results of 'git diff' (after any new local changes are applied) can be appended
to chromium.patch.

To restore the contents of the 'components' and 'components-chromium'
directories from scratch, run ./reproduce.sh (requires bower and crisper).

Note on Bower:
The directory can be updated by running "bower update". A new component can be
installed by running "bower install -S Polymer/<component>#version". Be sure to
add the .bower.json file to the repository as it includes the revision
information of the polymer component.
Also be sure that you listed all the added packages and **all their
dependencies** in bower.json, and specified **exact** versions of every package
explicitly. That is needed because Bower can't handle recursive dependencies
correctly (see http://stackoverflow.com/q/25899532).
