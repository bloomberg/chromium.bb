The `core-overlay` element displays overlayed on top of other content. It starts
out hidden and is displayed by setting its `opened` property to true.
A `core-overlay's` opened state can be toggled by calling the `toggle`
method.

The `core-overlay` will, by default, show/hide itself when it's opened. The 
`target` property may be set to another element to cause that element to 
be shown when the overlay is opened.

It's common to want a `core-overlay` to animate to its opened
position. The `core-overlay` element uses a `core-transition` to handle
animation. The default transition is `core-transition-fade` which 
causes the overlay to fade in when displayed. See 
<a href="../core-transition/">`core-transition`</a> for more
information about customizing a `core-overlay's` opening animation. The
`backdrop` property can be set to true to show a backdrop behind the overlay
that will darken the rest of the window.

An element that should close the `core-overlay` will automatically
do so if it's given the `core-overlay-toggle` attribute. This attribute
can be customized with the `closeAttribute` property. You can also use
`closeSelector` if more general matching is needed.

By default  `core-overlay` will close whenever the user taps outside it or
presses the escape key. This behavior can be turned off via the
`autoCloseDisabled` property.

    <core-overlay>
      <h2>Dialog</h2>
      <input placeholder="say something..." autofocus>
      <div>I agree with this wholeheartedly.</div>
      <button core-overlay-toggle>OK</button>
    </core-overlay>

`core-overlay` will automatically size and position itself according to the 
following rules. If the target's style.top and style.left are unset, the 
target will be centered. The size of the target is constrained to be no larger
than the window dimensions. The `margin` property specifies the extra amount
of space that should be reserved around the overlay. This can be used to ensure
that, for example, a drop shadow is always visible around the overlay.
