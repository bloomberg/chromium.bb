Description:
Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG) is an interface compiler
that connects programs written in C and C++ with scripting languages such as
Perl, Python, Ruby, and Tcl. It works by taking the declarations found in
C/C++ header files and using them to generate the wrapper code that scripting
languages need to access the underlying C/C++ code.

Local Modifications:
Removed all non-python bindings from Lib/.
