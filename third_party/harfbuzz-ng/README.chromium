Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

This copy of harfbuzz is usually updated by downloading the release tarball from
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/ , removing files in src,
copying *.h *.hh *.cc (except for the files below) from the tarball's src folder
over to src, then checking for removed or added files and update our build
recipes in BUILD.gn and harfbuzz.gyp accordingly, update the NEWS file from
HarfBuzz' release notes, and bump the version numbers in README.chromium.

Currently the following files from HarfBuzz are unused and not copied:
