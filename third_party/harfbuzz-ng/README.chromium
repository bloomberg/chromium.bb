Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

This copy of harfbuzz is usually updated by downloading the release tarball
from http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/ , removing
files in src, copying *.h *.hh *.cc (except for hb-uniscribe* and
hb-directwrite.*) from the tarball's src folder over to src, then checking for
removed or added files and update our build recipes in BUILD.gn and
harfbuzz.gyp accordingly, update the NEWS file from HarfBuzz' release notes,
and bump the version numbers in README.chromium.

Locally cherry picked blacklisting for GDEF tables of Padauk 2.5 from
https://github.com/behdad/harfbuzz/pull/419/files for https://crbug.com/681813.
