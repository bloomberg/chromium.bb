Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

This copy of harfbuzz is usually updated by downloading the release tarball from
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/ , removing files in src,
copying *.h *.hh *.cc (except for hb-uniscribe* and hb-directwrite.* and
hb-fallback-shape.cc) from the tarball's src folder over to src, then checking
for removed or added files and update our build recipes in BUILD.gn and
harfbuzz.gyp accordingly, update the NEWS file from HarfBuzz' release notes, and
bump the version numbers in README.chromium.

Locally patch hb-private.hh to silence unusued variable warnings in MSVC.

Locally patching hb_set implementation back to the pre 1.6.1 implemention as we
observe a set of timeToFirst*Paint performance regressions in issue 781794.
