Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

This copy of harfbuzz is usually updated by downloading the release tarball
from http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/ , removing
files in src, copying *.h *.hh *.cc from the tarball's src folder over to src,
then checking for removed or added files and update our build recipes in
BUILD.gn and harfbuzz.gyp accordingly.

Right now, it uses revision d457e3f0ff9b27616a34e4cc110d3edbf8796841 from
https://github.com/behdad/harfbuzz
