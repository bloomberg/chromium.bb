Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

This copy of harfbuzz is updated by putting the new commit hash matching one in
https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/ to the
top level DEPS file. When upgrading, check in ther HarfBuzz repository whether
files have been added or removed in upstream and whether the BUILD.gn file needs
to be updated to reflect that or whether the files can be added to the exception
lis below.

Example:
    $ cd ~/dev/harfbuzz/
    $ git diff --diff-filter=A --stat 1.8.3..1.8.7

Replace 1.8.3 and 1.8.7 with the respective revision hashes for your roll CL.

Chromium-local cherry picks or patches can be done by pushing new branches to
refs/heads/chromium/ of [1]. The set of HarfBuzz OWNERS has write rights to this
part of the tree. We suggest to follow a pattern of naming branches needed for
Chromium revisions by the chromium milestone number. For example, if a
cherry-pick is needed for M65, push to "refs/heads/chromium/m65" and reference
the new commit in DEPS. Take a look at
https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/937502 for an example.

Currently we are intentionally not building the following files from
HarfBuzz. Specifically, we are not building hb-coretext any longer, as we rely
on HarfBuzz' built-in AAT shaping.
