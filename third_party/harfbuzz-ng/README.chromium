Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

This copy of harfbuzz is usually updated by downloading the release tarball from
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/ , removing files in src,
copying *.h *.hh *.cc (except for hb-uniscribe* and hb-directwrite.* and
hb-fallback-shape.cc) from the tarball's src folder over to src, then checking
for removed or added files and update our build recipes in BUILD.gn and
harfbuzz.gyp accordingly, update the NEWS file from HarfBuzz' release notes, and
bump the version numbers in README.chromium.

Locally added #undef PAGE_SIZE to hb-set-private.hh to avoid a collision with
#usr/include/asm/page.h as part of the Android NDK.

Temporarily patched to original CoreText default font size 36.f that was used
before to ease Blink reabaselining.
