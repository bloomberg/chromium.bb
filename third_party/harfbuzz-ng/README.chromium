Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

This copy of harfbuzz is updated by putting the new commit hash matching one in
https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/ to the
top level DEPS file. When upgrading, check whether files have been added or
removed in upstream and whether the BUILD.gn file needs to be updated to reflect
that.

Chromium-local cherry picks or patches can be done by pushing new branches to
refs/heads/chromium/ of [1]. The set of HarfBuzz OWNERS has write rights to this
part of the tree. We suggest to follow a pattern of naming branches needed for
Chromium revisions by the chromium milestone number. For example, if a
cherry-pick is needed for M65, push to "refs/heads/chromium/m65" and reference
the new commit in DEPS. Take a look at
https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/937502 for an example.

Currently we are intentionally not building the following files from HarfBuzz.
