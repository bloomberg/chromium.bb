Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

This copy of harfbuzz is usually updated by downloading the release tarball from
http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/ , removing files in src,
copying *.h *.hh *.cc (except for hb-uniscribe* and hb-directwrite.* and
hb-fallback-shape.cc) from the tarball's src folder over to src, then checking
for removed or added files and update our build recipes in BUILD.gn and
harfbuzz.gyp accordingly, update the NEWS file from HarfBuzz' release notes, and
bump the version numbers in README.chromium.

Currently the following files from HarfBuzz are unused and not copied:
	dump-indic-data.cc
	dump-khmer-data.cc
	dump-myanmar-data.cc
	dump-use-data.cc
	hb-aat-layout-common-private.hh
	hb-aat-layout-kerx-table.hh
	hb-aat-layout-morx-table.hh
	hb-aat-layout-private.hh
	hb-aat-layout.cc
	hb-directwrite.cc
	hb-directwrite.h
	hb-fallback-shape.cc
	hb-subset-glyf.cc
	hb-subset-glyf.hh
	hb-subset-input.cc
	hb-subset-plan.cc
	hb-subset-private.hh
	hb-subset.cc
	hb-uniscribe.cc
	hb-uniscribe.h

Cherry-pick 0c66043a..0bff6991 to test hb_set optimizations and page size
change.

Patch hb-ot-shape.cc to not include any aat headers yet.
