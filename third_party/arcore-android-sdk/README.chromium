Description:
The ARCore Android SDK provides augmented reality capabilities to Android
devices.

Local Modifications:
To address binary size concerns, we are using a minimal shim produced for
Chromium that is not publicly distributed elsewhere. We have also stripped the
.so's to minimize their size.

Also, added BUILD.gn for compilation in chrome.

IMPORTANT: make sure to change chrome/android/java/AndroidManifest.xml
com.google.ar.core.min_apk_version attribute if a newer version of the
ARCore APK is required to maintain compatibility with this SDK.
