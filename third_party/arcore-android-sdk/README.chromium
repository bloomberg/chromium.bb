Changes:
2019-07-22 - Upgrade test-apks/arcore_current.apk to v1.10.
2019-04-02 - Upgrade test-apks/arcore_current.apk to v1.8.
2018-12-11 - Upgrade ARCore to v1.5. Remove checked in .so files - we now
             extract them from ARCore's .aar file at build time.
2018-12-11 - Upgrade test-apks/arcore_current.apk to v1.6.
2018-09-14 - Upgrade test-apks/arcore_current.apk to v1.4.
2018-08-10 - First, removed arcore shim copy target from BUILD.gn since it is no
             longer needed. Second, added zero-byte dummy arcore library for AR
             module support.
2018-07-26 - Added test-apks/ subdirectory for storing production versions of AR
             APKs for testing.
2018-07-19 - Updated BUILD.gn to support secondary abi (the previous change for
             arm64 support turned out to be insufficient) and removed the unused
             libarcore_sdk target.
2018-05-04 - Updated BUILD.gn to work properly for arm64.
