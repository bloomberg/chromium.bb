Description:
A fork of the WebXR samples to be kept in sync with Chrome and used for testing Chrome.

Local Modifications:
Forked to provide a stable set of test pages in sync with Chrome.
Stripped out the media/ directory to minimize the size.

Instructions:
In order to serve the samples locally, few steps are required:
1. Copy contents of src/chrome/test/data/xr/webxr_samples/media into src/third_party/webxr_test_pages/webxr-samples/media
2. (optional) If editing cottontail code, run `npm install` and `npm run build-all` in src/third_party/webxr_test_pages/webxr-samples/js/cottontail
3. Serve files, for example by running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port number>` in src/third_party/webxr_test_pages/webxr-samples
