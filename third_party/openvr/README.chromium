Description:
The OpenVR API supports HTC Vive and other headsets for VR.

Local Modifications:
Only contains a subset of the git repo necessary to build Chromium.
jsoncpp.cpp has been modified to replace two "throw" statements with invocations
of JSON_FAIL_MESSAGE because "cannot use 'throw' with exceptions disabled".
openvr.h has been modified to remove dllimport/dllexport when building a
non-component build so this can be built as a static library.
