Description:
  WebDriver is a clean, fast framework for automated testing of webapps.

Contents:
  pylib/
    Python bindings and tests for WebDriver pulled in via DEPS.

  atoms.h, atoms.cc
    These atoms are generated by the webdriver team and are to be checked in
    manually. The current version was generated from revision
    ec9202eceb8b8e334ceee76e4670154c1aaf89a6.

    Generating the atoms require a build tool named Bazel. Download it
    from https://bazel.build/.

    To generate the atoms using the code found in selenium tree:
      $ git clone https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium.git
      $ cd selenium
      $ git apply <chromium_dir>/src/third_party/webdriver/patch.diff
      $ bazel build javascript/chrome-driver/...
      $ cp bazel-bin/javascript/chrome-driver/atoms.h \
           <chromium_dir>/src/third_party/webdriver/atoms.h
      $ cp bazel-bin/javascript/chrome-driver/atoms.cc \
           <chromium_dir>/src/third_party/webdriver/atoms.cc

    The atoms.h/cc files are only used directly in the chrome version of
    webdriver found under the path src/chrome/test/chromedriver.

    bazel-bin is a symlink. To find files within the selenium folder, add -L
    $ find -L . -name atoms.h

    If the patch.diff fails to apply, rerun with --reject. Review the output and
    manually merge the failed changes. Regenerate the patch when finished:
    $ git diff > <chromium_dir>/src/third_party/webdriver/patch.diff

Local Modifications:
- Applied changes in patch.diff to the selenium tree prior to building the atoms.
