Patches:

      * Disallow adding symbol visibility attribute automatically to
        function for static linked library.
    0002-Do-not-redefine-lean-and-mean.patch:
      * Do not redefine WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN which breaks the Windows

      * Include stdlib.h for declaration of malloc, free.
    0004-Remove-truncating-cast-of-constant.patch:
