Description:
This contains a copy of Android Oreo's AsyncTask.java.

Local Modifications:
- Renamed package to org.chromium.base.
- Explicitly import android.os objects.
- Switch to using android.support.annotations (from android.support.v13).
- Added annotations to help it compile issue-free.
- Changed THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR to use our extension of Android's
  ThreadPoolExecutor (which adds information about the work queue when it fills
  up)
- Added function which shuts down Android's ThreadPoolExecutor, and rerouted
  runnables sent to Android's ThreadPoolExecutor to our Executor.
- Changed SERIAL_EXECUTOR to reuse the executor from android.os.AsyncTask
