# Generic Sensor

`third_party/WebKit/Source/modules/sensor` implements the following concrete
sensor intrefaces based on the [Generic Sensor API]
(https://w3c.github.io/sensors):
1. [Ambient Light Sensor] (https://w3c.github.io/ambient-light)
1. [Accelerometer] (https://w3c.github.io/accelerometer)
1. [Gyroscope] (https://w3c.github.io/gyroscope)
1. [Magnetometer] (https://w3c.github.io/magnetometer)
1. [Absolute Orientation Sensor] (https://w3c.github.io/orientation-sensor)

The platform-specific parts of the implementation are located in
`device/generic_sensor`.
