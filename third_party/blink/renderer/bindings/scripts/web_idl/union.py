    Union class makes a group of union types with the same flattened member
    types and the same result whether it includes a nullable type or not.

    For example, the following union types will be grouped into one Union
    instance.
      (A? or B or C), (A or B? or C), ((A or B) or C?), (A or (B or C?)), ...
    All these unions have the same set of flattened member types (A, B, C) and
    include a nullable type.

    However, all following union types will be grouped into separate Union
    instances.
      (A or B), ([X] A or B), ([Y] A or B)
    IdlType(A), IdlType([X] A), and IdlType([Y] A) are all distinguished from
    each other as they behave differently.  Bindings code generators are
    expected to define an implementation class for each Union instance.
