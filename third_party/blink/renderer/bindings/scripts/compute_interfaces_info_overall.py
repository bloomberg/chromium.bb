"""Compute global interface information, including public information, dependencies, and inheritance.

Computed data is stored in a global variable, |interfaces_info|, and written as
output (concretely, exported as a pickle). This is then used by the IDL compiler
itself, so it does not need to compute global information itself, and so that
inter-IDL dependencies are clear, since they are all computed here.

The |interfaces_info| pickle is a *global* dependency: any changes cause a full
rebuild. This is to avoid having to compute which public data is visible by
which IDL files on a file-by-file basis, which is very complex for little
benefit.
|interfaces_info| should thus only contain data about an interface that
contains paths or is needed by *other* interfaces, e.g., path data (to abstract
the compiler from OS-specific file paths) or public data (to avoid having to
read other interfaces unnecessarily).
It should *not* contain full information about an interface (e.g., all
extended attributes), as this would cause unnecessary rebuilds.

|interfaces_info| is a dict, keyed by |interface_name|.

Current keys are:
* dependencies:
    'including_mixins': targets of 'includes' statements
    'referenced_interfaces': reference interfaces that are introspected
                             (currently just targets of [PutForwards])

* inheritance:
    'ancestors': all ancestor interfaces
    'inherited_extended_attributes': inherited extended attributes
                                     (all controlling memory management)

* public:
    'is_callback_interface': bool, callback interface or not
    'implemented_as': value of [ImplementedAs=...] on interface (C++ class name)

* paths:
    'full_path': path to the IDL file, so can lookup an IDL by interface name
    'include_path': path for use in C++ #include directives
    'dependencies_full_paths': paths to dependencies (for merging into main)
    'dependencies_include_paths': paths for use in C++ #include directives
    'dependencies_other_component_full_paths':
        paths to dependencies (cannot merge because of other component)
    'dependencies_other_component_include_paths':
        paths for use in C++ #include directives because of dependencies in
        other component

Note that all of these are stable information, unlikely to change without
moving or deleting files (hence requiring a full rebuild anyway) or significant
code changes (for inherited extended attributes).
