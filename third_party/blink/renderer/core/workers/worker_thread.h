  // called on the worker global scope, queued tasks must be discarded soon
  // before worker shutdown is formally requested via the parent thread. The

  // To achieve this, the worker thread runs PrepareForShutdownOnWorkerThread()
  // immediately after the task that called close() (see DidProcessTask()), and
