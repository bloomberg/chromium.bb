// ResourceLoadObserver is a collection of functions which meet following
// conditions.
// 1. It's not possible to implement it in platform/loader.
// 2. It's about individual loading operation. For example, a function
//    notifying that all requests are gone would not belong to this class.
// 3. It is called when the loader gets some input, typically from the network
//    subsystem. There may be some cases where the source of the input is not
//    from network - For example, this class may have a function which is called
//    when ResourceFetcher::RequestResource is called. On the other hand, this
//    class will not have "operation"s, such as PrepareRequest.
