  // found by the most recent Find operation, or will be empty if |version| is
  // not greater than the |current_version| in the FindMatchRects call (hence
  // your locally cached rects should still be valid). The rect coords will be
  // custom normalized fractions of the document size. The rects will be sorted
  // by frame traversal order starting in the main frame, then by DOM order.
  //
  // |active_rect| will contain the bounding box of the active find-in-page
  // match marker, in similarly normalized coords (or an empty rect if there
