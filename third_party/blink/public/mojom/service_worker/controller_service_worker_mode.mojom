// BEWARE: In non-NetS13nServiceWorker, the renderer often does not know which
// controller service worker a request will go to, as skipWaiting() may occur
// in the browser process at the same time the renderer makes a request.
// Therefore, non-NetS13nServiceWorker should usually treat
// kNoFetchEventHandler and kControlled as the same.
