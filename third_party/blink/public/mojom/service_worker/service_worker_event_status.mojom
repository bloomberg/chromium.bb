  // The event dispatch completed successfully.
  COMPLETED,

  // Only for extendable events. A promise passed to waitUntil() or
  // respondWith() was rejected. It may also mean dispatch failed, but the
  // meaning of that depends on the event type. It could possibly mean
  // JavaScript execution was forcibly terminated or an uncaught runtime
  // script error occurred while dispatching. For FetchEvent, it looks
  // like we set REJECTED when the service worker did not provide a
  // response but defaultPrevented() was called, preventing falling back
  // to network.
  REJECTED,

  // ABORTED happens in at least two cases:
  // - The service worker execution context was destroyed while the event was
  // alive.
  // - The event timed out.
  //
  // TODO(falken): It seems useful to add a TIMEOUT status.
