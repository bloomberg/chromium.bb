This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Finishing an animation with a zero playback rate throws
PASS Finishing an infinite animation throws
PASS Finishing an animation seeks to the end time
PASS Finishing an animation with a current time past the effect end jumps back to the end
PASS Finishing a reversed animation jumps to zero time
PASS Finishing a reversed animation with a current time less than zero makes it jump back to zero
PASS Finishing a paused animation resolves the start time
FAIL Finishing a pause-pending animation resolves the pending task immediately and update the start time assert_false: expected false got undefined
FAIL Finishing a pause-pending animation with negative playback rate resolves the pending task immediately assert_false: expected false got undefined
FAIL Finishing an animation while play-pending resolves the pending task immediately assert_false: expected false got undefined
PASS Finishing an animation during an aborted pause makes it finished immediately
PASS Finishing an animation resolves the finished promise synchronously
PASS Finishing an animation without a target resolves the finished promise synchronously
PASS A pending ready promise is resolved and not replaced when the animation is finished
FAIL A pending playback rate should be applied immediately when an animation is finished promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: animation.updatePlaybackRate is not a function"
FAIL An exception should be thrown if the effective playback rate is zero promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: animation.updatePlaybackRate is not a function"
FAIL An exception should be thrown when finishing if the effective playback rate is positive and the target effect end is infinity promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: animation.updatePlaybackRate is not a function"
FAIL An exception is NOT thrown when finishing if the effective playback rate is negative and the target effect end is infinity promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: animation.updatePlaybackRate is not a function"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
