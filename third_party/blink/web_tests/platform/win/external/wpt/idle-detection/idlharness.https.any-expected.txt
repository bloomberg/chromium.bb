This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Test IDL implementation of Idle Detection API
PASS IdleDetector interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS IdleDetector interface object length
PASS IdleDetector interface object name
PASS IdleDetector interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS IdleDetector interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS IdleDetector interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS IdleDetector interface: attribute state
PASS IdleDetector interface: attribute onchange
PASS IdleDetector interface: operation start()
PASS IdleDetector interface: operation stop()
PASS IdleDetector must be primary interface of idle
PASS Stringification of idle
PASS IdleDetector interface: idle must inherit property "state" with the proper type
PASS IdleDetector interface: idle must inherit property "onchange" with the proper type
PASS IdleDetector interface: idle must inherit property "start()" with the proper type
PASS IdleDetector interface: idle must inherit property "stop()" with the proper type
PASS IdleState interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS IdleState interface object length
PASS IdleState interface object name
PASS IdleState interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS IdleState interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS IdleState interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS IdleState interface: attribute user
PASS IdleState interface: attribute screen
PASS IdleState must be primary interface of idle.state
PASS Stringification of idle.state
PASS IdleState interface: idle.state must inherit property "user" with the proper type
PASS IdleState interface: idle.state must inherit property "screen" with the proper type
Harness: the test ran to completion.
