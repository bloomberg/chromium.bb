This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Pausing clears the start time
PASS Aborting a pause preserves the start time
PASS A pending ready promise should be resolved and not replaced when the animation is paused
FAIL A pause-pending animation maintains the current time when applying a pending playback rate assert_greater_than: expected a number greater than 50000 but got 50000
PASS The animation's current time remains fixed after pausing
Harness: the test ran to completion.
