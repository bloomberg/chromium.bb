This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Initial iceConnectionState should be new
PASS Closing the connection should set iceConnectionState to closed
PASS connection with one data channel should eventually have connected or completed connection state
PASS connection with one data channel should eventually have connected connection state
PASS connection with audio track should eventually have connected connection state
PASS connection with audio and video tracks should eventually have connected connection state
PASS ICE can connect in a recvonly usecase
PASS iceConnectionState changes at the right time, with bundle policy balanced
FAIL iceConnectionState changes at the right time, with bundle policy max-bundle assert_equals: ICE transport.state expected "connected" but got "new"
FAIL iceConnectionState changes at the right time, with bundle policy max-compat assert_equals: ICE transport.state expected "connected" but got "new"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
