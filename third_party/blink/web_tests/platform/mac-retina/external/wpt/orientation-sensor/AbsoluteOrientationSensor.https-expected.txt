This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: Test that onerror is sent when sensor is not supported.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: Test that onerror is sent when permissions are not granted.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: Test that onerror is send when start() call has failed.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: Test that frequency is capped to allowed maximum.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: Test that frequency is capped to the maximum supported frequency.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: Test that frequency is limited to the minimum supported frequency.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: Test that sensor cannot be constructed within iframe disallowed to use feature policy.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: Test that sensor can be constructed within an iframe allowed to use feature policy.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: Test that 'onreading' is called and sensor reading is valid.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: sensor reading is correct.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: sensor timestamp is updated when time passes.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: Test that sensor can be successfully created and its states are correct.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: sensor.start() returns undefined.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: no exception is thrown when calling start() on already started sensor.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: sensor.stop() returns undefined.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: no exception is thrown when calling stop() on already stopped sensor.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: Test that fresh reading is fetched on start().
FAIL AbsoluteOrientationSensor: frequency hint works. assert_greater_than: Fast sensor overtakes the slow one expected a number greater than 2 but got 1
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: sensor receives suspend / resume notifications when cross-origin subframe is focused.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: throw 'TypeError' if frequency is invalid.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: sensor reading is correct when options.referenceFrame is 'screen'.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor: throw 'TypeError' if referenceFrame is not one of enumeration values.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor.quaternion return a four-element FrozenArray.
PASS AbsoluteOrientationSensor.populateMatrix() method works correctly.
Harness: the test ran to completion.
