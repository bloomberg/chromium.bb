This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Test driver
PASS Partial interface Navigator: original interface defined
PASS Navigator interface: attribute clipboard
PASS Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "clipboard" with the proper type

PASS ClipboardEvent interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS ClipboardEvent interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS ClipboardEvent interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS ClipboardEvent interface: attribute clipboardData
PASS ClipboardEvent must be primary interface of new ClipboardEvent("x")
PASS Stringification of new ClipboardEvent("x")
PASS ClipboardEvent interface: new ClipboardEvent("x") must inherit property "clipboardData" with the proper type
PASS Clipboard interface: existence and properties of interface object
