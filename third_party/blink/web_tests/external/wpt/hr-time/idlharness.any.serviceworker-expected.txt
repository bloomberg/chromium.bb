This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS idl_test setup
PASS Partial interface mixin WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope: original interface mixin defined
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS Performance interface object length
PASS Performance interface object name
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS Performance interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS Performance interface: operation now()
PASS Performance interface: attribute timeOrigin
PASS Performance interface: operation toJSON()
PASS Performance must be primary interface of performance
PASS Stringification of performance
PASS Performance interface: performance must inherit property "now()" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: performance must inherit property "timeOrigin" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: performance must inherit property "toJSON()" with the proper type
PASS Test default toJSON operation of Performance
PASS Window interface: existence and properties of interface object
FAIL WorkerGlobalScope interface: attribute performance assert_equals: setter must be function for PutForwards, Replaceable, or non-readonly attributes expected "function" but got "undefined"
PASS WorkerGlobalScope interface: self must inherit property "performance" with the proper type
Harness: the test ran to completion.
