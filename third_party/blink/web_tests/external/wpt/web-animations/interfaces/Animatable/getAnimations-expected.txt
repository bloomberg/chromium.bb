This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Returns an empty array for an element with no animations
PASS Returns both animations for an element with two animations
PASS Returns only the animations specific to each sibling element
PASS Returns only the animations specific to each parent/child element
FAIL Returns animations on descendants when subtree: true is specified assert_array_equals: Returns expected animations from parent lengths differ, expected 3 got 0
FAIL Returns animations on pseudo-elements when subtree: true is specified assert_equals: Returns one animation when subtree is true expected 1 but got 0
FAIL Does NOT cross shadow-tree boundaries when subtree: true is specified assert_equals: Returns one animation when called on a parent in the shadow tree expected 1 but got 0
PASS Returns animations for a foreign element
PASS Does not return finished animations that do not fill forwards
PASS Returns finished animations that fill forwards
PASS Returns animations yet to reach their active phase
FAIL Does not return reversed finished animations that do not fill backwards assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected 0 got 1
PASS Returns reversed finished animations that fill backwards
FAIL Returns reversed animations yet to reach their active phase assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected 1 got 0
FAIL Does not return animations with zero playback rate in before phase assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected 0 got 1
PASS Does not return animations with zero playback rate in after phase
PASS Returns animations based on dynamic changes to individual animations' duration
PASS Returns animations based on dynamic changes to individual animations' end delay
PASS Returns animations based on dynamic changes to individual animations' iteration count
PASS Returns animations based on dynamic changes to individual animations' current time
FAIL Does not return an animation that has been removed assert_array_equals: lengths differ, expected 1 got 2
FAIL Returns an animation that has been persisted promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: animA.persist is not a function"
PASS Triggers a style change event
Harness: the test ran to completion.
