This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Test setting target before constructing the associated animation
PASS Test setting target from null to a valid target
PASS Test setting target from a valid target to null
PASS Test setting target from a valid target to another target
PASS Target element can be set to a foreign element
FAIL Change target from null to an existing pseudoElement setting target first. assert_equals: Value at 50% progress after setting new target expected "50px" but got "10px"
FAIL Change target from null to an existing pseudoElement setting pseudoElement first. assert_equals: Value at 50% progress after setting new target expected "50px" but got "10px"
PASS Change target from an existing pseudo-element to the originating element.
FAIL Change target from an existing to a different existing pseudo-element by setting target. assert_equals: Animation targets specified pseudo-element (pseudo-selector) expected (string) "::before" but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL Change target from an existing to a different existing pseudo-element by setting pseudoElement. assert_equals: Value of 2nd element (currently targeted) after changing the effect target expected "50px" but got "20px"
FAIL Change target from a non-existing to a different existing pseudo-element by setting target. assert_equals: Animation targets specified pseudo-element (pseudo-selector) expected (string) "::before" but got (undefined) undefined
FAIL Change target from a non-existing to a different existing pseudo-element by setting pseudoElement. assert_equals: Value of 2nd element (currently targeted) after changing the effect target expected "50px" but got "20px"
FAIL Change target from null to a non-existing pseudoElement setting target first. assert_equals: Value at 50% progress after setting new target expected "50px" but got "10px"
FAIL Change target from null to a non-existing pseudoElement setting pseudoElement first. assert_equals: Value at 50% progress after setting new target expected "50px" but got "10px"
PASS Change target from a non-existing pseudo-element to the originating element.
FAIL Change target from an existing to a different non-existing pseudo-element by setting target. assert_equals: Animation targets specified pseudo-element (pseudo-selector) expected (string) "::before" but got (undefined) undefined
