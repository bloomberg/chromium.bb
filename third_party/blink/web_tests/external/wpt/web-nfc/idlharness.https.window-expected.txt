This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS idl_test setup
PASS Partial interface Navigator: original interface defined
FAIL NFCWriter interface: existence and properties of interface object assert_own_property: self does not have own property "NFCWriter" expected property "NFCWriter" missing
FAIL NFCWriter interface object length assert_own_property: self does not have own property "NFCWriter" expected property "NFCWriter" missing
FAIL NFCWriter interface object name assert_own_property: self does not have own property "NFCWriter" expected property "NFCWriter" missing
FAIL NFCWriter interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_own_property: self does not have own property "NFCWriter" expected property "NFCWriter" missing
FAIL NFCWriter interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property assert_own_property: self does not have own property "NFCWriter" expected property "NFCWriter" missing
FAIL NFCWriter interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property assert_own_property: self does not have own property "NFCWriter" expected property "NFCWriter" missing
FAIL NFCWriter interface: operation push(NFCMessageSource, NFCPushOptions) assert_own_property: self does not have own property "NFCWriter" expected property "NFCWriter" missing
PASS NFC interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS NFC interface object length
PASS NFC interface object name
PASS NFC interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS NFC interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS NFC interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS NFC interface: operation watch(MessageCallback, NFCWatchOptions)
PASS NFC must be primary interface of navigator.nfc
PASS Stringification of navigator.nfc
PASS NFC interface: navigator.nfc must inherit property "watch(MessageCallback, NFCWatchOptions)" with the proper type
PASS NFC interface: calling watch(MessageCallback, NFCWatchOptions) on navigator.nfc with too few arguments must throw TypeError
PASS Navigator interface: attribute nfc
PASS Navigator interface: navigator must inherit property "nfc" with the proper type
Harness: the test ran to completion.
