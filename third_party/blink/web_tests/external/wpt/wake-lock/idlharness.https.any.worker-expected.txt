PASS idl_test validation
PASS WakeLock interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS WakeLock interface object length
PASS WakeLock interface object name
PASS WakeLock interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS WakeLock interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS WakeLock interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
PASS WakeLock interface: member requestPermission
FAIL WakeLock interface: operation request(WakeLockType, WakeLockRequestOptions) assert_own_property: interface object missing static operation expected property "request" missing
PASS WakeLock must be primary interface of navigator.wakeLock
PASS Stringification of navigator.wakeLock
PASS WakeLock interface: navigator.wakeLock must not have property "requestPermission"
PASS WakeLock interface: navigator.wakeLock must inherit property "request(WakeLockType, WakeLockRequestOptions)" with the proper type
FAIL WakeLock interface: calling request(WakeLockType, WakeLockRequestOptions) on navigator.wakeLock with too few arguments must throw TypeError assert_own_property: interface object must have static operation as own property expected property "request" missing
Harness: the test ran to completion.
