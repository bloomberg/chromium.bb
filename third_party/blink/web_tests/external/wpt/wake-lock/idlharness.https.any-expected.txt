FAIL WakeLock interface: existence and properties of interface object assert_equals: prototype of self's property "WakeLock" is not Function.prototype expected function "function () { [native code] }" but got function "function EventTarget() { [native code] }"
PASS WakeLock interface object length
PASS WakeLock interface object name
FAIL WakeLock interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: prototype of WakeLock.prototype is not Object.prototype expected object "[object Object]" but got object "[object EventTarget]"

FAIL WakeLock must be primary interface of new WakeLock("screen") assert_equals: Unexpected exception when evaluating object expected null but got object "TypeError: Illegal constructor"
FAIL Stringification of new WakeLock("screen") assert_equals: Unexpected exception when evaluating object expected null but got object "TypeError: Illegal constructor"
FAIL WakeLock interface: new WakeLock("screen") must inherit property "requestPermission(WakeLockType)" with the proper type assert_equals: Unexpected exception when evaluating object expected null but got object "TypeError: Illegal constructor"
FAIL WakeLock interface: calling requestPermission(WakeLockType) on new WakeLock("screen") with too few arguments must throw TypeError assert_equals: Unexpected exception when evaluating object expected null but got object "TypeError: Illegal constructor"
FAIL WakeLock interface: new WakeLock("screen") must inherit property "request(WakeLockType, WakeLockRequestOptions)" with the proper type assert_equals: Unexpected exception when evaluating object expected null but got object "TypeError: Illegal constructor"
