This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Creating first data channel should fire negotiationneeded event
PASS calling createDataChannel twice should fire negotiationneeded event once
PASS addTransceiver() should fire negotiationneeded event
FAIL Calling addTransceiver() twice should fire negotiationneeded event once assert_unreached: Pending promise should never be resolved. Instead it is fulfilled with: [object Object] Reached unreachable code
FAIL Calling both addTransceiver() and createDataChannel() should fire negotiationneeded event once assert_unreached: Pending promise should never be resolved. Instead it is fulfilled with: [object Object] Reached unreachable code
PASS negotiationneeded event should not fire if signaling state is not stable
FAIL negotiationneeded event should fire only after signaling state go back to stable assert_unreached: Expect negotiationneeded promise to resolve after pc has set remote answer and go back to stable state Reached unreachable code
Harness: the test ran to completion.
