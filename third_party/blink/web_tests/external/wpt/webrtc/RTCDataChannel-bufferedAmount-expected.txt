This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS bufferedAmount should increase to byte length of encoded unicode string sent
PASS bufferedAmount should increase to byte length of buffer sent
FAIL bufferedAmount should increase to size of blob sent promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet"
FAIL bufferedAmount should increase by byte length for each message sent assert_unreached: Unexpected promise rejection: NotSupportedError: Failed to execute 'send' on 'RTCDataChannel': Blob support not implemented yet Reached unreachable code
PASS Data channel bufferedamountlow event fires after send() is complete
PASS Data channel bufferedamount is data.length on send(data)
PASS Data channel bufferedamount returns the same amount if no more data is sent on the channel
PASS Data channel bufferedamountlow event fires only once after multiple consecutive send() calls
PASS Data channel bufferedamountlow event fires after each sent message
Harness: the test ran to completion.
