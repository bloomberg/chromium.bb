This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Magnetometer: sensor is suspended and resumed when focus traverses from to cross-origin frame
PASS Magnetometer: sensor is not suspended when focus traverses from to same-origin frame
PASS Magnetometer: losing a document's frame with an active sensor does not crash
FAIL UncalibratedMagnetometer: sensor is suspended and resumed when focus traverses from to cross-origin frame assert_true: expected true got false
FAIL UncalibratedMagnetometer: sensor is not suspended when focus traverses from to same-origin frame assert_true: expected true got false
FAIL UncalibratedMagnetometer: losing a document's frame with an active sensor does not crash assert_true: expected true got false
Harness: the test ran to completion.
