This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Check Response's clone with default values, without body
PASS Check Response's clone has the expected attribute values
PASS Check orginal response's body after cloning
PASS Check cloned response's body
PASS Cannot clone a disturbed response
FAIL Cloned responses should provide the same data assert_array_equals: cloned responses should provide the same data value is object "[object ArrayBuffer]", expected array
PASS Cancelling stream should not affect cloned one
