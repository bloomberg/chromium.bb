This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Property grid-auto-flow value 'row' computes to 'row'
PASS Property grid-auto-flow value 'column' computes to 'column'
FAIL Property grid-auto-flow value 'row dense' computes to 'dense' assert_equals: expected "dense" but got "row dense"
PASS Property grid-auto-flow value 'column dense' computes to 'column dense'
FAIL Property grid-auto-flow value 'dense row' computes to 'dense' assert_equals: expected "dense" but got "row dense"
PASS Property grid-auto-flow value 'dense column' computes to 'column dense'
FAIL Property grid-auto-flow value 'dense' computes to 'dense' assert_equals: expected "dense" but got "row dense"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
