This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Property alignment-baseline value 'baseline' computes to 'baseline'
FAIL Property alignment-baseline value 'text-bottom' computes to 'text-bottom' assert_equals: expected "text-bottom" but got "auto"
PASS Property alignment-baseline value 'alphabetic' computes to 'alphabetic'
PASS Property alignment-baseline value 'ideographic' computes to 'ideographic'
PASS Property alignment-baseline value 'middle' computes to 'middle'
PASS Property alignment-baseline value 'central' computes to 'central'
PASS Property alignment-baseline value 'mathematical' computes to 'mathematical'
FAIL Property alignment-baseline value 'text-top' computes to 'text-top' assert_equals: expected "text-top" but got "auto"
FAIL Property alignment-baseline value 'bottom' computes to 'bottom' assert_equals: expected "bottom" but got "auto"
FAIL Property alignment-baseline value 'center' computes to 'center' assert_equals: expected "center" but got "auto"
FAIL Property alignment-baseline value 'top' computes to 'top' assert_equals: expected "top" but got "auto"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
