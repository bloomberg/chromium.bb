This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS cubic-bezier easing with input progress greater than 1
FAIL cubic-bezier easing with input progress greater than 1 and where the tangent on the upper boundary is infinity assert_approx_equals: The left of the animation should be approximately 100 at 240ms expected 100 +/- 0.01 but got 99.5248
PASS cubic-bezier easing with input progress less than 0
PASS cubic-bezier easing with input progress less than 0 and where the tangent on the lower boundary is infinity
Harness: the test ran to completion.
