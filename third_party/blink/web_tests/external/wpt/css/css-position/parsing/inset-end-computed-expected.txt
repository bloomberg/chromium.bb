This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Property inset-end value 'auto' computes to 'auto' assert_true: inset-end doesn't seem to be supported in the computed style expected true got false
FAIL Property inset-end value 'calc(10px + 0.5em)' computes to '30px' assert_true: inset-end doesn't seem to be supported in the computed style expected true got false
FAIL Property inset-end value 'calc(10px - 0.5em)' computes to '-10px' assert_true: inset-end doesn't seem to be supported in the computed style expected true got false
FAIL Property inset-end value '-40%' computes to '-40%' assert_true: inset-end doesn't seem to be supported in the computed style expected true got false
FAIL Property inset-end value 'calc(50% + 60px)' computes to 'calc(50% + 60px)' assert_true: inset-end doesn't seem to be supported in the computed style expected true got false
