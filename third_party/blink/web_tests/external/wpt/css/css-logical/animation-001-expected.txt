This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Logical properties can be animated using object notation assert_equals: expected "50px" but got "100px"
FAIL Logical properties can be animated using array notation assert_equals: expected "50px" but got "100px"
PASS Logical properties are NOT stored as physical properties
FAIL Logical properties in animations respect the writing-mode assert_equals: expected "50px" but got "100px"
FAIL Logical properties in animations respect the direction assert_equals: expected "50px" but got "100px"
PASS Physical properties win over logical properties in object notation
PASS Physical properties win over logical properties in array notation
PASS Physical properties with variables win over logical properties
FAIL Logical shorthands follow the usual prioritization based on number of component longhands assert_equals: expected "300px" but got "0px"
FAIL Physical longhands win over logical shorthands assert_equals: expected "200px" but got "100px"
PASS Logical longhands win over physical shorthands
FAIL Physical shorthands win over logical shorthands assert_equals: expected "200px" but got "100px"
FAIL Physical shorthands using variables win over logical shorthands assert_equals: expected "200px" but got "100px"
FAIL Physical properties and logical properties can be mixed assert_equals: expected "250px" but got "300px"
FAIL Physical shorthands and logical shorthands can be mixed assert_equals: expected "250px" but got "150px"
PASS Physical properties win over logical properties even when some keyframes only have logical properties
FAIL Animations update when the writing-mode is changed assert_equals: expected "50px" but got "100px"
PASS Filling animations update when the writing-mode is changed
FAIL Animations with implicit from values update when the writing-mode is changed assert_equals: expected "250px" but got "300px"
FAIL Animations with overlapping physical and logical properties update when the writing-mode is changed assert_equals: expected "50px" but got "100px"
FAIL Animations update when the writing-mode is changed through a CSS variable assert_equals: expected "50px" but got "100px"
FAIL Animations update when the direction is changed assert_equals: expected "50px" but got "100px"
PASS writing-mode is not animatable
PASS direction is not animatable
Harness: the test ran to completion.
