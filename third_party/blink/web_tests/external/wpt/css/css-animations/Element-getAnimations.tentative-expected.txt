PASS getAnimations for non-animated content
PASS getAnimations for CSS Animations
PASS getAnimations returns CSSAnimation objects for CSS Animations
PASS getAnimations for multi-property animations
FAIL getAnimations for both CSS Animations and CSS Transitions at once assert_class_string: First-returned animation is the CSS Transition expected "[object CSSTransition]" but got "[object CSSAnimation]"
PASS getAnimations for CSS Animations that have finished
PASS getAnimations for CSS Animations that have finished but are forwards filling
PASS getAnimations for CSS Animations with animation-name: none
PASS getAnimations for CSS Animations with animation-name: missing
PASS getAnimations for CSS Animations where the @keyframes rule is added later
PASS getAnimations for CSS Animations with duplicated animation-name
PASS getAnimations for CSS Animations with empty keyframes rule
PASS getAnimations for CSS animations in delay phase
PASS getAnimations for zero-duration CSS Animations
PASS getAnimations returns objects with the same identity
PASS getAnimations for CSS Animations that are canceled
FAIL getAnimations for CSS Animations follows animation-name order assert_equals: animation order after prepending to list expected "anim1" but got "anim2"
PASS { subtree: false } on a leaf element returns the element's animations and ignore pseudo-elements
FAIL { subtree: true } on a leaf element returns the element's animations and its pseudo-elements' animations assert_equals: The animation targeting the parent element should be returned first expected (object) null but got (undefined) undefined
PASS { subtree: false } on an element with a child returns only the element's animations
FAIL { subtree: true } on an element with a child returns animations from the element, its pseudo-elements, its child and its child pseudo-elements assert_equals: The animation targeting the parent element should be returned first expected (object) null but got (undefined) undefined
PASS { subtree: true } on an element with many descendants returns animations from all the descendants
Harness: the test ran to completion.
