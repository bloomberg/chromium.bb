PASS Property tab-size value '4' computes to '4'
FAIL Property tab-size value '2.5' computes to '2.5' assert_equals: expected "2.5" but got "8"
PASS Property tab-size value '0px' computes to '0px'
PASS Property tab-size value '10px' computes to '10px'
PASS Property tab-size value 'calc(10px + 0.5em)' computes to '30px'
PASS Property tab-size value 'calc(10px - 0.5em)' computes to '0px'
