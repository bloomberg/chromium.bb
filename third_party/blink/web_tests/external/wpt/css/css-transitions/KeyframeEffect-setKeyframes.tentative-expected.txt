This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Keyframes set using setKeyframes() are reflected in computed style for a running transition
PASS A transition with replaced keyframes still returns the original transitionProperty
PASS A transition with no keyframes still returns the original transitionProperty
FAIL A transition with replaced keyframes still exhibits the regular transition reversing behavior Cannot read property 'effect' of undefined
FAIL A transition with no keyframes still exhibits the regular transition reversing behavior Cannot read property 'effect' of undefined
Harness: the test ran to completion.
