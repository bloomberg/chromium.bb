This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL A 'frame-ancestors' CSP directive with a URL value should compare against each frame's origin rather than URL, so a nested frame with a sandboxed parent frame should be blocked due to the parent having a unique origin. assert_unreached: Inner IFrame msg: undefined Reached unreachable code
Harness: the test ran to completion.
