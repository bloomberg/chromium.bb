PASS Unmapped built-in module specifiers / should resolve "std:blank" to "std:blank"
FAIL Unmapped built-in module specifiers / should error resolving "std:none" assert_throws: function "() => resolveUnderTest(NONE)" did not throw
PASS Remapping built-in module specifiers / should remap built-in modules
FAIL Remapping built-in module specifiers / should remap built-in modules with slashes assert_equals: expected "https://example.com/app/blank-slash/bar" but got "std:blank/bar"
FAIL Remapping built-in module specifiers / should remap built-in modules with fallbacks Failed to resolve module specifier std:blank: Import Map: "std:blank" matches with "std:blank" but fails to be mapped (no viable URLs)
FAIL Remapping built-in module specifiers / should remap built-in modules with slashes and fallbacks Failed to resolve module specifier std:blank/: Import Map: "std:blank/" matches with "std:blank/" but fails to be mapped (no viable URLs)
PASS Remapping to built-in modules / should remap to "std:blank"
PASS Remapping to built-in modules / should fail when remapping to "std:blank/"
FAIL Remapping to built-in modules / should remap to "std:blank/for-testing" assert_equals: expected "std:blank/for-testing" but got "https://example.com/blank/for-testing"
PASS Remapping to built-in modules / should remap to "std:blank" for URL-like specifiers
PASS Remapping to built-in modules / should fail when remapping to "std:none"
FAIL Fallbacks with built-in module addresses / should resolve to "std:blank" Failed to resolve module specifier blank: Import Map: "blank" matches with "blank" but fails to be mapped (no viable URLs)
FAIL Fallbacks with built-in module addresses / should fall back past "std:none" Failed to resolve module specifier none: Import Map: "none" matches with "none" but fails to be mapped (no viable URLs)
