This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS idl_test setup
PASS Partial namespace CSS: original namespace defined
PASS Partial interface AnimationEffect: original interface defined
FAIL Partial interface AnimationEffect: valid exposure set Partial AnimationEffect interface is exposed to 'AnimationWorklet', the original interface is not.
PASS AnimationWorkletGlobalScope interface: existence and properties of interface object
FAIL WorkletAnimation interface: existence and properties of interface object assert_equals: prototype of WorkletAnimation is not Animation expected function "function Animation() { [native code] }" but got function "function () { [native code] }"
FAIL WorkletAnimation interface object length assert_equals: wrong value for WorkletAnimation.length expected 1 but got 2
PASS WorkletAnimation interface object name
FAIL WorkletAnimation interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_equals: prototype of WorkletAnimation.prototype is not Animation.prototype expected object "[object Animation]" but got object "[object Object]"
PASS WorkletAnimation interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS WorkletAnimation interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
FAIL WorkletAnimation interface: attribute animatorName assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "animatorName" expected true got false
FAIL WorkletAnimation must be primary interface of new WorkletAnimation("name") assert_equals: Unexpected exception when evaluating object expected null but got object "TypeError: Failed to construct 'WorkletAnimation': 2 arguments required, but only 1 present."
FAIL Stringification of new WorkletAnimation("name") assert_equals: Unexpected exception when evaluating object expected null but got object "TypeError: Failed to construct 'WorkletAnimation': 2 arguments required, but only 1 present."
FAIL WorkletAnimation interface: new WorkletAnimation("name") must inherit property "animatorName" with the proper type assert_equals: Unexpected exception when evaluating object expected null but got object "TypeError: Failed to construct 'WorkletAnimation': 2 arguments required, but only 1 present."
FAIL WorkletGroupEffect interface: existence and properties of interface object assert_own_property: self does not have own property "WorkletGroupEffect" expected property "WorkletGroupEffect" missing
FAIL WorkletGroupEffect interface object length assert_own_property: self does not have own property "WorkletGroupEffect" expected property "WorkletGroupEffect" missing
FAIL WorkletGroupEffect interface object name assert_own_property: self does not have own property "WorkletGroupEffect" expected property "WorkletGroupEffect" missing
FAIL WorkletGroupEffect interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object assert_own_property: self does not have own property "WorkletGroupEffect" expected property "WorkletGroupEffect" missing
FAIL WorkletGroupEffect interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property assert_own_property: self does not have own property "WorkletGroupEffect" expected property "WorkletGroupEffect" missing
FAIL WorkletGroupEffect interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property assert_own_property: self does not have own property "WorkletGroupEffect" expected property "WorkletGroupEffect" missing
FAIL WorkletGroupEffect interface: operation getChildren() assert_own_property: self does not have own property "WorkletGroupEffect" expected property "WorkletGroupEffect" missing
PASS WorkletGlobalScope interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS AnimationEffect interface: member localTime
PASS CSS namespace: operation escape(CSSOMString)
FAIL CSS namespace: attribute animationWorklet assert_own_property: CSS does not have property "animationWorklet" expected property "animationWorklet" missing
Harness: the test ran to completion.
