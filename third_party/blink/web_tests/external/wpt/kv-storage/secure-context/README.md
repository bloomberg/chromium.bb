# KV Storage `[SecureContext]` tests

These tests ensure that KV Storage follows the rules for `[SecureContext]` modules. (As of the time of this writing, they are only proposed rules, in [heycam/webidl#675](https://github.com/heycam/webidl/pull/675).)

Eventually these should probably be generalized and tested as part of `idlharness.js`.
