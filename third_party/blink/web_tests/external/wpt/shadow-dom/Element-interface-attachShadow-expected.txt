FAIL Element.attachShadow must throw a NotSupportedError if the context object already hosts a shadow tree assert_throws: Calling attachShadow({mode: "open"}) twice on the same element must throw function "function () {
        var div = document.createElement('div');
        div.attachShadow({mode: "open"});
        div.attachShadow({mode: "open"});
    }" threw object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'attachShadow' on 'Element': Shadow root cannot be created on a host which already hosts a shadow tree." ("InvalidStateError") expected object "[object Object]" ("NotSupportedError")
