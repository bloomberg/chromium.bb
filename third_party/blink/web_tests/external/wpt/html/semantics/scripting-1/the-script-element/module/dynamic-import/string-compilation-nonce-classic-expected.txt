This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL setTimeout must inherit the nonce from the triggering script, thus execute assert_true: The module must have been evaluated expected true got undefined
PASS direct eval must inherit the nonce from the triggering script, thus execute
PASS indirect eval must inherit the nonce from the triggering script, thus execute
PASS the Function constructor must inherit the nonce from the triggering script, thus execute
FAIL reflected inline event handlers must inherit the nonce from the triggering script, thus execute promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://web-platform.test:8001/html/semantics/scripting-1/the-script-element/module/imports-a.js?label=reflected%20inline%20event%20handlers"
FAIL inline event handlers triggered via UA code must inherit the nonce from the triggering script, thus execute promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://web-platform.test:8001/html/semantics/scripting-1/the-script-element/module/imports-a.js?label=inline%20event%20handlers%20triggered%20via%20UA%20code"
Harness: the test ran to completion.
