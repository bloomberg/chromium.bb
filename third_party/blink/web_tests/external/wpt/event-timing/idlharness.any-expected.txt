FAIL EventCounts interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property assert_own_property: self does not have own property "EventCounts" expected property "EventCounts" missing
FAIL Performance interface: attribute eventCounts assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "eventCounts" expected true got false
FAIL Performance interface: performance must inherit property "eventCounts" with the proper type assert_inherits: property "eventCounts" not found in prototype chain
Harness: the test ran to completion.
