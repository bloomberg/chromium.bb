This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Parameterless SLD() in 'stable' goes to 'have-local-offer'
PASS Parameterless SLD() in 'stable' sets pendingLocalDescription
FAIL Parameterless SLD() in 'stable' assigns transceiver.mid promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
PASS Parameterless SLD() in 'have-remote-offer' goes to 'stable'
PASS Parameterless SLD() in 'have-remote-offer' sets currentLocalDescription
FAIL Parameterless SLD() in 'have-remote-offer' sets transceiver.currentDirection promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL Parameterless SLD() uses [[LastCreatedOffer]] if it is still valid assert_true: offerer.pendingLocalDescription.sdp == offer.sdp expected true got false
FAIL Parameterless SLD() uses [[LastCreatedAnswer]] if it is still valid assert_true: answerer.currentLocalDescription.sdp == answer.sdp expected true got false
PASS Parameterless SLD() never resolves if already closed
PASS Parameterless SLD() never resolves if closed while pending
PASS Parameterless SLD() in a full O/A exchange succeeds
Harness: the test ran to completion.
