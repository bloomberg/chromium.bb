This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL A transceiver added and stopped before the initial offer generation should not trigger an offer m-section generation promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL During renegotiation, adding and stopping a transceiver should not trigger a renegotiated offer m-section generation promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL A stopped sendonly transceiver should generate a sendonly m-section in the offer promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
FAIL A stopped inactive transceiver should generate an inactive m-section in the offer promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'addTransceiver' on 'RTCPeerConnection': This operation is only supported in 'unified-plan'."
