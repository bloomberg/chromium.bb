This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Number should be rejected as the mark-options. assert_throws: Number passed as a dict argument should cause type-error. function "function() { self.performance.mark("mark1", 123); }" did not throw
FAIL NaN should be rejected as the mark-options. assert_throws: NaN passed as a dict argument should cause type-error. function "function() { self.performance.mark("mark1", NaN); }" did not throw
FAIL Infinity should be rejected as the mark-options. assert_throws: Infinity passed as a dict argument should cause type-error. function "function() { self.performance.mark("mark1", Infinity); }" did not throw
FAIL String should be rejected as the mark-options. assert_throws: String passed as a dict argument should cause type-error. function "function() { self.performance.mark("mark1", "string"); }" did not throw
