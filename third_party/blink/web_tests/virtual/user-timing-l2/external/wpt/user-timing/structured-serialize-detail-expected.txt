    }" did not throw
FAIL The detail property in the measure method should be structured-clone. Failed to execute 'measure' on 'Performance': The mark '[object Object]' does not exist.

FAIL Measure: Throw an exception when the detail property cannot be structured-serialized. assert_throws: Trying to structured-serialize a Symbol. function "()=>{
      performance.measure("A", { detail });
    }" threw object "SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'measure' on 'Performance': The mark '[object Object]' does not exist." that is not a DOMException DataCloneError: property "code" is equal to 12, expected 25
