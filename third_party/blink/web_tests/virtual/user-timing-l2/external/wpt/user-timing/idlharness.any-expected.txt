This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS idl_test setup
PASS Partial interface Performance: original interface defined
PASS PerformanceMark interface: existence and properties of interface object
FAIL PerformanceMark interface object length assert_equals: wrong value for PerformanceMark.length expected 1 but got 0
PASS PerformanceMark interface object name
PASS PerformanceMark interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS PerformanceMark interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS PerformanceMark interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
FAIL PerformanceMark interface: attribute detail assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "detail" expected true got false
PASS PerformanceMark must be primary interface of mark
PASS Stringification of mark
FAIL PerformanceMark interface: mark must inherit property "detail" with the proper type assert_inherits: property "detail" not found in prototype chain
PASS PerformanceMeasure interface: existence and properties of interface object
PASS PerformanceMeasure interface object length
PASS PerformanceMeasure interface object name
PASS PerformanceMeasure interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object
PASS PerformanceMeasure interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's "constructor" property
PASS PerformanceMeasure interface: existence and properties of interface prototype object's @@unscopables property
FAIL PerformanceMeasure interface: attribute detail assert_true: The prototype object must have a property "detail" expected true got false
PASS PerformanceMeasure must be primary interface of measure
PASS Stringification of measure
FAIL PerformanceMeasure interface: measure must inherit property "detail" with the proper type assert_inherits: property "detail" not found in prototype chain
PASS Performance interface: operation mark(DOMString, PerformanceMarkOptions)
PASS Performance interface: operation clearMarks(DOMString)
PASS Performance interface: operation measure(DOMString, [object Object],[object Object], DOMString)
PASS Performance interface: operation clearMeasures(DOMString)
PASS Performance interface: performance must inherit property "mark(DOMString, PerformanceMarkOptions)" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: calling mark(DOMString, PerformanceMarkOptions) on performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError
PASS Performance interface: performance must inherit property "clearMarks(DOMString)" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: calling clearMarks(DOMString) on performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError
PASS Performance interface: performance must inherit property "measure(DOMString, [object Object],[object Object], DOMString)" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: calling measure(DOMString, [object Object],[object Object], DOMString) on performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError
PASS Performance interface: performance must inherit property "clearMeasures(DOMString)" with the proper type
PASS Performance interface: calling clearMeasures(DOMString) on performance with too few arguments must throw TypeError
Harness: the test ran to completion.
