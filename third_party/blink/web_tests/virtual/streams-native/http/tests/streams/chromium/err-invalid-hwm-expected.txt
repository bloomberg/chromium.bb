This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL ReadableStream RangeError on invalid highWaterMark should have an appropriate message assert_equals: message should be relevant expected "A queueing strategy's highWaterMark property must be a nonnegative, non-NaN number" but got "Failed to construct 'ReadableStream': A queuing strategy's highWaterMark property must be a nonnegative, non-NaN number"
FAIL WritableStream RangeError on invalid highWaterMark should have an appropriate message assert_equals: message should be relevant expected "A queueing strategy's highWaterMark property must be a nonnegative, non-NaN number" but got "Failed to construct 'WritableStream': A queuing strategy's highWaterMark property must be a nonnegative, non-NaN number"
