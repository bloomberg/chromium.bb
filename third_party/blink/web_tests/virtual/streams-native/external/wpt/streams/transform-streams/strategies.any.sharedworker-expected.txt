This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL writableStrategy highWaterMark should work Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
FAIL readableStrategy highWaterMark should work Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
FAIL writable should have the correct size() function Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
FAIL default writable strategy should be equivalent to { highWaterMark: 1 } Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
FAIL default readable strategy should be equivalent to { highWaterMark: 0 } Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
FAIL a RangeError should be thrown for an invalid highWaterMark assert_throws: should throw RangeError for negative writableHighWaterMark function "() => new TransformStream(undefined, { highWaterMark: -1 })" threw object "TypeError: Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled" ("TypeError") expected object "RangeError" ("RangeError")
FAIL writableStrategy highWaterMark should be converted to a number Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
FAIL readableStrategy highWaterMark should be converted to a number Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
FAIL a bad readableStrategy size function should cause writer.write() to reject on an identity transform Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
FAIL a bad readableStrategy size function should error the stream on enqueue even when transformer.transform() catches the exception Failed to construct 'TransformStream': TransformStream disabled because StreamsNative is enabled
Harness: the test ran to completion.
