This is a testharness.js-based test.
FAIL Piping must lock both the ReadableStream and WritableStream assert_true: the ReadableStream must become locked expected true got false
FAIL Piping finishing must unlock both the ReadableStream and WritableStream promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'pipeTo' on 'ReadableStream': pipeTo disabled because StreamsNative feature is enabled"
PASS pipeTo must check the brand of its ReadableStream this value
PASS pipeTo must check the brand of its WritableStream argument
PASS pipeTo must fail if the ReadableStream is locked, and not lock the WritableStream
PASS pipeTo must fail if the WritableStream is locked, and not lock the ReadableStream
FAIL Piping from a ReadableStream from which lots of chunks are synchronously readable promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'pipeTo' on 'ReadableStream': pipeTo disabled because StreamsNative feature is enabled"
FAIL Piping from a ReadableStream for which a chunk becomes asynchronously readable after the pipeTo promise_test: Unhandled rejection with value: object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'pipeTo' on 'ReadableStream': pipeTo disabled because StreamsNative feature is enabled"
FAIL an undefined rejection from pull should cause pipeTo() to reject when preventAbort is true assert_equals: rejection value should be undefined expected (undefined) undefined but got (object) object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'pipeTo' on 'ReadableStream': pipeTo disabled because StreamsNative feature is enabled"
FAIL an undefined rejection from pull should cause pipeTo() to reject when preventAbort is false assert_equals: rejection value should be undefined expected (undefined) undefined but got (object) object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'pipeTo' on 'ReadableStream': pipeTo disabled because StreamsNative feature is enabled"
FAIL an undefined rejection from write should cause pipeTo() to reject when preventCancel is true assert_equals: rejection value should be undefined expected (undefined) undefined but got (object) object "TypeError: Failed to execute 'pipeTo' on 'ReadableStream': pipeTo disabled because StreamsNative feature is enabled"

Harness: the test ran to completion.
