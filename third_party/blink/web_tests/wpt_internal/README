This directory is the internal counterpart of external/wpt. All WPT features are
enabled in this directory, including wptserve: this directory is mapped to
wpt_staging/ on wptserve.

Tests in this directory can use Blink internal testing APIs (`wpt lint` is NOT
enforced in this directory), and they will not be exported to upstream. Please
try to use external/wpt whenever possible.

Note: tests have to go into subdirectories. Files in the root level of
wpt_internal are not recognized as tests.
