This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS high importance on dynamically-inserted <script>s translates to kHigh resource load priority
PASS low importance on dynamically-inserted <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS auto importance on dynamically-inserted <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS invalid importance on dynamically-inserted <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS missing importance on dynamically-inserted <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS high importance on dynamically-inserted module <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
FAIL low importance on dynamically-inserted module <script>s translates to kLow resource load priority assert_equals: expected 1 but got 3
PASS auto importance on dynamically-inserted module <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS invalid importance on dynamically-inserted module <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
PASS missing importance on dynamically-inserted module <script>s has no effect on resource load priority
Harness: the test ran to completion.
