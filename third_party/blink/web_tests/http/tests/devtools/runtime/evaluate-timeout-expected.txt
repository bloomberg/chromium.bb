Test frontend's timeout support.


Testing expression while (1){} with timeout: 0
error: Execution was terminated
{
    error : "Execution was terminated"
}

Testing expression 1 + 1 with timeout: undefined
{
    exceptionDetails : undefined
    object : {
        _className : null
        _customPreview : null
        _description : "2"
        _hasChildren : false
        _runtimeAgent : <object>
        _runtimeModel : <object>
        _subtype : undefined
        _type : "number"
        _value : 2
    }
}

Does the runtime also support side effect checks? true
