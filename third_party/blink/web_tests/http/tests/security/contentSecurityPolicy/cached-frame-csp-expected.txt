Check that a CSP header added by a 304 response does not override one from the original request.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Check that the nonce is the same, meaning that the document was only generated once:
PASS frame1.contentDocument.querySelector("input").value == frame2.contentDocument.querySelector("input").value is true
PASS successfullyParsed is true

TEST COMPLETE
