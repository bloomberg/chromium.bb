This test checks that loading a subresource with "Cache-Control: max-age=0" is cached and reused in back navigation when the page is not in the page cache.

We then test that loading the same subresource is refetched when used in non-stale loads such as refreshes or normal navigation.

PASS - max-age subresource was cached and used for a back navigation
PASS - max-age subresource was refetched with a reload
PASS - max-age subresource was refetched with a normal navigation
