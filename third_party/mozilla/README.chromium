Security Critical: yes

Description:
  This directory contains the following files come from (Mozilla) Camino
  (src/camino/src/extensions):

    NSPasteboard+Utils.h/mm
    NSScreen+Utils.h/m
    NSString+Utils.h/m
    NSURL+Utils.h/m
    NSWorkspace+Utils.h/m

Local modifications:
- NSURL+Utils.m was modified to use non-deprecated Cocoa APIs to allow
  compilation on modern versions of Mac OS X.
- NSString+Utils.m was renamed to NSString+Utils.mm and modified to use GURL
  for validation in -[NSString isValidURI].
- NSPasteboard+Utils.mm was modified to add an argument to
  -[NSPasteboard getURLs:andTitles:] to determine whether or not filenames in
  the drag should be converted to file URLs.
- -[NSPasteboard getURLs:andTitles:convertingFilenames:convertingTextToURL:]
  was modified to keep going if WebURLsWithTitlesPboardType exists but doesn't
  contain any URLs, which can happen with drags from WebView.
- -[NSPasteboard:containsURLData] and [NSPasteboard getURLs:andTitles:] were
  modified to accept an additional parameter convertingTextToURL:, which
  indicates whether the string contents of the pasteboard should be
  interpreted as a URL if possible.
- -[NSPasteboard htmlFromRtf] was added to do rtf->html conversion.
- NSWorkspace+Utils.m was modified to compile on the x86_64 architecture.
- MOZILLA_EXPORT was added to some constants in NSPasteboard+Utils.h.
- +[NSWorkspace(CaminoDefaultBrowserAdditions) isLeopardOrHigher] hidden since
  it relies on methods deprecated in 10.8 (and is unused in Chrome).
