Description:
The Closure Compiler provides warnings for illegal JavaScript and warnings for
potentially dangerous operations, helping you to produce JavaScript that is less
buggy and easier to maintain.

Local modifications:
- Use the script third_party/closure_compiler/roll_closure_compiler to update
  the versions of third_party/closure_compiler/compiler/compiler.jar and/or
  third_party/closure_compiler/externs/chrome_extensions.js.
- Some externs here are for chrome-specific use; these primarily include the
  *_private.js files.
- Fix bug in js_binary.py causing it to drop externs.
- Cache dependency subtrees in js_binary.py for a huge performance boost.
