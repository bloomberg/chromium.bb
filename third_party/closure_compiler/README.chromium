Description:
The Closure Compiler provides warnings for illegal JavaScript and warnings for
potentially dangerous operations, helping you to produce JavaScript that is less
buggy and easier to maintain.

Local modifications:
- The compiler is run via a custom mechanism (see: runner/) that sets the
  compiler to "IDE mode" (single-file checks, doesn't stop on first error).
- Chrome-specific coding conventions to understand cr.addSingletonGetter().
- third_party/closure_compiler/runner/src/com/google/javascript/jscomp/ChromePass.java
  Added pass to handle namespace definition with cr.define(), object chain
  creation with cr.exportPath() and property definition with
  {cr|Object}.defineProperty().
  See third_party/closure_compiler/runner/how_to_test_compiler_pass.md for
  testing instructions on this pass.
