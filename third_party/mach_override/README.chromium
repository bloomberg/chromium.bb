Description:
This is the mach_override part of mach_star, namely:

  https://github.com/rentzsch/mach_star/tree/51ae3d199463fa84548f466d649f0821d579fdaf

This package is used to replace framework functions with different
implementations at run time.


Local Modifications:

Added the instructions to |possibleInstructions| for the very short
malloc_error_break() on 10.5 so that it can be overriden on that platform.

Print errors using fprintf() to stderr, rather than printf() to stdout.
