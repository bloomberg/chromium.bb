This libjpeg-turbo can replace our libjpeg-6b without any modifications in the
Chromium code.

Same as our copy of libjpeg-6b, this libjpeg-turbo also added a new file
jpeglibmangler.h and included it from jpeglib.h that changes the names of all
externally visible functions to chromium_* so that we can avoid conflicts that
arise when system libraries attempt to use our libjpeg. Also, we applied the
following changes which are not merged to upstream:

* Fix libjpeg_turbo svn r64 libjpeg6b compat issue: make the fast path Huffman
  decoder fallback to slow decoding if the Huffman decoding bit sentinel > 16,
  this to match the exact behavior of jpeg_huff_decode().

  The patch in the above bug removed "& 0xFF". It has been restored from upstream
  https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/commit/fa1d18385d904d530b4aec83ab7757a33397de6e
* Configuration files jconfig.h and jconfigint.h were generated and then altered
  manually to be compatible on all of Chromium's platforms.
