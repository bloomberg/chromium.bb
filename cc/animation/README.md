# cc/animation

[TOC]

## Overview

cc/animation provides animation support - generating output values (usually
visual properties) based on a predefined function and changing input values.
Currently the main clients of cc/animation are Blink and ui/, targeting
composited layers, but the code is intended to be agnostic of the client it is
supporting. Aspirationally we could eventually merge cc/animation and Blink
animation and have only a single animation system for all of Chromium.

This document covers two main topics. The first section explains how
cc/animation actually works: how animations are ticked, what animation curves
are, what the ownership model is, etc. Later sections document how other parts
of Chromium interact with cc/animation, most prominently Blink and ui/.

## How cc/animation works

The root concept in cc/animation is an
[keyframe model](https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/animation/keyframe_model.h).
Animations contain the state necessary to 'play' (interpolate values from) an
[animation curve](https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/animation/animation_curve.h),
which is a function that returns a value given an input time. Aside from the
animation curve itself, an animation's state includes the run state (playing,
paused, etc), the start time, the current direction (forwards, reverse), etc.
An animation does not know or care what property is being animated, and holds
only an opaque identifier for the property to allow clients to map output values
to the correct properties.

Targeting only a single property means that cc KeyframeModels are distinct from the
Blink concept of an animation, which wraps the animation of multiple properties.
To coordinate the playback of multiple cc/animations (e.g. those that are
animating multiple properties on the same target), KeyframeModels have the concept
of a group identifier. Animations that have the same group identifier and the
same target are started together, and animation-finished notifications are only
sent when all animations in the group have finished.

Animations are grouped together based on their
[animation target](https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/animation/animation_target.h)
(the entity whose property is being animated) and each such group is owned by an
[animation](https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/animation/animation.h).
Note that there may be multiple animations with the same target (each
with a set of KeyframeModels for that target); the
[ElementAnimations](https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/animation/element_animations.h)
class wraps the multiple animations and has a 1:1 relationship with
target entities.

`TODO(smcgruer): Why are ElementAnimations and Animations separate?`

In order to play an animation, input time values must be provided to the
animation curve and output values fed back into the animating entity. This is
called 'ticking' an animation and is the responsibility of the
[animation host](https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/animation/animation_host.h).
The animation host has a list of currently ticking animations (i.e. those that have
any non-deleted animations), which it iterates through whenever it receives a
tick call from the client (along with a corresponding input time).  The
animations then call into their non-deleted animations, retrieving the
value from the animation curve.  As they are computed, output values are sent to
the target which is responsible for passing them to the client entity that is
being animated.

### Types of Animation Curve

As noted above, an animation curve is simply a function which converts an input
time value into some output value. Animation curves are categorized based on
their output type, and each such category can have multiple implementations that
provide different conversion functions. There are many categories of animation
curve, but some common ones are `FloatAnimationCurve`, `ColorAnimationCurve`,
and `TransformAnimationCurve`.

The most common implementation of the various animation curve categories are the
[keyframed animation curves](https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/animation/keyframed_animation_curve.h).
These curves each have a set of keyframes which map a specific time to a
specific output value. Producing an output value for a given input time is then
a matter of identifying the two keyframes the time lies between, and
interpolating between the keyframe output values. (Or simply using a keyframe
output value directly, if the input time happens to line up exactly.) Exact
details of how each animation curve category is interpolated can be found in the
implementations.

There is one category of animation curve that stands somewhat apart, the
[scroll offset animation curve](https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/animation/scroll_offset_animation_curve.h).
This curve converts the input time into a scroll offset, interpolating between
an initial scroll offset and an updateable target scroll offset. It has logic to
handle different types of scrolling such as programmatic, keyboard, and mouse
wheel scrolls.

### Animation Timelines

cc/animation has a concept of an
[animation timeline](https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/animation/animation_timeline.h).
This should not be confused with the identically named Blink concept. In
cc/animation, animation timelines are an implementation detail - they hold the
animations and are responsible for syncing them to the impl thread (see
below), but do not participate in the ticking process in any way.

### Main/Impl Threads

One part of cc/animation that is not client agnostic is its support for the
[Chromium compositor thread](https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/README.md).
Most of the cc/animation classes have a `PushPropertiesTo` method, in which they
synchronize necessary state from the main thread to the impl thread. It is
feasible that such support could be abstracted if necessary, but so far it has
not been required.

## Current cc/animation Clients

As noted above, the main clients of cc/animation are currently Blink for
accelerated web animations, and ui/ for accelerated user interface animations.
Both of these clients utilize
[cc::Layer](https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/layers/layer.h)
as their animation entity and interact with cc/animation via the
[MutatorHostClient](https://codesearch.chromium.org/chromium/src/cc/trees/mutator_host_client.h)
interface (which is implemented by cc::LayerTreeHost and cc::LayerTreeHostImpl).
Recently a third client, chrome/browser/vr/, has started using cc/animations as
well. The vr/ client does not use cc::Layer as its animation entity.

`TODO(smcgruer): Summarize how vr/ uses cc/animation.`

### Supported Animatable Properties

As cc::Layers are just textures which are reused for performance, clients that
use composited layers as their animation entities are limited to animating
properties that do not cause content to be redrawn. For example, a composited
layer's opacity can be animated as promoted layers are aware of the content
behind them.  On the other hand we cannot animate layer width as changing the
width could modify layout - which then requires redrawing.

### Interaction between cc/animation and Blink

Blink is able to move compatible animations off the main thread, by promoting
the animating element into a layer. This section gives an overview of the
machinery to move animations to the compositor from Blink. It does not go into
details on the Blink-side of animations.
