// This class wraps a SingleThreadTaskRunner but allows posted tasks to be
// run without a round trip through the message loop. This shortcutting
// removes guarantees about ordering. Tasks posted while the
// BlockingTaskRunner is in a capturing state will run in order, and tasks
// posted while the BlockingTaskRunner is /not/ in a capturing state will
// run in order, but the two sets of tasks will *not* run in order relative
// to when they were posted.
//
// To use this class, post tasks to the task runner returned by
// BlockingTaskRunner::Create(). The thread it is created on identifies the
// thread you want the tasks to run on. The SingleThreadTaskRunner which is
// passed into Create() is used to run tasks that are posted when not in a
// capturing state.
//
// Then, on the thread that the given task runner belongs to, you may
// instantiate a BlockingTaskRunner::CapturePostTasks. While this object
// exists, the task runner will collect any PostTasks called on it, posting
// tasks to that thread from anywhere. This CapturePostTasks object provides
// a window in time where tasks can shortcut past the MessageLoop. As soon
// as the CapturePostTasks object is destroyed (goes out of scope), all
// tasks that had been posted to the thread during the window will be executed
// immediately.
//
// Beware of re-entrancy, make sure the CapturePostTasks object is destroyed at
// a time when it makes sense for the embedder to call arbitrary things.
