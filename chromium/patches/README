Current Status as of Mar 22, 2013


Upstream cherry-picks:
<upstream in progress> - Win64 AVX change to not use redzone in
  libavcodec/x86/h264_deblock.asm.
  TODO(wolenetz): Confirm upstream has the fix in M27 roll.
  TODO(wolenetz): Upstream version of this patch needs to change
  the cglobal stack to be 0x10 on WIN64, 0 on Unix64, -0x50 on 32bit.
  -0x50 means 0x50 but doesn't allocate a stack pointer, saving a
  register and one instruction faster on function entry (for stack
  ptr loading) and one faster on exit (for stack ptr restore).  On
  next merge (m27), bring in this behavior to Chrome.  For now, we're
  not sure if Chrome ffmpeg currently understands -0x50, so the interim
  patch in Chrome ffmpeg uses (+)0x50 for 32bit.
<upstream in progress> - Win64 AVX alignment fix in x86inc.asm's
  WIN64_RESTORE_XMM_INTERNAL.
  TODO(wolenetz): Confirm upstream has the fix in M27 roll.
  TODO(rbultje): Fix may already be in ffmpeg HEAD, though code is
  significantly different versus current Chromium ffmpeg. This fix
  is needed prior to m27 merge so patched directly in Chromium's ffmpeg.

Current patches:

to_upstream/

ugly/
01_enable_checked_bitstream.patch
  dalecurtis: Removes "#define UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER 1" from all codecs
  defining it. In Chromium, all codecs should use the safe bitstream reader.

02_compile_with_disabled_features.patch
  dalecurtis: Add CONFIG_* checks to compile out code which we don't use which
  might be a security risk.  Discuss with cevans before removing.  Upstream does
  not want this patch.
  wolenetz: In M27 merge, added call to matroska_read_close(s) in to this patch
  in matroska_read_header() to mitigate memory leak caught by valgrind.
  Confirmed with rbultje that this conforms to API (on error in
  matroska_read_header(), resulting state should be same as prior to call; and
  no double-free is expected to result from this either.)

07_remove_av_gettime_symlink.patch
  dalecurtis: In order to preserve ABI compatibility after av_gettime() was
  moved inside the FFmpeg code base, they added a "symbolic link" version which
  our build chain doesn't like.  Remove it until the next major version bump.
  (If FF_SYMVER is no longer present, this ugly patch can be removed.)

compile_with_no_iconv.patch
  wolenetz: When CONFIG_ICONV is 0, the original code path did not return a
  value, causing compile failure on Windows.  It also aborted via an assert.
  This patch enables compiling by returning an appropriate error code and also
  removes the assert and abort.
