  http://crbug.com/112673

02_compile_with_disabled_features.patch
  dalecurtis: Add CONFIG_* checks to compile out code which we don't use which
  might be a security risk.  Discuss with cevans before removing.

03_ogg_seek_to_zero.patch
  dalecurtis: Seeking to zero works now, but frame timestamps don't line up.  A
  reproducible test case has been sent upstream.  Hopefully remove with M21.
