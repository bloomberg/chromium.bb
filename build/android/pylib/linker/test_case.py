"""Base class for linker-specific test cases.

   The custom dynamic linker can only be tested through a custom test case
   for various technical reasons:

     - It's an 'invisible feature', i.e. it doesn't expose a new API or
       behaviour, all it does is save RAM when loading native libraries.

     - Checking that it works correctly requires several things that do not
       fit the existing GTest-based and instrumentation-based tests:

         - Native test code needs to be run in both the browser and renderer
           process at the same time just after loading native libraries, in
           a completely asynchronous way.

         - Each test case requires restarting a whole new application process
           with a different command-line.

         - Enabling test support in the Linker code requires building a special
           APK with a flag to activate special test-only support code in the
           Linker code itself.

       Host-driven tests have also been tried, but since they're really
       sub-classes of instrumentation tests, they didn't work well either.

   To build and run the linker tests, do the following:

     ninja -C out/Debug chromium_linker_test_apk
     build/android/test_runner.py linker

            RENDERER_LINKER_TEST: <status>

        Note that there can be other lines beginning with BROWSER_LINKER_TEST:
        and RENDERER_LINKER_TEST:, but are not followed by a <status> code.

      - The test case passes if the <status> for both the browser and renderer
