Overview

    This extensions defines a way of importing into GL texture image data
    produced externally to GL via Chromium's SharedImage system.

New Procedures and Functions

    GLuint glCreateAndTexStorage2DSharedImageCHROMIUM (GLenum internal_format,
                                                       const GLbyte *mailbox)
    
    This function takes two arguments:
    internal_format - Must match the internal format of the SharedImage at
      creation time, with the exception that a caller may pass GL_RGB or
      GL_RGBA for a SharedImage created as RGBA_8888.

    mailbox - the mailbox referring to the SharedImage to assign to the
      first level of the mailbox.

    Logically, this function does three things:
    1) Creates a texture name and returns it to the caller.
    2) Creates a texture object for the name.
    3) Assigns the SharedImage represented by mailbox to the first level of
       the texture object.

    Note that the texutre created by this function is immutable.

    On success, this function extends the lifetime of the SharedImage
    referenced by mailbox by taking a ref. The texture object is deleted and
    the ref released once the calling context delete the texture name
    associated with the texture object, and detaches it from all framebuffer
    objects as well as texture unit bindings.

    Does not alter the texture bindings or alter the currently
    bound texture in any way.

    INVALID_OPERATION is generated if <mailbox> is not associated with a
    texture object. In this case the new texture name remains unbound.  It is
    treated in the same way as a new texture name returned by GenTextures.
