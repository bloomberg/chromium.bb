Dependencies

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required.

    CHROMIUM_flipy affects the definition of this extension.
    EXT_texture_format_BGRA8888 affects the definition of this extension.

Overview

    This extension expands on the functionality provided by the
    glCopyTexImage2D command.  A new function is exported,
    glCopyTextureCHROMIUM, that performs the same copy operation as
    glCopyTexImage2D, while respecting the pixel-storage modifiers
    UNPACK_FLIP_Y_CHROMIUM and GL_UNPACK_PREMULTIPLY_ALPHA_CHROMIUM.

    The extension also supports copying BGRA textures, which is not explicitly
    granted by EXT_texture_format_BGRA8888.

New Procedures and Functions

    void glCopyTextureCHROMIUM (GLenum target, GLenum source_id,
                                GLenum dest_id, GLint level,
                                GLint internal_format)

    Copies the contents of texture referred to by <source_id> to texture
    <dest_id>.

    Texture level 0 is copied from the source image to level <level> of the
    destination texture.

    The internal format of the destination texture is converted to that
    specified by <internal_format>

    <target> uses the same parameters as TexImage2D.

    INVALID_VALUE is generated if <target> is not GL_TEXTURE_2D.

    INVALID_VALUE is generated if <source_id> or <dest_id> are not valid texture
    objects.

    INVALID_VALUE is generated if textures corresponding to <source_id> and
    <dest_id> have not been bound as GL_TEXTURE_2D objects.

    INVALID_VALUE is generated if <level> is not a valid level of the
    destination texture, or if level 0 of the source texture is not defined.
