    OpenGL ES Extension #???

Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL ES 2.0 Specification.
    This extension depends on EXT_texture_storage.

Overview

    This allows clients to specify alternative texture backings which support
    scanout and can be used as hardware overlays.

New Tokens

    Accepted by the <bufferusage> parameter of glTexStorage2DImageCHROMIUM:
    GL_SCANOUT_CHROMIUM 0x6000

New Procedures and Functions

    The command

        void TexStorage2DImageCHROMIUM(enum target, enum internalformat,
                                       enum bufferusage, sizei width,
                                       sizei height);

    specifies that the (single) level of the texture is backed by a platform
    image buffer with the specified usage. The only supported buffer usage is
    SCANOUT_CHROMIUM which allows the texture to be used for scanout and in
    hardware overlays. The supported internal formats are RGBA8_OES,
    BGRA8_EXT, RGBAF16_EXT, and R8_EXT.

Errors

    A context lost will result when this call fails, either because of an
    invalid parameter value or because of a runtime error such as an out of
    memory condition.
