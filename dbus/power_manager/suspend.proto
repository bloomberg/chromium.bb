//
// The general flow is as follows:
//
// 1. A client that needs to perform some work before the system can be
//    suspended listens for SuspendImminent and SuspendDone signals from powerd.
// 2. The client passes a RegisterSuspendDelayRequest to powerd's
//    RegisterSuspendDelay method and receives a RegisterSuspendDelayReply in
//    response.  The client saves the |delay_id| field from the response.
// 3. When the power manager is about to suspend the system, it emits a
//    SuspendImminent signal containing this message.
// 4. Upon receipt of the signal, the client performs any last minute work
//    that it needs to do and then calls powerd's HandleSuspendReadiness method,
//    including its |delay_id| and the |suspend_id| field from the signal.
// 5. Once powerd has received notification that all registered clients are
//    ready to suspend, the system will be suspended.
// 6. After the system resumes (or the suspend attempt fails or is canceled),
//    powerd emits a SuspendDone signal. The client may undo any pre-suspend
//    work that was done in response to the SuspendImminent signal.
// 7. Before the client exits, it calls UnregisterSuspendDelayRequest with its
//    delay ID.
