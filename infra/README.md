# chromite/infra

This folder houses chromite-specific infra repos.
The subfolders are separate infra repos, not a part of chromite directly.
When adding a new infra repo, make sure to also add the folder to infra/.gitignore.


## proto

This folder contains the proto files for the Chromite Build API. See chromite/api for more information.
