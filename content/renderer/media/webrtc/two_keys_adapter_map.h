// A map with up to two keys per entry. An element is inserted with a key, this
// is the primary key. A secondary key can optionally be set to the same entry
// and it may be set at a later point in time than the element was inserted. For
// lookup and erasure both keys can be used.
//
// This was designed to assist the implementation of adapter maps. The adapters
// are the glue between the blink and webrtc layer objects. The adapter maps
// keep track of which blink and webrtc layer objects have which associated
// adapter. This requires two keys per adapter entry: something that can be used
// for lookup based on a webrtc layer object and something that can be used for
// lookup based on a blink layer object. The primary key is based on the
// webrtc/blink object that was used to create the adapter and the secondary key
// is based on the resulting blink/webrtc object after the adapter has been
// initialized.
