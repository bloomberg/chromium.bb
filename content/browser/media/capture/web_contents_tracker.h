// Given a starting render_process_id and main_render_frame_id, the
// WebContentsTracker tracks changes to the active RenderFrameHost tree during
// the lifetime of a WebContents instance. This is used to maintain capture of
// the WebContents's video and audio across page transitions such as user
// navigations, crashes, iframes, etc..
//
// Threading issues: Start(), Stop() and the ChangeCallback must be invoked on
// the same thread. This can be any thread, and the decision is locked-in once
// WebContentsTracker::Start() is called.
