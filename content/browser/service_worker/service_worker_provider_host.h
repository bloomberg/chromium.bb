// ServiceWorkerProviderHost is the browser-process representation of a
// renderer-process entity that can involve service workers. Currently, these
// entities are frames or workers. So basically, one ServiceWorkerProviderHost
// instance is the browser process's source of truth about one frame/worker in a
// renderer process, which the browser process uses when performing operations
// involving service workers.
//
// ServiceWorkerProviderHost lives on the IO thread, since all nearly all
// browser process service worker machinery lives on the IO thread.
//
// Example:
// * A new service worker registration is created. The browser process loops
// over all ServiceWorkerProviderHosts to find clients (frames and shared
// workers) with a URL inside the registration's scope, and has the provider
// host watch the registration in order to resolve navigator.serviceWorker.ready
// once the registration settles, if neeed.
//
// "Provider" is a somewhat tricky term. The idea is that a provider is what
// attaches to a frame/worker and "provides" it with functionality related to
// service workers. This functionality is mostly granted by creating the
// ServiceWorkerProviderHost for this frame/worker, which, again, makes the
// frame/worker alive in the browser's service worker world.
//
// The analogue of ServiceWorkerProviderHost ("provider host") on the renderer
// process is ServiceWorkerProviderContext ("provider"). A provider host has a
// Mojo connection to the provider in the renderer. Destruction of the host
// happens upon disconnection of the Mojo pipe.
//
// There are two general types of providers:
// 1) those for service worker clients (windows or shared workers), and
// 2) those for service workers themselves.
//
// For client providers, there is a provider per frame or shared worker in the
// renderer process. The lifetime of this host object is tied to the lifetime of
// the document or the worker.
//
// For service worker providers, there is a provider per running service worker
// in the renderer process. The lifetime of this host object is tied to the
// lifetime of the running service worker.
//
// A ServiceWorkerProviderHost is created in the following situations:
//
// 1) For a client created for a navigation (for both top-level and
// non-top-level frames), the provider host for the resulting document is
// pre-created by the browser process. Upon navigation commit, the provider is
// created on the renderer, which sends an OnProviderCreated IPC to establish
// the Mojo connection.
//
// 2) For clients created by the renderer not due to navigations (shared workers
// in the non-S13nServiceWorker case, and about:blank iframes), the provider
// host is created and the Mojo connection is established when the provider is
// created by the renderer process and sends an OnProviderCreated IPC.
//
// 3) For shared workers in the S13nServiceWorker case and for service workers,
// the provider host is pre-created by the browser process, and information
// about the host is sent in the start worker IPC message. The Mojo connection
// is established when renderer process receives the start message and creates
// the provider.
