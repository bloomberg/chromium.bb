// A ResourceHandler that prevents the renderer process from receiving network
// responses that contain cross-site documents (HTML, XML, some plain text) or
// similar data that should be opaque (JSON), with appropriate exceptions to
// preserve compatibility.  Other cross-site resources such as scripts, images,
// stylesheets, etc are still allowed.
//
// This handler is not used for navigations, which create a new security context
// based on the origin of the response.  It currently only protects documents
// from sites that require dedicated renderer processes, though it could be
// expanded to apply to all sites.
//
// When a response is blocked, the renderer is sent an empty response body
// instead of seeing a failed request.  A failed request would change page-
// visible behavior (e.g., for a blocked XHR).  An empty response can generally
// be consumed by the renderer without noticing the difference.
