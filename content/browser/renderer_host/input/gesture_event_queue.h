// Maintains WebGestureEvents in a queue before forwarding them to the renderer
// to apply a sequence of filters on them:
// 1. The sequence is filtered for bounces. A bounce is when the finger lifts
//    from the screen briefly during an in-progress scroll. Ifco this happens,
//    non-GestureScrollUpdate events are queued until the de-bounce interval
//    passes or another GestureScrollUpdate event occurs.
// 2. Unnecessary GestureFlingCancel events are filtered by fling controller.
//    These are GestureFlingCancels that have no corresponding GestureFlingStart
//    in the queue.
// 3. Taps immediately after a GestureFlingCancel (caused by the same tap) are
//    filtered by fling controller.
// 4. Whenever possible, events in the queue are coalesced to have as few events
//    as possible and therefore maximize the chance that the event stream can be
//    handled entirely by the compositor thread.
// Events in the queue are forwarded to the renderer one by one; i.e., each
// event is sent after receiving the ACK for previous one. The only exception is
// that if a GestureScrollUpdate is followed by a GesturePinchUpdate, they are
// sent together.
// TODO(rjkroege): Possibly refactor into a filter chain:
// http://crbug.com/148443.
