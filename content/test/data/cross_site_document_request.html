<p>This test does cross-site XHR fetches of documents with the Same Origin
Policy turned off in the renderer. The Same Origin Policy can be circumvented
when the renderer is compromised, but site isolation ought to block cross-site
documents at the IPC layer.</p>

<p>We only block cross-site documents with a blacklisted mime type (text/html,
text/xml, application/json), that are correctly sniffed as the content type that
they claim to be. We also block text/plain documents when their body looks like
one of the blacklisted content types.</p>

  xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
    if (xhr.readyState == 4) {
      // At one point this test operated with an experimental flag to actually
      // block requests in the render process -- in that case the blocked
      // response was replaced with the literal string " ". That flag has been
      // removed (circa June 2015), but when browser process document blocking
      // is implemented, we may wish to update this test accordingly.
      var wasBlocked = xhr.responseText == " ";
