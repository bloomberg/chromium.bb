// ServiceWorkerNetworkProvider, and ServiceWorkerContextClient). Providers for
// the same underlying entity hold strong references to a shared instance of
// this class.
//
// The ServiceWorkerProviderContext has different roles depending on if it's for
// a "controllee" (a Document or Worker execution context), or a "controller" (a
// service worker execution context).
//  - For controllees, it's used for keeping the controller alive to create
//    controllee's ServiceWorkerContainer#controller. The reference to the
//    controller is kept until SetController() is called with an
//    invalid worker info.
//  - For controllers, it's used for keeping the associated registration and
//    its versions alive to create the controller's
//    ServiceWorkerGlobalScope#registration.
//
// Created and destructed on the main thread. Unless otherwise noted, all
// methods are called on the main thread.
