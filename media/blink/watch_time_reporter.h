namespace media {

// Class for monitoring and reporting watch time in response to various state
// changes during the playback of media. We record metrics for audio only
// playbacks as well as video only or audio+video playbacks of sufficient size.
//
// Watch time for our purposes is defined as the amount of elapsed media time.
// Any amount of elapsed time is reported to the WatchTimeRecorder, but only
// amounts above limits::kMinimumElapsedWatchTimeSecs are reported to UMA. Watch
// time is checked every 5 seconds from then on and reported to multiple
// buckets: All, MSE, SRC, EME, AC, and battery.
//
// Either of paused or muted is sufficient to stop watch time metric reports.
// Each of these has a hysteresis where if the state change is undone within 5
// seconds, the watch time will be counted as uninterrupted.
//
// There are both foreground and background buckets for watch time. E.g., when
// media goes into the background foreground collection stops and background
// collection starts. As with other events, there is hysteresis on change
// between the foreground and background.
//
// Power events (on/off battery power), native controls changes, or display type
// changes have a similar hysteresis, but unlike the aforementioned properties,
// will not stop metric collection.
//
// Each seek event will result in a new watch time metric being started and the
// old metric finalized as accurately as possible.
