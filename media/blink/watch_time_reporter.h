// Class for monitoring and reporting watch time in response to various state
// changes during the playback of media. We record metrics for audio only
// playbacks as well as audio+video playbacks of sufficient size.
//
// Watch time for our purposes is defined as the amount of elapsed media time
// for audio only or audio+video media. A minimum of 7 seconds of unmuted media
// must be watched to start watch time monitoring. Watch time is checked every 5
// seconds from then on and reported to multiple buckets: All, MSE, SRC, EME,
// AC, and battery.
//
// Any one of paused, hidden (where this is video), or muted is sufficient to
// stop watch time metric reports. Each of these has a hysteresis where if the
// state change is undone within 5 seconds, the watch time will be counted as
// uninterrupted.
//
// If the media is audio+video, foreground watch time is logged to the normal
// AudioVideo bucket, while background watch time goes to the specific
// AudioVideo.Background bucket. As with other events, there is hysteresis on
// change between the foreground and background.
//
// Power events (on/off battery power) have a similar hysteresis, but unlike
// the aforementioned properties, will not stop metric collection.
//
// Each seek event will result in a new watch time metric being started and the
// old metric finalized as accurately as possible.
