//    called, Write() before Open() finishes or Open() after Open()), kError

// 2, When the file is opened by another CDM instance, or when we call Read()/
//    Write() during a pending Read()/Write(), kInUse will be returned. The
//    state of |this| will not change.
// 3, When a pepper operation failed (either synchronously or asynchronously),
//    kError will be returned. The state of |this| will be set to ERROR.
// 4. Any operation in ERROR state will end up with kError.
