    // Sources of VideoFrames use this marker to indicate that the associated
    // VideoFrame can be overlayed, case in which its contents do not need to be
    // further composited but displayed directly. Use Get/SetBoolean() for
    // this Key.
    ALLOW_OVERLAY,

    // Video capture begin/end timestamps.  Consumers can use these values for
    // dynamic optimizations, logging stats, etc.  Use Get/SetTimeTicks() for
    // these keys.
    CAPTURE_BEGIN_TIME,
    CAPTURE_END_TIME,

    // A counter that is increased by the producer of video frames each time
    // it pushes out a new frame. By looking for gaps in this counter, clients
    // can determine whether or not any frames have been dropped on the way from
    // the producer between two consecutively received frames. Note that the
    // counter may start at arbitrary values, so the absolute value of it has no
    // meaning.
    CAPTURE_COUNTER,

    // A base::ListValue containing 4 integers representing x, y, width, height
    // of the rectangular region of the frame that has changed since the frame
    // with the directly preceding CAPTURE_COUNTER. If that frame was not
    // received, typically because it was dropped during transport from the
    // producer, clients must assume that the entire frame has changed.
    // The rectangle is relative to the full frame data, i.e. [0, 0,
    // coded_size().width(), coded_size().height()]. It does not have to be
    // fully contained within visible_rect().
    CAPTURE_UPDATE_RECT,

    // Indicates that this frame must be copied to a new texture before use,
    // rather than being used directly. Specifically this is required for
    // WebView because of limitations about sharing surface textures between GL
    // contexts.
    COPY_REQUIRED,

    // Indicates if the current frame is the End of its current Stream. Use
    // Get/SetBoolean() for this Key.
    END_OF_STREAM,

    // The estimated duration of this frame (i.e., the amount of time between
    // the media timestamp of this frame and the next).  Note that this is not
    // the same information provided by FRAME_RATE as the FRAME_DURATION can
    // vary unpredictably for every frame.  Consumers can use this to optimize
    // playback scheduling, make encoding quality decisions, and/or compute
    // frame-level resource utilization stats.  Use Get/SetTimeDelta() for this
    // key.
    FRAME_DURATION,

    // Represents either the fixed frame rate, or the maximum frame rate to
    // expect from a variable-rate source.  This value generally remains the
    // same for all frames in the same session.  Use Get/SetDouble() for this
    // key.
    FRAME_RATE,

    // This is a boolean that signals that the video capture engine detects
    // interactive content. One possible optimization that this signal can help
    // with is remote content: adjusting end-to-end latency down to help the
    // user better coordinate their actions.
    //
    // Use Get/SetBoolean for this key.
    INTERACTIVE_CONTENT,

    // This field represents the local time at which either: 1) the frame was
    // generated, if it was done so locally; or 2) the targeted play-out time
    // of the frame, if it was generated from a remote source. This value is NOT
    // a high-resolution timestamp, and so it should not be used as a
    // presentation time; but, instead, it should be used for buffering playback
    // and for A/V synchronization purposes.
    // Use Get/SetTimeTicks() for this key.
    REFERENCE_TIME,

    // A feedback signal that indicates the fraction of the tolerable maximum
    // amount of resources that were utilized to process this frame.  A producer
    // can check this value after-the-fact, usually via a VideoFrame destruction
    // observer, to determine whether the consumer can handle more or less data
    // volume, and achieve the right quality versus performance trade-off.
    //
    // Use Get/SetDouble() for this key.  Values are interpreted as follows:
    // Less than 0.0 is meaningless and should be ignored.  1.0 indicates a
    // maximum sustainable utilization.  Greater than 1.0 indicates the consumer
    // is likely to stall or drop frames if the data volume is not reduced.
    //
    // Example: In a system that encodes and transmits video frames over the
    // network, this value can be used to indicate whether sufficient CPU
    // is available for encoding and/or sufficient bandwidth is available for
    // transmission over the network.  The maximum of the two utilization
    // measurements would be used as feedback.
    RESOURCE_UTILIZATION,

    // Sources of VideoFrames use this marker to indicate that an instance of
    // VideoFrameExternalResources produced from the associated video frame
    // should use read lock fences.
    READ_LOCK_FENCES_ENABLED,

    // Indicates that the frame is rotated.
    ROTATION,

    // Android only: if set, then this frame is not suitable for overlay, even
    // if ALLOW_OVERLAY is set.  However, it allows us to process the overlay
    // to see if it would have been promoted, if it were backed by a SurfaceView
    // instead.  This lets us figure out when SurfaceViews are appropriate.
    TEXTURE_OWNER,

    // Android only: if set, then this frame's resource would like to be
    // notified about its promotability to an overlay.
    WANTS_PROMOTION_HINT,

    // This video frame comes from protected content.
    PROTECTED_VIDEO,

    // This video frame is protected by hardware. This option is valid only if
    // PROTECTED_VIDEO is also set to true.
    HW_PROTECTED,

    // An UnguessableToken that identifies VideoOverlayFactory that created
    // this VideoFrame. It's used by Cast to help with video hole punch.
    // Use Get/SetUnguessableToken() for this key.
    OVERLAY_PLANE_ID,

    // Whether this frame was decoded in a power efficient way.
    POWER_EFFICIENT,

    // CompositorFrameMetadata variables associated with this frame. Used for
    // remote debugging.
    // Use Get/SetDouble() for these keys.
    // TODO(crbug.com/832220): Use a customized dictionary value instead of
    // using these keys directly.
