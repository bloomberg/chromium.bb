This script parses the /verbose output from the VC++ linker and uses it to
explain why a particular object file is being linked in. It parses records
like these:

      Found "public: static void * __cdecl SkTLS::Get(void * (__cdecl*)(void)...
        Referenced in chrome_crash_reporter_client_win.obj
        Referenced in skia.lib(SkError.obj)
        Loaded skia.lib(SkTLS.obj)

and then uses the information to answer questions such as "why is SkTLS.obj
being linked in. In this case it was requested by SkError.obj, and the process
is then repeated for SkError.obj. It traces the dependency tree back to a file
that was specified on the command line. Typically that file is part of a
source_set, and if that source_set is causing unnecessary code and data to be
pulled in then changing it to a static_library may reduce the binary size. See
crrev.com/2556603002 for an example of a ~900 KB savings from such a change.

In other cases the source_set to static_library fix does not work because some
of the symbols are required, while others are pulling in unwanted object files.
In these cases it can be necessary to see what symbol is causing one object file
to reference another. Removing or moving the problematic symbol can fix the
problem. See crrev.com/2559063002 for an example of such a change.

One complication is that there are sometimes multiple source files with the
same name, such as crc.c, which can make analysis more difficult or
ambiguous. If this becomes a blocking issue they it may be necessary to
temporarily rename the source file.

Object file name matching is case sensitive.

Typical output when run on chrome.dll verbose link output is:

>python tools\win\linker_verbose_tracking.py chrome_verbose_02.txt flac_crc
Database loaded - 11277 xrefs found
flac_crc.obj pulled in for symbol "_FLAC__crc8" by
        stream_decoder.obj
        bitwriter.obj

stream_decoder.obj pulled in for symbol "_FLAC__stream_decoder_new" by
        stream_encoder.obj
bitwriter.obj pulled in for symbol "_FLAC__bitwriter_new" by
        stream_encoder.obj

stream_encoder.obj pulled in for symbol "_FLAC__stream_encoder_new" by
        Command-line obj file: audio_encoder.obj
