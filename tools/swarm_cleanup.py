  Remove the directory located at *path, if it exists.

  shutil.rmtree() doesn't work on Windows if any of the files or directories
  are read-only, which svn repositories and some .svn files are.  We need to
  be able to force the files to be writable (i.e., deletable) as we traverse
  the tree.

  Even with all this, Windows still sometimes fails to delete a file, citing
  a permission error (maybe something to do with antivirus scans or disk
  indexing).  The best suggestion any of the user forums had was to wait a
  bit and try again, so we do that too.  It's hand-waving, but sometimes it
  works. :/
