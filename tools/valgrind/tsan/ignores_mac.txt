# This file lists the functions, object files and source files
# which should be ignored (i.e. not instrumented) by ThreadSanitizer on Mac OS.
# At the moment the Chromium binaries' debug info is not available to
# ThreadSanitizer, so we have to define fun:* rules for Mac OS complementing
# the src:* rules defined for Linux.

# we ignore the Security libraries for now since
# their instrumentation is very slow.
# TODO(timurrrr): investigate whether we need to instrument them
obj:*/Security*
obj:*/libcrypto*
# SensitiveAllocator::free is a part of the Security framework.
# It calls bzero (0xffff0633) which can't be resolved and thus should be
# ignored recursively.

# The CFBag and CFDictionary operators should be thread-safe, but they are not
# annotated properly.
# TODO(glider): replace all the CoreFoundation suppressions with ignores.
