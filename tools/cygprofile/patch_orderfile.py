"""Patch an orderfile.

Starting with a list of symbols in a binary and an orderfile (ordered list of
sections), matches the symbols in the orderfile and augments each symbol with
the symbols residing at the same address (due to having identical code).  The
output is a list of section or symbols matching rules appropriate for the linker
option -section-ordering-file for gold and --symbol-ordering-file for lld. Both
linkers are fine with extra directives that aren't matched in the binary, so we
construct a file suitable for both, concatenating sections and symbols. We
assume that the unpatched orderfile is built for gold, that is, it only contains
sections.

Note: It is possible to have.
- Several symbols mapping to the same offset in the binary.
- Several offsets for a given symbol (because we strip the ".clone." and other
  suffixes)

The general pipeline is:
1. Get the symbol infos (name, offset, size, section) from the binary
2. Get the symbol names from the orderfile
3. Find the orderfile symbol names in the symbols coming from the binary
4. For each symbol found, get all the symbols at the same address
5. Output them to an updated orderfile suitable for gold and lld
6. Output catch-all section matching rules for unprofiled methods. This is
   ineffective for lld, as it doesn't handle wildcards, but puts unordered
   symbols after the ordered ones.
