This file is used to generate a comprehensive list of Chrome histograms along
with a detailed description for each histogram.

Please pretty-print and validate your edits by running the pretty_print.py
and validate_format.py scripts in the same directory as this file before
uploading your change for review.

Take a moment to page through the contents of this file. You will find
three sections:

* The histograms section describes base histograms, giving their name,
  and optionally their units or enum type, a short one-line summary,
  and optionally a more detailed description.
* The enums section defines and documents the enumerated types referred to by
  the histograms.
* The histogram_suffixes section provides a compact way of defining histograms
  by applying affixes to existing histograms. This could be done recursively
  and the max recursion depth is 5. See the example below for details on how it
  works.

Each histogram_suffixes tag lists the histograms that it affects. The complete
list of histograms is computed by appending (or prepending - see below) the
histogram_suffixes suffix names to each of the affected histograms. For example,
define the following:

  <histogram name="FileLoadLatency"/>

  <histogram_suffixes name="SuperHttpExperiment">
    <suffix name="SuperHttpEnabled"/>
    <suffix name="SuperHttpDisabled"/>
    <affected-histogram name="FileLoadLatency"/>
  </histogram_suffixes>

The complete list of histograms will be:

  FileLoadLatency
  FileLoadLatency_SuperHttpEnabled
  FileLoadLatency_SuperHttpDisabled

histogram_suffixes can also be used to insert affix in the middle. Example:

  <histogram name="Prerender.Events"/>

  <histogram_suffixes name="SuperHttpExperiment" ordering="prefix">
    <suffix name="HoverStats50"/>
    <affected-histogram name="Prerender.Events"/>
  </histogram_suffixes>

The complete list of histograms will be:

  Prerender.Events
  Prerender.HoverStats50_Events

When 'ordering="prefix"' is present in the histogram_suffixes tag, the suffix
will be inserted after the first dot separator of the affected-histogram name.
Therefore, the affected-histogram name has to have at least one dot in it.

    start means that it was.  Warm starts can happen when the user closes
    multiple tabs close together.  When the undo bar is dismissed, all closes
    that were queued up to be undone are committed.  This can happen either by a
    timeout or by an action by the user to move to another part of the UI.

    In some cases, such as when content arrives with embedded references to

    with references to about 12 additional hostnames, none of which might be

    anticipated (since scanning in not allowed by default). Such resolutions are
    termed &quot;Unexpected Resolutions,&quot; and the durations associated with
    those navigation induced DNS resolutions are shown below.  If a referring
    URL is available for the navigation, the relationship to the referring URL
    was recorded, and future navigations to the referring hostname would have
    induced a pre-resolution of hostname that caused an entry below.  Such any

  <summary>
    The number of glyph pages present in the renderer when it commits a load.
    Since this is per-sub-process, you can get the average number of glyph pages
    in the system by multiplying this number with the average number of
    renderers. Note that this typically won't count the glyph pages added as a
    result of the load that just committed, since layout will happen after the
    commit. There are 512 bytes per glyph page, but this number also very
    closely approximates the number of glyph width map pages in the same
    renderer. The only difference is that if you have font fallback, it will
    make a new glyph page and no width page, but in most common cases there is
    no fallback). Width pages are 1K each (256 floats), so you could think of
    this value as being the number of &quot;1.5K units related to glyphs per
    renderer per page load&quot;.

  <details>
    Currently, the most common (only?) motivations are SELF_REFERAL,
    LEARNED_REFERAL and OMNIBOX. The SELF_REFERAL indicates that we made sure a
    second connection was available for a resource that either was never before
    seen, or has historically had no subresources.  The LEARNED_REFERAL
    indicates that we &quot;learned&quot; that a subresource was commonly
    needed, and that motivated the TCP/IP preconnect. The OMNIBOX motivation
    happens when a search is being suggested, and we preconnect to the search

<histogram name="Omnibox.UserTextCleared" enum="OmniboxUserTextCleared">

  <summary>
    Counts the number of times that the user text is cleared.  IME users are
    sometimes in the situation that IME was unintentionally turned on and failed
    to input latin alphabets (ASCII characters) or the opposite case.  In that
    case, users may delete all the text and the user text gets cleared.  This
    histogram helps us estimate how often this scenario happens.

    Note that since we don't currently correlate &quot;text cleared&quot; events
    with IME usage, this also captures many other cases where users clear the
    text; though it explicitly doesn't log deleting all the permanent text as
    the first action of an editing sequence (see comments in

  <owner>Please list the metric's owners. Add more owner tags as needed.</owner>
  <summary>
    Retries needed to enable a FET on tps65090 (AKA tpschrome).  Tps65090 is a
    power management unit (PMU) used on many ARM Chromebooks.  Until version ES7
    was rolled into production we would sometimes run into a problem where FET1
    (the FET used to switch on and off the backlight) wouldn't turn on properly.
    This problem was especially prevalent when the voltage was high (like when
    the device was plugged into the wall).  Retrying by turning the FET off and
    on again is nearly always effective, so the kernel will retry up to 5 times
    (currently) and will also log the fact that it needed to retry.  On newest
    kernels (kernel 3.8 and up) a kernel warning will be logged with WARN_ON if
    the FET still failed to turn on after 5 tries. Refer to the kernel warning
    reports to find that information.  For more details about this bug refer to
    http://crbug.com/338657 and http://crosbug.com/p/16009.  Note that we log
    retries on all 7 FETs even though we've only ever seen failures of FET1.

  <summary>
    Count of how many instances of WebCore::Page use various features. Each

    reports feature usage (e.g. via UseCounter::count() method).
  </summary>

<histogram name="WebCore.FeatureObserver.CSSProperties"
    enum="MappedCSSProperties">
  <owner>eseidel@chromium.org</owner>
  <owner>mikelawther@chromium.org</owner>
  <summary>
    Records usage of CSS properties used on a page, either statically or
    dynamically, from the time the page is initialised to when it is closed or
    navigated away from. Each property is counted at most once per page per
    view.
  </summary>
  <details>
    Every time a CSS property is parsed on a page, that property is recorded as
    having been used. The histogram is updated with this data whenever a page is
    closed, or a page navigation happens. Each histogram bucket corresponds to a
    CSS property (eg width, border-radius). The exception is the bucket numbered
    '1' - this counts the number of pages that CSS properties were counted on.

    These numbers give the percentage of pages that use a CSS property. For
    example, if the 'border-radius' histogram bucket has a count of 250, and the
    page count bucket (i.e. bucket number 1) has a count of 1000 - this means
    that 1000 pages were recorded, and border-radius was used on 25% of those
    pages.

    Internally, each WebCore::Page has a WebCore::UseCounter instance, with
    booleans recording use of each CSS property - one boolean per property. Upon
    destruction of the WebCore::Page (e.g. by the user closing the tab), or a
    page navigation happening, the histogram is updated. For each boolean that
    is set to True, the corresponding histogram bucket for that CSS property is
    incremented by 1. The page count bucket (i.e. bucket number 1) is always
    incremented by 1 on each histogram update.

    font data or not. (A Font can be used without being styled, for example when
    drawn by a Canvas 2D Context.) This is recorded upon a download request of a

    Deprecated as of 8/2013. This histogram only considered the leaf certificate
    expiry date as a proxy for whether a certificate was in-scope for the BRs,
    but did not consider the issuance date. As some CAs have issued long-lived
    certs prior to the BRs, this disproportionately reported those certs as
    being subject to the BRs, but non-compliant, when in reality they're not
    subject.
