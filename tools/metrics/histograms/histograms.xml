This file is used to generate a comprehensive list of Chrome histograms along
with a detailed description for each histogram.

Please pretty-print and validate your edits by running the pretty_print.py
and validate_format.py scripts in the same directory as this file before
uploading your change for review.

Take a moment to page through the contents of this file. You will find
three sections:

* The histograms section describes base histograms, giving their name,
  and optionally their units or enum type, a short one-line summary,
  and optionally a more detailed description.
* The enums section defines and documents the enumerated types referred to by
  the histograms.
* The fieldtrials section defines active field trials and their groups, along
  with their descriptions.

Each field trial lists the histograms that it affects. The complete list of
histograms is computed by appending the field trial group names to each of
the affected histograms. For example, define the following:

  <histogram name="FileLoadLatency"/>

  <fieldtrial name="SuperHttpExperiment">
    <group name="SuperHttpEnabled">
    <group name="SuperHttpDisabled">
    <affected-histogram name="FileLoadLatency"/>
  </fieldtrial>

The complete list of histograms will be:

  FileLoadLatency
  FileLoadLatency_SuperHttpEnabled
  FileLoadLatency_SuperHttpDisabled

Field trial definitions can currently be used in any situation where multiple
suffixes need to be appended to a histogram name; they do not have to
correspond to actual field trials in the Chrome source code.

TODO(mlloyd): Refactor the XML so that field trials can be distinguished from
other types of suffix sets.

    Currently, the most common (only?) motivations are SELF_REFERAL,

    second connection was available for a resource that either was never before
    seen, or has historically had no subresources.  The LEARNED_REFERAL
    indicates that we &quot;learned&quot; that a subresource was commonly
    needed, and that motivated the TCP/IP preconnect. The OMNIBOX motivation
    happens when a search is being suggested, and we preconnect to the search
    provider. (WARNING: Prior to version 7.517.*, enums 7, 8, and 9 may be
