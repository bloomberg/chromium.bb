<p>
Use page actions to put icons inside the address bar.
Page actions represent actions
that can be taken on the current page,
but that aren't applicable to all pages.
Some examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Subscribe to this page's RSS feed </li>
  <li> Make a slideshow out of this page's photos </li>
</ul>

<p>
The RSS icon in the following screenshot
represents a page action
that lets you subscribe to
the RSS feed for the current page.
</p>

<img src="{{static}}/images/page-action.png"
  width="361" height="79" />

<p>
If you want the extension's icon to always be visible,
use a <a href="browserAction.html">browser action</a> instead.
</p>

<p class="caution">
<strong>Note:</strong>
Packaged apps cannot use page actions.
</p>


<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>
Register your page action in the
<a href="manifest.html">extension manifest</a>
like this:
</p>

<pre>{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  <b>"page_action": {
    "default_icon": "icons/foo.png", <em>// optional</em>
    "default_title": "Do action",    <em>// optional; shown in tooltip</em>
    "default_popup": "popup.html"    <em>// optional</em>
  }</b>,
  ...
}</pre>

<h2 id="ui">Parts of the UI</h2>

<p>
Like browser actions,
page actions can have an icon,
a tooltip, and popup;
they can't have badges, however.
In addition, page actions can appear and disappear.
You can find information about icons, tooltips, and popups
by reading about the
<a href="browserAction.html#ui">browser action UI</a>.
</p>

<p>
You make a page action appear and disappear using the
<a href="#method-show">show()</a> and
<a href="#method-hide">hide()</a> methods, respectively.
By default, a page action is hidden.
When you show it, you specify the tab
in which the icon should appear.
The icon remains visible
until the tab is closed
or starts displaying a different URL
(because the user clicks a link, for example).
</p>




<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<p>For the best visual impact,
follow these guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Do</b> use page actions
    for features that make sense
    for only a few pages.
  <li><b>Don't</b> use page actions
    for features that make sense
    for most pages.
    Use <a href="browserAction.html">browser actions</a> instead.
  <li><b>Don't</b> constantly animate your icon.
    That's just annoying.
</ul>
