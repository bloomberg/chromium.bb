<p>
Use the <code>chrome.declarativeWebRequest</code> module to intercept, block, or
modify requests in-flight. It is significantly faster than the <a
  href="webRequest.html"><code>chrome.webRequest</code> API</a> because you can
register rules that are evaluated in the browser rather than the
JavaScript engine which reduces roundtrip latencies and allows for very high
efficiency.
</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>
You must declare the "declarative" and the "declarativeWebRequest" permission in
the <a href="manifest.html">extension manifest</a> to use this API,
along with <a href="manifest.html#permissions">host permissions</a> for any
hosts whose network requests you want to access. 
</p>

<pre>{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
<b>  "permissions": [
    "declarative",
    "declarativeWebRequest",
    "*://*.google.com"
  ]</b>,
  ...
}</pre>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<p>
The Declarative Web Request API follows the concepts of the <a
  href="events.html#declarative">Declarative API</a>. You can register rules to
the <code>chrome.declarativeWebRequest.onRequest</code> event object.
</p>

<p>
The Declarative Web Request API supports a single type of match criteria, the
<code>RequestMatcher</code>. The <code>RequestMatcher</code> matches network
requests if and only if all listed criteria are met. The following
<code>RequestMatcher</code> would match a network request when the user enters
"http://www.example.com" in the URL bar:
</p>

<pre>
var matcher = new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
  url: { hostSuffix: 'example.com', schemes: ['http'] },
  resourceType: 'main_frame'
  });
</pre>

<p>
Requests to "https://www.example.com" would be rejected by the
<code>RequestMatcher</code> due to the scheme. Also all requests for an embedded
iframe would be rejected due to the <code>resourceType</code>.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> All conditions and actions are created via a constructor
as shown in the example above.
<p>

<p>
In order to cancel all requests to "example.com", you can define a rule as
follows:
</p>
<pre>
var rule = {
  conditions: [
    new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
      url: { hostSuffix: 'example.com' } })
  ],
  actions: [
    new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.CancelRequest()
  ]};
</pre>

<p>
In order to cancel all requests to "example.com" and "foobar.com", you can add a
second condition, as each condition is sufficient to trigger all specified
actions:
</p>
<pre>
var rule2 = {
  conditions: [
    new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
      url: { hostSuffix: 'example.com' } }),
    new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.RequestMatcher({
      url: { hostSuffix: 'foobar.com' } })
  ],
  actions: [
    new chrome.declarativeWebRequest.CancelRequest()
  ]};
</pre>

<p>
Register rules as follows:
</p>
<pre>
chrome.declarativeWebRequest.onRequest.addRules([rule2]);
</pre>

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> You should always register or unregister rules in bulk rather than
individually because each of these operations recreates internal data
structures.  This re-creation is computationally expensive but facilitates a
very fast URL matching algorithm for hundreds of thousands of URLs.
</p>

<h2 id="TODO">Todo</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Explain precedences, once we can ignore rules based on their priority
  (e.g. how can I cancel all requests except for a specific whitelist?)
  <li>Explain when conditions can be evaluated, when actions can be executed,
  and when rules can be executed (e.g. you cannot cancel a request when you
  have received the response already)
</ul>
