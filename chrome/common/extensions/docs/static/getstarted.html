This tutorial walks you through creating a simple extension.
You'll add a button to Google Chrome
that, when clicked, displays an automatically generated page.
The button and page will look something like this:
</p>

<img src="images/hello_world-page-small.gif"
  width="291" height="184"
  alt="a window with a grid of images related to HELLO WORLD" />

[PENDING: rewrite the example to use a browser action instead of a toolstrip]
</p>

<h2 id="browser">Get your browser ready</h2>

<p>To develop extensions for Google Chrome,
you need to <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel">subscribe
to the dev channel</a> of Google Chrome for Windows.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> This tutorial requires Windows.
You can try it on Linux and OS X, and it might work,
but the extensions support is less stable on those platforms.
We're working hard to bring them up to speed.
</p>

<h2 id="load">Create and load an extension</h2>
<p>
In this section, you'll write a <em>toolstrip</em> &mdash;
an extension
that puts a bit of UI into the <em>toolbar</em>
at the bottom of the Google Chrome window.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Create a folder somewhere on your computer to contain your extension's code.
    We'll assume the folder is located at
    <strong><code>c:\myext</code></strong>,
    but it can be anywhere.
  </li>
  <li>
    Inside your extension's folder,
    create a text file called <strong><code>manifest.json</code></strong>,
    and put this in it:
<pre>{
  &quot;name&quot;: &quot;My First Extension&quot;,
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0&quot;,
  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;The first extension that I made.&quot;,
  &quot;toolstrips&quot;: [
    &quot;my_toolstrip.html&quot;
  ],
  &quot;permissions&quot;: [
    &quot;http://api.flickr.com/&quot;
  ]
}</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    In the same folder, create a text file called
    <strong><code>my_toolstrip.html</code></strong>,
    and put this in it:
<pre>&lt;div class=&quot;toolstrip-button&quot;&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
  </li>
  <li> Load the extension.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
      Bring up the Extensions management page by going to this URL:
      <blockquote>
      <b>chrome://extensions</b>
      </blockquote>
      </li>

      <li>
      Click the <b>Load unpacked extension</b> button.
      A file dialog appears.
      </li>

      <li>
      In the file dialog,
      navigate to your extension's folder
      (<code>c:\myext</code>, for example)
      and click the <b>OK</b> button.
      </li>
    </ol> </li>
  </ol>

<p>
If your extension is valid,
information about it
appears in the <b>Installed extensions</b> part
of the Extensions page,
as the following screenshot shows.
</p>

<p>
<a href="images/load_after.gif"><img
  src="images/load_after-small.gif"
  width="327" height="196" /></a>
</p>

<p>
You should see the UI for your extension at the bottom left of the browser,
looking something like this:
</p>

<table class="imagelayout">
    <tbody>
      <tr class="images">
        <td width="33%"><img src="images/hw-1.gif"
                                        alt="" /></td>
        <td width="33%"><img src="images/hw-2.gif"
                                        alt="" /></td>
        <td width="33%"><img src="images/hw-3.gif"
                                        alt="" /></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td width="33%"> default appearance</td>
        <td width="33%"> initial onhover appearance</td>
        <td width="33%"> final onhover appearance</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

  <p>
  Your extension's button is automatically styled
  to look like it belongs in the browser.
  If you put the cursor over the button,
  the button gets a nice, rounded edge,
  just like the buttons in the bookmark bar.
  After a while, a tooltip comes up, identifying the extension.

  [PENDING: troubleshooting info should go here.
  what are symptoms of common typos, including misnamed files?
  what are the symptoms if you don't have the dev channel?]
  </p>

<h2 id="code">Add code to the extension</h2>
<p> In this step, you'll make your extension <em>do</em> something besides just look good. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p> Inside your extension's folder,
    create a text file called <strong><code>hello_world.html</code></strong>,
    and add the following code to it:</p>
    <blockquote> <a href="samples/hello_world.txt">CSS
    and JavaScript code for hello_world</a></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p> Edit <code>my_toolstrip.html</code>, so that it has the following code: </p>
    <pre>&lt;div class=&quot;toolstrip-button&quot;<b> onclick=&quot;window.open('hello_world.html')&quot;</b>&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Return to <b>chrome://extensions</b>,
    and click the <b>Reload</b> button
    to load the new version of the extension.</li>
  <li>Click the button.
  A window should come up that displays <code>hello_world.html</code>. </li>
</ol>
<p> It should look something like this:</p>

<img src="images/hello_world-page.gif"
  width="583" height="368"
  alt="a window with a grid of images related to HELLO WORLD" />

<p> If you don't see that page,
try the instructions again,
following them exactly.
Don't try loading an HTML file that isn't in the extension's folder &mdash;
it won't work! </p>
