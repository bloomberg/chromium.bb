This tutorial walks you through creating a simple extension.
You'll add an icon to Google Chrome
that, when clicked, displays an automatically generated page.
The icon and page will look something like this:
</p>

<img src="images/hello-world-small.png"
  width="300" height="221"
  alt="a window with a grid of images related to HELLO WORLD" />


<h2 id="browser">Get your browser ready</h2>

<p>To develop extensions for Google Chrome,
you need to <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel">subscribe
to the Dev or Beta channel</a> of Google Chrome for Windows. Extensions aren't yet available in the stable channel.
</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> This tutorial requires Windows.
You can try it on Linux and OS X, and it might work,
but the extensions support is less stable on those platforms.
We're working hard to bring them up to speed.
</p>

<h2 id="load">Create and load an extension</h2>
<p>
In this section, you'll write an extension
that adds a <em>browser action</em>
to the toolbar of Google Chrome.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Create a folder somewhere on your computer to contain your extension's code.
    We'll assume the folder is located at
    <strong><code>c:\myext</code></strong>,
    but it can be anywhere.
  </li>
  <li>
    Inside your extension's folder,
    create a text file called <strong><code>manifest.json</code></strong>,
    and put this in it:
<pre>{
  "name": "My First Extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "The first extension that I made.",
  "browser_action": {
    "default_icon": "icon.png"
  },
  "permissions": [
    "http://api.flickr.com/"
  ]
}</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
    Copy this icon to the same folder:<br>
    <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border:0">
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align:center; border:0;"><a
          href="examples/tutorials/getstarted/icon.png"
            ><img src="examples/tutorials/getstarted/icon.png"
              width="19" height="19" border="0"></a><br>
          <a href="examples/tutorials/getstarted/icon.png"
            >Download icon.png</a></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li id="load-ext"> Load the extension.
    <ol type="a">
      <li>
      Bring up the extensions management page
      by clicking the Tools menu
      <img src="images/toolsmenu.gif" width="43" height="34" alt=""
           align="absmiddle" style="margin:0; padding:0">and
      choosing <b>Extensions</b>.
      </li>

      <li>
      If <b>Developer mode</b> has a + by it,
      click the + to add developer information to the page.
      The + changes to a -,
      and more buttons and information appear.
      </li>

      <li>
      Click the <b>Load extension...</b> button.
      A file dialog appears.
      </li>

      <li>
      In the file dialog,
      navigate to your extension's folder
      (<code>c:\myext</code>, for example)
      and click <b>OK</b>.
      </li>
    </ol> </li>
  </ol>

<p>
If your extension is valid,
its icon appears next to the address bar,
and information about the extension
appears in the extensions page,
as the following screenshot shows.
</p>

<p>
<a href="images/load_after.png"><img
  src="images/load_after_small.png"
  width="300" height="132" /></a>
</p>

<h2 id="code">Add code to the extension</h2>
<p> In this step, you'll make your extension <em>do</em> something besides just look good. </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p> Edit <code>manifest.json</code> to add the following line:</p>
<pre>
  ...
  "browser_action": {
    "default_icon": "icon.png"<b>,
    "popup": "popup.html"</b>
  },
  ...
</pre>
    <p> Inside your extension's folder,
    create a text file called <strong><code>popup.html</code></strong>,
    and add the following code to it:</p>
    <blockquote> <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/tutorials/getstarted/popup.html?content-type=text/plain"
    target="_blank">CSS
    and JavaScript code for hello_world</a></blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    Return to the extensions management page,
    and click the <b>Reload</b> button
    to load the new version of the extension.</li>
  <li>Click the extension's icon.
  A popup should appear that displays the contents of
  <code>popup.html</code>. </li>
</ol>
<p> It should look something like this:</p>

<img src="images/hello-world.png"
  width="500" height="369"
  alt="a popup with a grid of images related to HELLO WORLD" />

<p> If you don't see the popup,
try the instructions again,
following them exactly.
Don't try loading an HTML file that isn't in the extension's folder &mdash;
it won't work! </p>

<h2 id="summary">Now what?</h2>
