<p>
If your extension is hosted in Google's
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions">gallery</a>,
<em>ignore this page</em>.
You don't need to worry about HTTP headers
because the gallery handles them for you.
</p>

<p>
If you intend to use another server,
make sure it serves appropriate HTTP headers,
so that users can install your extension
by clicking a link to it.

Google Chrome considers a file to be an extension
if <b>either</b> of the following is true:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The file has the content type
    <code>application/x-chrome-extension</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    The file suffix is <code>.crx</code>
    and <b>both</b> of the following are true:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The file <b>is not</b> served with
        the HTTP header <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        The file <b>is</b> served
        with one of the following content types:
        <ul>
          <li> empty string </li>
          <li> "text/plain" </li>
          <li> "application/octet-stream" </li>
          <li> "unknown/unknown" </li>
          <li> "application/unknown" </li>
          <li> "*/*" </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The most common reason for failing to recognize an extension
is that the server sends the header
<code>X-Content-Type-Options: no sniff</code>.
The second most common reason
is that the server sends an unknown content type &mdash;
one that isn't in the previous list.
To fix an HTTP header issue,
either change the configuration of the server
or try hosting the extension at another server.
