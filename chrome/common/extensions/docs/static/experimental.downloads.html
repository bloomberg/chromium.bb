<p>The downloads API allows you to programmatically initiate downloads. In the
future, you will also be able to monitor and manipulate downloads.</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>The downloads API is currently experimental, so you must declare the
"experimental" permission to use it. Also, you must specify the hostname of any
URLs to be downloaded. For example:</p>

<pre>{
  "name": "Download Selected Links",
  "description": "Select links on a page and download them.",
  "version": "0.1",
  "permissions": [
    "experimental", "http://*/*", "https://*/*"
  ]
}</pre>

<p>If the URL’s hostname is not specified in the permissions, then
<a href='extension.html#property-lastError'>chrome.extension.lastError</a>
will indicate that the extension does not have permission to access that
hostname.  <a href="#properties">downloads.ERROR_*</a> are some of the errors
that may be returned.</p>

<h2 id="examples"> Examples </h2>

<p>You can find simple examples of using the downloads module in the
<a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/api/downloads/">examples/api/downloads</a>
directory. For other examples and for help in viewing the source code, see
