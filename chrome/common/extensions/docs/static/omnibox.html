<p>
The omnibox API allows you to register a
keyword with Google Chrome's address bar,
which is also known as the omnibox.
</p>

<p>
<img src="images/omnibox.png" width="300" height="150"
  alt="A screenshot showing suggestions related to the keyword 'Chromium Search'"/>
</p>

<p>
When the user enters your extension's
keyword, the user starts
interacting solely with your extension.
Each keystroke is sent to your
extension, and you can provide suggestions
in response.
</p>

<p>
The suggestions can be richly formatted
in a variety of ways.
<!-- PENDING: for example? (include a mention of method name, maybe show a code snippet) -->
When the user accepts
a suggestion, your extension is notified
and can take action.
</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>
You must include an <code>omnibox</code> <code>keyword</code> field
in the <a href="manifest.html">manifest</a> 
to use the omnibox API.
You should also
specify a 16x16-pixel icon, which will be
displayed in the address bar when suggesting that users
enter keyword mode.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<pre>{
  "name": "Aaron's omnibox extension",
  "version": "1.0",
  <b>"omnibox": { "keyword" : "aaron" },</b>
  <b>"icons": {</b>
    <b>"16": "16-full-color.png"</b>
  <b>},</b>
  "background_page": "background.html"
}</pre>

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong>
Chrome automatically creates a grayscale version of
your 16x16-pixel icon. You should provide
a full-color version so that it can also be
used in other situations that require color.
For example, the <a href="contextMenus.html"
>context menus API</a> also uses a 16x16-pixel
icon, but it is displayed in color.
</p>


<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>
You can find samples of this API on the
<a href="samples.html#omnibox">sample page</a>.
