<p>
The savePage API allows you to save a tab as MHTML.
</p>

<p>
MHTML is a <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2557">standard format</a>
supported by most browsers. It encapsulates in a single file a page and all
its resources (CSS files, images..).
</p>

<p>
Note that for security reasons a MHTML file can only be loaded from the file
system and that it can only be loaded in the main frame.

<p>
The savePage API is currently
experimental, so you must declare the "experimental"
permission to use it.
