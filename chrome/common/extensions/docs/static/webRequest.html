<p id="classSummary">
Use the <code>chrome.webRequest</code> module to intercept, block,
or modify requests in-flight. This module is still experimental. For
information on how to use experimental APIs, see the
<a href="experimental.html">chrome.experimental.* APIs</a> page.
</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>
<p>You must declare the "webRequest" permission in the <a
  href="manifest.html">extension manifest</a> to use the webRequest settings
API, along with <a href="manifest.html#permissions">host permissions</a>
for any hosts whose network requests you want to access. If you want to
use the webRequest API in a blocking fashion, you need to request
the "webRequestBlocking" permission in addition.
For example:</p>
<pre>{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  <b>"permissions": [
    "webRequest",
    "*://*.google.com"
  ]</b>,
  ...
}</pre>

<h2 id="life_cycle">Life-cycle of requests</h2>

<p>
The webRequest API defines the following events:
<dl>
  <dt><code>onBeforeRequest (optionally synchronous)</code></dt>
  <dd>Fires when a request is about to occur. This is sent before any TCP
  connection is made and can be used to cancel or redirect requests.</dd>
  <dt><code>onBeforeSendHeaders (optionally synchronous)</code></dt>
  <dd>Fires when a request is about to occur and the initial headers are
  prepared. The event is intended to allow extensions to add, modify and delete
  request headers <a href="#life_cycle_footnote">(*)</a>. The
  <code>onBeforeSendHeaders</code> event is passed to all subscribers, so
  different subscribers may attempt to modify the request, see section <a
    href="#conflict_resolution">conflict resolution</a> for details how this is
  handled. This event can still be used to cancel the request.</dd>
  <dt><code>onSendHeaders</code></dt>
  <dd>Fires after all extensions had a chance of modifying the request headers
  and presents the final <a href="#life_cycle_footnote">(*)</a> version. The
  event is triggered, before the headers are sent to the network. This event is
  informational and handled asynchronously. It does not allow to modify or
  cancel the request.</dd>
  <dt><code>onHeadersReceived (optionally synchronous)</code></dt>
  <dd>Fires each time when a HTTP(S) response header has been received. Due
  to redirects and authentication requests this can happen multiple times per
  request. This event is intended to allow extensions to add, modify and delete
  response headers, like incoming Set-Cookie headers for example.</dd>
  <dt><code>onAuthRequired (optionally synchronous)</code></dt>
  <dd>Fires when a request requires authentication of the user. This signal can
  be handled synchronously to provide authentication credentials. Note that
  extensions may provide invalid credentials. Take care not to enter an infinite
  loop by repeatedly providing invalid credentials.</dd>
  <dt><code>onBeforeRedirect</code></dt>
  <dd>Fires before a redirect is about to be executed. A redirection can be
  triggered by a HTTP response code or by an extension. This event is
  informational and handled asynchronously. It does not allow you to modify or
  cancel the request. </dd>
  <dt><code>onResponseStarted</code></dt>
  <dd>Fires when the first byte of the response body is received. For HTTP
  requests, this means that the status line and response headers are
  available. This event is informational and handled asynchronously. It does not
  allow to modify or cancel the request.</dd>
  <dt><code>onCompleted</code></dt>
  <dd>Fires when a request has been processed successfully.</dd>
  <dt><code>onErrorOccurred</code></dt>
  <dd>Fires when a request could not be processed successfully.</dd>
</dl>
The webRequest API gurantees that for each request either
<code>onComplete</code> or <code>onErrorOccurred</code> is fired as the final
event.
</p>

<p>
The life-cycle of successful requests can be illustrated as follows:
<pre>

<em>Note that this diagram does not capture a bug that will be fixed soon: If
extensions redirect a URL request via the webRequest API, this redirection does
not trigger <code>onBeforeRedirect</code>. Instead the request is cancelled
and a new request is started at <code>onBeforeRedirect</code>. See <a
  href="http://crbug.com/79520">http://crbug.com/79520</a>.</em>
</p>

<p id="life_cycle_footnote">(*) Note that the webRequest API presents an
abstraction of the network stack to the extension. Internally, one URL request
can be split into several HTTP requests (for example to fetch individual byte
ranges from a large file) or can be handled by the network stack without
communicating with the network. For this reason, the API does not provide the
final HTTP headers that are sent to the network. For example all headers that
are related to caching are invisible to the extension.</p>

<p>This is a list of headers that are currently not provided to the
onBeforeSendHeaders signal. The list is not guaranteed to be complete nor
stable:
<ul>
  <li>Authorization</li>
  <li>Cache-Control</li>
  <li>Connection</li>
  <li>Content-Length</li>
  <li>Host</li>
  <li>If-Modified-Since</li>
  <li>If-None-Match</li>
  <li>If-Range</li>
  <li>Partial-Data</li>
  <li>Pragma</li>
  <li>Proxy-Authorization</li>
  <li>Proxy-Connection</li>
  <li>Transfer-Encoding</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts of the webRequest API</h2>

<p>The signals of the webRequest API follow certain concepts and patterns that
shall be described in the following.</p>

<h3 id="Request IDs">Request IDs</h3>

<p>Each request is identified by a request ID. This ID is unique within a
browser session and the context of an extension. It remains constant during the
the life-cycle of a request and can be used to match signals for the same
request. Note that several HTTP requests are mapped to one webRequest in case of
HTTP redirection or HTTP authentication.</p>

<h3 id="subscription">Subscription</h3>

<p>For each signal XXX of the webRequest API, the API provides a function
<code>chrome.webRequest.XXX.addListener()</code> with the following
signature.</p>

<pre>
var callback = function(details) {...};
var opt_filter = {...};
var opt_extraInfoSpec = [...];

chrome.webRequest.XXX.addListener(
  callback, opt_filter, opt_extraInfoSpec);
</pre>

<p>Each <code>addListener()</code> call takes a mandatory callback function as
the first parameter. This callback function is passed a dictionary containing
information about the current URL request. The information in this dictionary
depends on the specific event type as well as the content of
<code>opt_extraInfoSpec</code>.</p>

<p>If the optional <code>opt_extraInfoSpec</code> array contains the string
<code>'blocking'</code> (only allowed for specific signals), the callback
function is handled synchronously. That means that the request is blocked until
the callback function returns. In this case, the callback can return a <a
  href="#type-BlockingResponse">BlockingResponse</a> that determines the further
life-cycle of the request. Depending on the context, this response allows
cancelling or redirecting a request (onBeforeRequest), cancelling or
modifying headers (onBeforeSendHeaders, onHeadersReceived), or providing
authentication credentials (onAuthRequired).</p>

<p>Depending on the specific signal, <code>opt_extraInfoSpec</code> may contain
further strings that indicate that specific information shall be passed to the
extension. This is used to provide detailed information on requests data only if
explicitly requested.</p>

<p>The optional <a href="#type-RequestFilter">RequestFilter</a>
<code>opt_filter</code> allows to limit the requests for which events are
triggered in various dimensions:
<dl>
  <dt>URLs</dt>
  <dd>URL patterns like <code>*://www.google.com/foo*bar</code>.</dd>
  <dt>Types</dt>
  <dd>Request types like <code>main_frame</code> (a document that is loaded for
  a top-level frame), <code>sub_frame</code> (a document that is loaded for an
  embedded frame), <code>image</code> (an image on a web site) and others. See
  <a href="#type-RequestFilter">RequestFilter</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Tab IDs</dt>
  <dd>The ID that identifies a specific tab in a window.</dd>
  <dt>Window IDs</dt>
  <dd>The ID that identifies a specific window.</dd>
</p>

<h2 id="conflict_resolution">Conflict resolution</h2>

<p>In the current implementation of the webRequest API, a request is considered
as canceled if at least one extension instructs to cancel the request. If
an extension cancels a request, all extensions are notified by an
onErrorOccurred event. Only one extension is allowed to redirect a request or
modify a header at a time. If more than one extension attempts to modify the
request, the most recently installed extension wins while all others are
ignored. An extension is currently not notified, if its instruction to modify or
redirect has been ignored.</p>

<h2>A note about caching</h2>
<p>
Chrome employs two caches, an on-disk cache and a very fast in-memory cache.
The life-time of an in-memory cache is attached to the life-time of a render
process which roughly corresponds to a tab. Requests that are answered from the
in-memory cache are invisible to the webRequest API. If a request handler
changes its behavior (for example the behavior according to which requests are
blocked), a simple page refresh might not respect this changed behavior.
<code>chrome.webRequest.handlerBehaviorChanged()</code> needs to be
called to flush the in-memory cache. This is a very expensive operation and
should not be done often.
</p>

<h2>A note about timestamps</h2>
<p>
It's important to note that some technical oddities in the OS's handling
of distinct Chrome processes can cause the clock to be skewed between the
browser itself and extension processes. That means that WebRequest's events'
<code>timeStamp</code> property is only guaranteed to be <i>internally</i>
consistent. Comparing one event to another event will give you the correct
offset between them, but comparing them to the current time inside the
extension (via <code>(new Date()).getTime()</code>, for instance) might give
unexpected results.
</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>The following example illustrates how to block all requests to
<code>www.evil.com</code>:</p>
<pre>
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  function(details) {
    return {cancel: details.url.indexOf("://www.evil.com/") != -1};
  },
  {},
  ["blocking"]);
</pre>

<p>As this function uses a blocking signal handler, it requires the "webRequest"
as well as the "webRequestBlocking" permission in the manifest file.</p>

<p>The following example achives the same goal in a more efficient way because
requests that are not targeted to <code>www.evil.com</code> do not need to be
passed to the extension:</p>
<pre>
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  function(details) { return {cancel: true}; },
  {urls: ["*://www.evil.com/*"]},
  ["blocking"]);
</pre>

<p>The following example illustrates how the User-Agent header can be deleted
from all requests:</p>
<pre>
chrome.webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders.addListener(
  function(details) {
    delete details.requestHeaders['User-Agent'];
    return {requestHeaders: details.requestHeaders};
  },
  {},
  ["blocking"]);
</pre>

<!--
TODO(mkwst): update this section. We do not pass windowIds any more.
http://crbug.com/98937

<h3 id="tracking_frames">Tracking frames</h3>
<p>For efficiency reason, the webRequest API does not pass the URL of the frame
that issued a request to each request. If this information is required, for
example to distinguish between first and third party requests, this example
shows how to track the URLs of frames.</p>
<pre>
// dictionary "windowId" -> "tabId"-"frameId" -> "frameUrl"
var frameUrl = {};

function recordFrameUrl(windowId, tabId, frameId, frameUrl) {
  if (!frameUrl[windowId]) {
    frameUrl[windowId] = {};
  }
  frameUrl[windowId][tabId + "-" + frameId] = frameUrl;
}

function getFrameUrl(windowId, tabId, frameId, frameUrl) {
  return (frameUrl[windowId] || {})[tabId + "-" + frameId];
}

chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  function(d) {
    if (d.type == 'main_frame' || d.type == 'sub_frame') {
      recordFrameUrl(d.windowId, d.tabId, d.frameId, d.frameUrl);
    }
    var frameUrl = getFrameUrl(d.windowId, d.tabId, d.frameId);
    // Use the frameUrl e.g. to selectively cancel requests.
    // Attention: The frameUrl can be undefined in some cases. Requests may not
    // originate from a frame (e.g. requests from extensions or shared workers).
  });

chrome.windows.onRemoved.addListener(
  function(windowId) {delete frameUrl[windowId];}
  );
</pre>
