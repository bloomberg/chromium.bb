<p>Page actions are a simple way to represent actions that can be taken on a page ("Email this page", "Share with Facebook", etc).</p>

<h2>User interface</h2>
<p>Page actions are displayed in the right side of the Omnibox. New actions get added to the left of the star:</p>

<img src="images/pageaction-omnibar-icons.png">

<p>A maximum of 8 (?) actions can appear at the top level, any additional ones overflow into a drop-down menu:</p>

<h2>Manifest</h2>

<p>Developers can include page actions in the manifest using the following syntax:</p>

<pre>"page_actions": [
    {
      "id": "myaction",  // chosen by developer, and should be unique within their extension
      "name": "Do action",
      "icons": ["favicon.png", "favicon2.png"]
    }
  ]</pre>

<p>Supported icon image formats include for example png, bmp, ico, jpg, gif. If an image larger than 16x16 is specified, it will be resized to fit.</p>
