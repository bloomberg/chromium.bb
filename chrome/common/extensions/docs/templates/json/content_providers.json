// === Overview ===
//
// This file configures where to find and how to serve content in the docserver.
// It's the most fundamentally important file in all of the docserver.
//
// === Format ===
//
// Each entry declares a rule with:
//  * An arbitrary identifier key e.g. "cr-extensions-examples".
//  * What URL the rule should be invoked with, given by "serveFrom", e.g.
//    "extensions/examples".
//  * An object describing where the content originates; currently the only
//    supported location is "chromium" with a key "dir" specifying which
//    chromium directory to look in, e.g. "extensions/samples".
//
// In this example, when the user navigates to
//
//    developer.chrome.com/extensions/examples/some/sample/path
//
// then
//  1. The "cr-extensions-examples" rule is invoked (since it's served from
//     "extensions/examples").
//  2. The docserver will look up the path "docs/examples/some/sample/path"
//     in chromium - the URL after the "serveFrom" path (some/sample/path)
//     prefixed by the chromium directory (docs/examples).
//  3. Then render and serve it.
//
// === Special properties ===
//
// There are some other properties that can be specified:
//  * "supportsZip" indicates whether directories are allowed to be served as
//    zip files. For safety this isn't supported for arbitrary URLs, only those
//    within a rule that has "supportsZip": true.
//  * "supportsTemplates" indicates whether HTML files should be treated and
//    renderered as templates, versus just plain text. Complex documentation
//    which interacts with docserver features (like API listing) need to set
//    this to true. Otherwise, it's safer and more efficient to omit it.
