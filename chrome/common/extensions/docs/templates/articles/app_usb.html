<h1>USB Devices</h1>

<p>
This document describes how to use the <a href="usb">USB API</a> to communicate
with USB devices. Some devices are not accessible through the USB API
(see the <a href="#caveats">Caveats</a> section below for details).
Chrome Apps can also connect to <a href="serial">serial</a> and
<a href="bluetooth">Bluetooth</a> devices.
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>Samples:</b> For examples that illustrate how Chrome Apps can connect to hardware devices, see the
<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/samples/serial">serial</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples/tree/master/samples/servo">servo</a>, and

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest requirement</h2>

<p>The USB API requires the "usb" permission in the manifest file:</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"permissions": [
  "usb"
]
</pre>

<p>In addition, in order to prevent
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint">finger-printing</a>,
  you must declare all the device types you want to access in the manifest file.
  Each type of USB device corresponds to a vendor id/product id (VID/PID) pair.
  You can use $(ref:usb.getDevices) to enumerate devices by their VID/PID
  pair.
</p>
<p>
  You must declare the VID/PID pairs for each type of device you want to use
  under the <code>usbDevices</code> permission in your app's manifest file, as
  shown in the example below:</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"permissions": [
  {
    "usbDevices": [
      {
        "vendorId": 123,
        "productId": 456
      }
    ]
  }
]
</pre>

<p class="note">Note that only decimal numbers are allowed in JSON format.
  You cannot use hexadecimal numbers in these fields.</p>

<p>Since <b>Chrome 57</b>, the requirement for declaring all the device types
  in the app manifest is relaxed for apps running as Chrome OS
  <a href="apps/manifest/kiosk_enabled">kiosk apps</a>.
  For kiosk apps, you can use the <code>interfaceClass</code> permission
  property to request permission to access USB devices that:
  <ul>
    <li>implement a USB interface of a specific interface class</li>
    <li>have a specific USB device class</li>
  </ul>
  For example, the following <code>usbDevices</code> permission would grant an
  app access to all USB devices that implement a printer interface (interface
  class code 7), and to USB hub devices (device class code 9):</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"permissions": [
  {
    "usbDevices": [
      {"interfaceClass": 7},
      {"interfaceClass": 9}
    ]
  }
]
</pre>

<p>For the list of acceptable <code>interfaceClass</code> values, see
  <a href="http://www.usb.org/developers/defined_class">USB Class Codes</a>.
  </p>

<p>The <code>interfaceClass</code> property can be combined with the
  <code>vendorId</code> property to get access only to USB devices from a
  specific vendor, as demonstrated by the following example:</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"permissions": [
  {
    "usbDevices": [
      {
        "vendorId": 123,
        "interfaceClass": 7
      }
    ]
  }
]
</pre>

<p class="note">Note that <code>usbDevices</code> permissions with
  <code>interfaceClass</code> property have effect only when the app is running
  in kiosk session - outside a kiosk session these permissions will be ignored.
  </p>

<h2 id="finding_device">Finding a device</h2>

<p>
  To determine whether one or more specific devices are connected to a user's
  system, use the $(ref:usb.getDevices) method:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.usb.getDevices(enumerateDevicesOptions, callback);
</pre>

<br/>

<table class="simple">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Parameter (type)</th>
    <th scope="col">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>EnumerateDevicesOptions (object)</td>
    <td>An object specifying both a <code>vendorId</code> (long) and
      <code>productId</code> (long) used to find the correct type of device on
      the bus. Your manifest must declare the <code>usbDevices</code> permission
      section listing all the <code>vendorId</code> and <code>deviceId</code>
      pairs your app wants to access.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>callback (function)</td>
    <td>Called when the device enumeration is finished. The callback will be
      executed with one parameter, an array of <code>Device</code> objects with
      three properties: <code>device</code>, <code>vendorId</code>,
      <code>productId</code>. The device property is a stable identifier for a
      connected device. It will not change until the device is unplugged. The
      detail of the identifier is opaque and subject to change. Do not rely on
      its current type. <br/>
      If no devices are found, the array will be empty.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
function onDeviceFound(devices) {
  this.devices=devices;
  if (devices) {
    if (devices.length > 0) {
      console.log("Device(s) found: "+devices.length);
    } else {
      console.log("Device could not be found");
    }
  } else {
    console.log("Permission denied.");
  }
}

chrome.usb.getDevices({"vendorId": vendorId, "productId": productId}, onDeviceFound);
</pre>

<h2 id="usb_open">Opening a device</h2>
<p>
Once the <code>Device</code> objects are returned, you can open a device using
usb.openDevice to obtain a connection handle. You can only
communicate with USB devices using connection handles.
</p>

<table class="simple">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Property</th>
    <th scope="col">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>device</td>
    <td>Object received in $(ref:usb.getDevices) callback.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data (arraybuffer)</td>
    <td>Contains the data sent by the device if the transfer was inbound.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
var usbConnection = null;
var onOpenCallback = function(connection) {
  if (connection) {
    usbConnection = connection;
    console.log("Device opened.");
  } else {
    console.log("Device failed to open.");
  }
};

chrome.usb.openDevice(device, onOpenCallback);
</pre>

<p class="note">
Not every device can be opened successfully. In general, operating systems
lock down many types of USB interfaces (e.g. keyboards and mice, mass storage
devices, webcams, etc.) and they cannot be claimed by user applications.
On Linux (other than Chrome OS), once an interface of a device is locked down by
the OS, the whole device is locked down (because all the interfaces shares the
same device file), even if the other interfaces of the device can be used in
theory. On Chrome OS, you can request access to unlocked interfaces using the
$(ref:usb.requestAccess) method. If permitted, the permission broker will
unlock the device file for you.
</p>

<p>
To simplify the opening process, you can use the $(ref:usb.findDevices)
method, which enumerates, requests access, and opens devices in one call:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.usb.findDevices({"vendorId": vendorId, "productId": productId, "interfaceId": interfaceId}, callback);
</pre>
<p>which is equivalent to:</p>
<pre>
chrome.usb.getDevices({"vendorId": vendorId, "productId": productId}, function (devices) {
  if (!devices) {
    console.log("Error enumerating devices.");
    callback();
    return;
  }
  var connections = [], pendingAccessRequests = devices.length;
  devices.forEach(function (device) {
    chrome.usb.requestAccess(interfaceId, function () {
      // No need to check for errors at this point.
      // Nothing can be done if an error occurs anyway. You should always try
      // to open the device.
      chrome.usb.openDevices(device, function (connection) {
        if (connection) connections.push(connection);
        pendingAccessRequests--;
        if (pendingAccessRequests == 0) {
          callback(connections);
        }
      });
    });
  })
});
</pre>

<h2 id="usb_transfers">USB transfers and receiving data from a device</h2>

<p>
  The USB protocol defines four types of transfers:
  <a href="#control_transfers">control</a>,
  <a href="#bulk_transfers">bulk</a>,
  <a href="#isochronous_transfers">isochronous</a>
  and <a href="#interrupt_transfers">interrupt</a>.
  These transfers are described below.
</p>

<p>
  Transfers can occur in both directions: device-to-host (inbound), and
  host-to-device (outbound). Due to the nature of the USB protocol,
  both inbound and outbound messages must be initiated by the host (the
  computer that runs the Chrome app).
  For inbound (device-to-host) messages, the host (initiated by your JavaScript
  code) sends a message flagged as "inbound" to the device.
  The details of the message depend on the device, but usually will have
  some identification of what you are requesting from it.
  The device then responds with the requested data.
  The device's response is handled by Chrome and delivered asynchronously to the
  callback you specify in the transfer method.
  An outbound (host-to-device) message is similar, but the response doesn't
  contain data returned from the device.
</p>

<p>
  For each message from the device, the specified callback will receive an event
  object with the following properties:
</p>

<br>

<table class="simple">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Property</th>
    <th scope="col">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>resultCode (integer)</td>
    <td>0 is success; other values indicate failure. An error string can be<br/>
      read from <code>chrome.extension.lastError</code> when a failure is<br/>
      indicated.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data (arraybuffer)</td>
    <td>Contains the data sent by the device if the transfer was inbound.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
var onTransferCallback = function(event) {
   if (event && event.resultCode === 0 && event.data) {
     console.log("got " + event.data.byteLength + " bytes");
   }
};

chrome.usb.bulkTransfer(connectionHandle, transferInfo, onTransferCallback);
</pre>

<h2 id="control_transfers">CONTROL transfers</h2>

<p>Control transfers are generally used to send or receive configuration or
  command parameters to a USB device. The controlTransfer method always sends
  to/reads from endpoint 0, and no claimInterface is required.
  The method is simple and receives three parameters:</p>

<pre>
chrome.usb.controlTransfer(connectionHandle, transferInfo, transferCallback)
</pre>

<br>

<table class="simple">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Parameter (types)</th>
    <th scope="col">Description</th>

  <tr>
    <td>connectionHandle</td>
    <td>Object received in $(ref:usb.openDevice) callback.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>transferInfo</td>
    <td>Parameter object with values from the table below. Check your USB
      device protocol specification for details.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>transferCallback()</td>
    <td>Invoked when the transfer has completed.</td>
  </tr>

    <td>"device", "interface", "endpoint" or "other".</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>direction (string)</td>
    <td>"in" or "out". The "in" direction is used to notify the device that<br/>
        it should send information to the host. All communication on a USB<br/>
        bus is host-initiated, so use an "in" transfer to allow a device to<br/>
        send information back.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>request (integer)</td>
    <td>Defined by your device's protocol.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>value (integer)</td>
    <td>Defined by your device's protocol.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>index (integer)</td>
    <td>Defined by your device's protocol.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>length (integer)</td>
    <td>Only used when direction is "in". Notifies the device that this is
      the amount of data the host is expecting in response.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data (arraybuffer)</td>
    <td>Defined by your device's protocol, required when direction is
      "out".
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
var transferInfo = {
  "requestType": "vendor",
   "recipient": "device",
  "direction": "out",
  "request":  0x31,
  "value": 120,
  "index": 0,
  // Note that the ArrayBuffer, not the TypedArray itself is used.
  "data": new Uint8Array([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]).buffer
};
chrome.usb.controlTransfer(connectionHandle, transferInfo, optionalCallback);
</pre>

<h2 id="isochronous_transfers">ISOCHRONOUS transfers</h2>

<p>Isochronous transfers are the most complex type of USB transfer. They are
  commonly used for streams of data, like video and sound. To initiate an
  isochronous transfer (either inbound or outbound), you must use
  the $(ref:usb.isochronousTransfer) method:</p>

<pre>
chrome.usb.isochronousTransfer(connectionHandle, isochronousTransferInfo, transferCallback)
</pre>

<br/>

<table class="simple">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Parameter</th>
    <th scope="col">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>connectionHandle</td>
    <td>Object received in $(ref:usb.openDevice) callback.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>isochronousTransferInfo</td>
    <td>Parameter object with the values in the table below.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>transferCallback()</td>
    <td>Invoked when the transfer has completed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  Values for
  <code>isochronousTransferInfo</code>
  object:
</p>

<table class="simple">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Value</th>
    <th scope="col">Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>transferInfo (object)</td>
    <td>An object with the following attributes:<br/>
      <b>direction (string): </b>"in" or "out".<br/>
      <b>endpoint (integer): </b>defined by your device. Usually can be found by
      looking at an USB instrospection tool, like <code>lsusb -v</code><br/>
      <b>length (integer): </b>only
      used when direction is "in". Notifies the device that this is the amount
      of data the host is expecting in response. <br/>

      Should be AT LEAST <code>packets</code> &times; <code>packetLength</code>.
      <br/>
      <b>data (arraybuffer): </b>defined by your device's protocol;
      only used when direction is "out".
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>packets (integer)</td>
    <td>Total number of packets expected in this transfer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>packetLength (integer)</td>
    <td>Expected length of each packet in this transfer.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>
var transferInfo = {
  "direction": "in",
  "endpoint": 1,
  "length": 2560
};

var isoTransferInfo = {
  "transferInfo": transferInfo,
  "packets": 20,
  "packetLength": 128
};

chrome.usb.isochronousTransfer(connectionHandle, isoTransferInfo, optionalCallback);
</pre>

<p class="note">
  <b>Notes:</b> One isochronous transfer will contain
  <code>isoTransferInfo.packets</code> packets of
  <code>isoTransferInfo.packetLength</code> bytes.
  If it is an inbound transfer (your code requested data from the device), the
  <code>data</code> field in the onUsbEvent will be an ArrayBuffer of size
  <code>transferInfo.length</code>. It is your duty to walk through this
  ArrayBuffer and extract the different packets, each starting at a multiple of
  <code>isoTransferInfo.packetLength</code> bytes. <br/>
  <br/>
  If you are expecting a stream of data from the device, remember that
  you will have to send one "inbound" transfer for each transfer you expect
  back. USB devices don't send transfers to the USB bus unless the host
  explicitly requests them through "inbound" transfers.
</p>

<h2 id="bulk_transfers">BULK transfers</h2>

<p>Bulk transfers are commonly used to transfer a large amount of
  non-time-sensitive data in a reliable way.
  $(ref:usb.bulkTransfer) has three parameters:</p>

<pre>
chrome.usb.bulkTransfer(connectionHandle, transferInfo, transferCallback);
</pre>

<br>

<table class="simple">

  "endpoint": 1,
  "data": new Uint8Array([4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]).buffer
};
</pre>

<h2 id="interrupt_transfers">INTERRUPT transfers</h2>

<p>Interrupt transfers are used to small amount of time sensitive data.
  Since all USB communication is initiated by the host, host code usually polls
  the device periodically, sending interrupt IN transfers that will make the
  device send data back if there is anything in the interrupt queue (maintained
  by the device).
  $(ref:usb.interruptTransfer) has three parameters:</p>

<pre>
chrome.usb.interruptTransfer(connectionHandle, transferInfo, transferCallback);
</pre>

<br>

<table class="simple">
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Parameter</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>transferCallback</td>
    <td>Invoked when the transfer has completed. Notice that this callback
      doesn't contain the device's response. The purpose of the callback is

      been processed.
    </td>

  Values for <code>transferInfo</code> object:
</p>

<table class="simple">

</pre>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<p>Not all devices can be accessed through the USB API. In general, devices
  are not accessible because either the Operating System's kernel or a native
  driver holds them off from user space code. Some examples are devices with
  HID profiles on OSX systems, and USB pen drives.</p>

<p>
  On most Linux systems, USB devices are mapped with read-only permissions by
  default. To open a device through this API, your user will need to have
  write access to it too.
  A simple solution is to set a udev rule. Create a file
  <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/50-yourdevicename.rules</code>
  with the following content:
</p>

<pre>
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="[yourdevicevendor]", MODE="0664", GROUP="plugdev"
</pre>

<p>
  Then, just restart the udev daemon: <code>service udev restart</code>.
  You can check if device permissions are set correctly by following these
  steps:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run <code>lsusb</code> to find the bus and device numbers.</li>
  <li>Run <code>ls -al /dev/bus/usb/[bus]/[device]</code>. This file should be
    owned by group "plugdev" and have group write permissions.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Your app cannot do this automatically since this this procedure requires root
access. We recommend that you provide instructions to end-users and link to the
<a href="#caveats">Caveats</a> section on this page for an explanation.</p>

<p>On Chrome OS, simply call $(ref:usb.requestAccess). The permission
  broker does this for you.</p>
