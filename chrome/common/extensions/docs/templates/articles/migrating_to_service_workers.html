<h1 id="title">
  Migrating from Background Pages to Service Workers
</h1>

<p>
  Background pages have been a fundamental component of the Chrome Extension
  platform since its introduction. To put it simply, background pages provide
  extension authors with an environment that lives independent of any other
  window or tab. This allows extensions to observe and take action in response
  to events.
</p>

<p>
  In <a href="/migrating_to_manifest_v3">manifest version 3</a>, the Chrome
  extension platform will move from background pages to service workers. As
  stated in <a
  href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/">Service
  Workers: an Introduction</a>, a "service worker is a script that your browser
  runs in the background, separate from a web page, opening the door to features
  that don't need a web page or user interaction." This is the technology that
  enables native-like experiences such as push notifications, rich offline
  support, background sync, and "Add to Home Screen" on the open web. Service
  workers were inspired in part by background pages in Chrome Extensions, but
  they iterate and improve on this model by tuning it for web-scale.
</p>

<p>
  When migrating to this new background context, you'll need to keep two main
  things in mind. First, service workers are terminated when not in use and
  restarted when needed (similar to event pages). Second, service workers don't
  have access to DOM. We'll explore how to adapt to these challenges in the
  <a href="events">Thinking with Events</a> and <a href="workers">Working with
  Workers</a> sections below, respectively. If you already use an event page,
  skip straight to the second section.
</p>

<h2 id="events">
  Thinking With Events
</h2>

<p>
  Like event pages, service workers are a special execution environment that are
  started to handle events they're interested in and are terminated when they're
  no longer needed. The following sections provide recommendations for writing
  code in an ephemeral, evented execution context.
</p>

<p class="note">
  Note: Several of these concepts are covered in the Migrate to Event Driven
  Background Scripts article.
</p>

<h2 id="event_listeners">
  Top Level Event Listeners
</h2>

<p>
  In order for Chrome to successfully dispatch events to the appropriate
  listeners, extensions must register listeners in the first turn of the event
  loop. The most straightforward way to achieve this is to move event
  registration to the top-level of your service worker script.
</p>

<p>
  The below snippet shows how an existing extension initializes its browser
  action listener in a persistent background page.
</p>

<pre data-filename="background-page.js">
chrome.storage.local.get(['badgeText'], ({badgeText}) => {
  chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText({text: badgeText});

  // Listener is registered asynchronously.
  chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(handleActionClick);
});
</pre>

<p>
  While this approach works in a persistent background page, it is not
  guaranteed to work in a service worker due to the asynchronous nature of
  chrome.storage APIs. When a service worker is terminated, so are the event
  listeners associated with it. And since events are dispatched when a service
  worker starts, asynchronously registering events results in them being dropped
  because there's no listener registered when it is first spun up.
</p>

<p>
  To address this, move the event listener registration to the top level of your
  script. This ensures that Chrome will be able to immediately find and invoke
  your action's click handler, even if your extension hasn't finished executing
  its async startup logic.
</p>

<pre data-filename="background-sw.js">
chrome.storage.local.get(['badgeText'], ({badgeText}) => {
  chrome.action.setBadgeText({text: badgeText});
});

// Listener is registered on on startup.
chrome.action.onClicked.addListener(handleActionClick);
</pre>

<p class="note">
  Note: In manifest version 3 the <code>chrome.browserAction</code> and
  <code>chrome.pageAction</code> APIs are consolidated into a single
  chrome.action API.
</p>

<h3 id="state">
  Persisting State With Storage APIs
</h3>

<p>
  One of the main things to get used to when adopting service workers is that
  they are short-lived execution environments. In more practical terms, an
  extension's service worker will start up, do some work, and get terminated
  repeatedly throughout a user's browser session. This poses a challenge to
  extension developers accustomed to long-lived background pages as application
  data is not immediately available in global variables.
</p>

<p>
  This example is taken from a simple manifest version 2 extension that receives
  a name from a content script and persists it in a global variable for later
  use.
</p>

<pre data-filename="background-page.js">
let name = undefined;

chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(({type, name}) => {
  if (msg.type === 'set-name') {
    name = msg.name;
  }
});

chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(tab => {
  chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, {name});
});
</pre>

<p>
  If we port this code directly to a service worker, it's possible that the
  service worker will be terminated between when the name is set and the user
  clicks the browser action. If this happens, the set name will have been lost
  and name variable will again be undefined.
</p>

<p>
  We can fix this bug by treating the storage APIs as our source of truth.
</p>

<pre data-filename="background-sw.js">
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(({type, name}) => {
  if (type === 'set-name') {
    chrome.storage.local.set({name});
  }
});

chrome.action.onClicked.addListener(tab => {
  chrome.storage.local.get(['name'], ({name}) => {
    chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tab.id, {name});
  });
});
</pre>

<p class="note">
  Note: In manifest version 3 the chrome.browserAction and chrome.pageAction
  APIs are consolidated into a single chrome.action API.
</p>

<h3 id="alarms">
  Moving From Timers to Alarms
</h3>

<p>
  It's common for web developers to perform delayed or periodic operations using
  the <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>setInterval</code> methods. These APIs
  fail in service workers though, because the scheduler will cancel the timers
  when the service worker is terminated.
</p>

<pre data-filename="background-page.js">
const TIMEOUT = 3 * 60 * 1000;  // 3 minutes in milliseconds
window.setTimeout(function() {
  chrome.action.setIcon({
    path: getRandomIconPath()
  });
}, TIMEOUT);
</pre>

<p>
  Instead, we can use the alarms API. Like other listeners, alarm listeners
  should be registered in the top level of your script.
</p>

<pre data-filename="background-sw.js">
chrome.alarms.create({delayInMinutes: 3.0});

chrome.alarms.onAlarm.addListener(function() {
  chrome.action.setIcon({
    path: getRandomIconPath()
  });
});
</pre>

<h2 id="workers">
  Working with Workers
</h2>

<p>
  <a
  href="https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/introduction-to-service-worker">Service
  workers</a> are a specialized kind of <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker">web worker</a>,
  which are quite different from the web pages most web developers are used to
  working with. On a typical web page (or extension background page), the global
  execution context for JavaScript is a <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window">Window</a>.
  This object exposes the capabilities that web developers are used to working
  with: window, element, IndexedDB, cookie, localStorage, fetch, etc. The <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope">global
  scope for service worker</a> is significantly more limited and doesn't have
  many of these features. Most notably, service workers don't have access to the
  DOM.
</p>

<p>
  The following sections cover some of the major use cases impacted by the move
  to service workers and recommendations on how to adapt.
</p>

<h3 id="documents">
  Parsing and Traversing with XML/HTML
</h3>

<p>
  Since service workers don't have access to DOM, it's not possible for an
  extension's service worker to access the <a
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser">DOMParser</a>
  API or create iframes to parse and traverse documents. Extension developers
  have two ways to work around this limitation: create a new tab or use a
  library. Which you choose will depend on your use case.
</p>

<p>
  Libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom">jsdom</a> can be
  used to emulate a typical browser window environment, complete with DOMParser,
  event propagation, and other capabilities like requestAnimationFrame. Lighter
  weight alternatives like <a
  href="https://github.com/developit/undom">undom</a> provide just enough DOM to
  power many frontend frameworks and libraries.
</p>

<p>
  Extensions that need a full native browser environment can use the <a
  href="/windows#method-create">chrome.windows.create()</a> and <a
  href="/tabs#method-create">chrome.tabs.create()</a> APIs from inside a service
  worker. Additionally, an extension's popup still provides a full (temporary)
  window environment.
</p>

<h3 id="audio_vidio">
  Audio/Video Playback and Capture
</h3>

<p>
  It's not currently possible to play or capture media directly in a service
  worker. In order for a manifest version 3 extension to leverage the web's
  media playback and capture capabilities, the extension will need to create a
  window environment using either <a
  href="/windows#method-create">chrome.windows.create()</a> or <a
  href="/tabs#method-create">chrome.tabs.create()</a>. Once created, the
  extension can use <a href="/messaging">message passing</a> to coordinate
  between the playback document and service worker.
</p>

<h3 id="canvas">
  Rendering to a Canvas
</h3>

<p>
  In some cases developers use background pages to render content for display in
  other contexts or to create and cache assets. While service workers don't have
  access to DOM and therefore cannot use <code>&lt;canvas></code> elements,
  service workers do have access to the <a
  href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/canvas.html#the-offscreencanvas-interface">OffscreenCanvas
  API</a>.
</p>

<pre data-filename="background-page.js">
function makeCanvas(width, height) {
  const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
  canvas.width = width;
  canvas.height = height;
  return canvas;
}
</pre>

<p>
  In the above block we're constructing a canvas element and painting the entire
  canvas turquoise. To migrate to offscreen canvas, replace
  <code>document.createElement('canvas')</code> with <code>new
  OffscreenCanvas(width, height)</code>.
</p>

<pre data-filename="background-sw.js">
function makeCanvas(width, height) {
  const canvas = new OffscreenCanvas(width, height);
  return canvas;
}
</pre>

<p>
