<h1>Bluetooth</h1>

<p>
  This document describes how to use the <a href="bluetooth.html">Bluetooth
  API</a> to communicate with Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy devices.
</p>

<p>
  For background information about Bluetooth, see the official
  <a href="http://www.bluetooth.org">Bluetooth specifications</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest requirements</h2>

<p>
  For Chrome Apps that use Bluetooth, add the
  <a href="manifest/bluetooth.html">bluetooth</a> entry to the manifest
  and specify, if appropriate, the UUIDs of profiles you wish to implement.
  For example:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
"bluetooth": {
  "profiles": [ "1105", "1106" ]
}
</pre>

<p>
  To only access adapter state, discover nearby devices, and obtain basic
  information about devices, omit the <code>profiles</code> list.
</p>

<h2 id="adapter_state">Obtaining adapter state</h2>

<p>
  To obtain the state of the Bluetooth adapter, use the
  <code>chrome.bluetooth.getAdapterState</code> method:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getAdapterState(function(adapter) {
  console.log("Adapter " + adapter.address + ": " + adapter.name);
});
</pre>

<p>
  The <code>chrome.bluetooth.onAdapterStateChanged</code> event is sent
  whenever this state changes. This can be used, for example, to determine when
  the adapter radio is powered on or off.
</p>

<pre>
var powered = false;
chrome.bluetooth.getAdapterState(function(adapter) {
  powered = adapter.powered;
});

chrome.bluetooth.onAdapterStateChanged.addListener(
  function(adapter) {
    if (adapter.powered != powered) {
      powered = adapter.powered;
      if (powered) {
        console.log("Adapter radio is on");
      } else {
        console.log("Adapter radio is off");
      }
    }
  });
</pre>

<h2 id="listing_devices">Listing known devices</h2>

<p>
  To get a list of the devices known to the Bluetooth adapter, use the
  <code>chrome.bluetooth.getDevices</code> method:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    console.log(devices[i].address);
  }
});
</pre>

<p>
  All devices are returned, including paired devices and devices recently
  discovered. It will not begin discovery of new devices (see
  <a href="#discovery">Discovering nearby devices</a>).
</p>

<h2 id="device_notifications">Receiving device notifications</h2>

<p>
  Instead of repeatedly calling <code>chrome.bluetooth.getDevices</code>, you
  can use the <code>chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceAdded</code>,
  <code>chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceChanged</code> and
  <code>chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceRemoved</code> events to receive notifications.
</p>

<p>
  The <code>chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceAdded</code> event is sent whenever a
  device is discovered by the adapter or makes a connection to the adapter:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceAdded.addListener(function(device) {
  console.log(device.address);
});
</pre>

<p>
  Adding a listener for this event does not begin discovery of devices
  (see <a href="#discovery">Discovering nearby devices</a>).
</p>

<p>
  Changes to devices, including previously discovered devices becoming paired,
  are notified by the <code>chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceChanged</code> event:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceChanged.addListener(function(device) {
  console.log(device.address);
});
</pre>

<p>
  Finally the <code>chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceRemoved</code> event is sent
  whenever a paired device is removed from the system, or a discovered device
  has not been seen recently:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceRemoved.addListener(function(device) {
  console.log(device.address);
});
</pre>

<h2 id="discovery">Discovering nearby devices</h2>

<p>
  To begin discovery of nearby devices, use the
  <code>chrome.bluetooth.startDiscovery</code> method. Discovery can be
  resource intensive so you should call
  <code>chrome.bluetooth.stopDiscovery</code> when done.
</p>

<p>
  You should call <code>chrome.bletooth.startDiscovery</code> whenever your
  app needs to discover nearby devices. Do not check the
  <code>discovering</code> property of <code>AdapterState</code>. The call
  to start discovery will succeed even if another app is discovering nearby
  devices, and will ensure the adapter continues to perform discovery after
  that other app has stopped.
</p>

<p>
  Information about each newly discovered device is received using the
  <code>chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceAdded</code> event. For devices that have
  already been discovered recently, or have been previously paired with or
  connected to, the event will not be sent. Instead you should call
  <code>chrome.bluetooth.getDevices</code> to obtain the current information,
  and use the <code>chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceChanged</code> event to be notified of changes to that information as a result of discovery.
</p>

<p>
  Example:
</p>

<pre>
var device_names = {};
var updateDeviceName = function(device) {
  device_names[device.address] = device.name;
};
var removeDeviceName = function(device) {
  delete device_names[device.address];
}

// Add listeners to receive newly found devices and updates
// to the previously known devices.
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceAdded.addListener(updateDeviceName);
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceChanged.addListener(updateDeviceName);
chrome.bluetooth.onDeviceRemoved.addListener(removeDeviceName);

// With the listeners in place, get the list of devices found in
// previous discovery sessions, or any currently active ones,
// along with paired devices.
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    updateDeviceName(devices[i]);
  }
});

// Now begin the discovery process.
chrome.bluetooth.startDiscovery(function() {
  // Stop discovery after 30 seconds.
  setTimeout(function() {
    chrome.bluetooth.stopDiscovery(function() {});
  }, 30000);
});
</pre>

<p>
  If the user turns off the Bluetooth radio, all discovery sessions will be
  ended and not resumed automatically when the radio is switched on. If this
  matters to your app, you should watch the
  <code>chrome.bluetooth.onAdapterStateChanged</code> event. If the
  <code>discovering</code> property changes to <code>false</code>, then your app
  will need to call <code>chrome.bluetooth.startDiscovery</code> again to
  resume. Be cautious of the resource intensive nature of discovery.
</p>

<h2 id="identifying_devices">Identifying devices</h2>

<p>
  A number of different options are provided for identifying devices returned
  by <code>chrome.bluetooth.getDevices</code> and the related events.
</p>

<p>
  If the device supports the Bluetooth
  <a href="https://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/DI.aspx">Device ID specification</a>,
  several properties are added to the Device object containing the fields
  defined by that specification. Example:
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    if (devices[0].vendorIdSource != undefined) {
      console.log(devices[0].address + ' = ' +
                  devices[0].vendorIdSource + ':' +
                  devices[0].vendorId.toString(16) + ':' +
                  devices[0].productId.toString(16) + ':' +
                  devices[0].deviceId.toString(16));
    }
  }
});
</pre>

<p>
  The Device ID specification is usually sufficient to identify a particular
  model, and even revision, of a device from a vendor. Where it is not present,
  you must instead rely on information about the class or type of the device,
  optionally combined with the manufacturer prefix in the <code>address</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Most Bluetooth devices provide Class of Device information as a bit-field
  interpreted according to the
  <a href="https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/specification/assigned-numbers/baseband">Baseband Assigned Numbers</a>
  document. This bit-field is available in the <code>deviceClass</code>
  property.
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    if (devices[0].vendorIdSource != undefined) {
      console.log(devices[0].address + ' = ' +
                  devices[0].deviceClass.toString(16));
    }
  }
});
</pre>

<p>
  Parsing the field can be complex so for the most common device types Chrome
  handles this for you and sets the <code>type</code> field. Where this is
  not available, or insufficient for your needs, you'll need to parse the
  <code>deviceClass</code> yourself.
</p>

<pre>
chrome.bluetooth.getDevices(function(devices) {
  for (var i = 0; i < devices.length; i++) {
    if (devices[0].vendorIdSource != undefined) {
      console.log(devices[0].address + ' = ' + devices[0].type);
    }
  }
});
</pre>
