<h1>Reach Peak Performance</h1>
<p>
  Extensions are an addition to the browser,
  designed to provide supplementary and customized functionality.
  An extension that slows down or impairs the browsing experience
  is problematic to the user and counter to the Chrome extension objective.
  In addition to general good coding habits,
  developers should follow these practices
  to ensure their extension is running at peak performance.
</p>
<h2 id="defer_everything">Defer Everything Possible</h2>
<p>
  Refrain from loading resources until they are needed.
  Include only what is needed to open an extension
  in its startup function.
  Do not load things during startup that are only needed if the user
  clicks a button,
  or features that work only when the user is logged in
  before they have a chance to do so.
</p>
<h2 id="background_pages">Manage Important Events</h2>
<p>
  An efficient <a href="/background_pages">background script</a>
  contains registered events that are important to their extension.
  They lie dormant until a listener is triggered,
  act accordingly,
  then return to a dormant state.
  It is a drain on system resources to keep an unneeded script running.
</p>
<p>
  Background scripts should be registered in the manifest
  with their persistence set to false if possible.
</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "High Performance Extension",
  "description" : "Sleepy Background Script",
  "version": "1.0",
  ...
  <b>"background": {</b>
   <b>"scripts": ["background.js"],</b>
   <b>"persistent": false</b>
  <b>},</b>
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>
  The only occasion to keep a background script persistently active
  is if the extension uses
  <a href="/webRequest"><code>chrome.webRequest</code> API</a>
  to block or modify network requests.
  The webRequest API is incompatible with non-persistent background pages.

</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "High Performance Extension",
  "description" : "Persistent Background Script",
  "version": "1.0",
  ...
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"],
    <b>"persistent": true</b>
  },
  <b>"permissions": [</b>
    <b>"webRequest",</b>
    <b>"webRequestBlocking",</b>
    <b>"https://&lt;distracting social media site&gt;.com/*"</b>
  <b>]</b>,
 ...
 }
</pre>
<pre data-filename="background.js">
  chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
    function(details) {
      return {redirectUrl: "https://developer.chrome.com/"};
    },
    {urls: ["https://social.media.distraction.com/*"]},
    ["blocking"]
  );
</pre>
<h2 id="content_script">Contain Content Scripts</h2>
<p>
  <a href="/content_scripts">Content scripts</a>
  should work as the secret agents of an extension,
  subtly reading from or modifying the webpage
  while relying on the extension core to work heavier logic.
  They should have clear targets to avoid invasive activity on irrelevant pages.
  Ideally, content scripts should go unnoticed in the browsing experience
  aside from purposeful behavior.
</p>

<h3 id="declare_targets">Declare Targets</h3>
<p>
  An extension running content scripts in unnecessary locations
  or at inappropriate times can cause the browser to slow down
  and potentially create functionality errors.
  Avoid this by providing <a href="/match_patterns">match patterns</a>
  in the manifest and running the script at <code>document_idle</code>
  instead of <code>document_start</code>.
</p>
<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "High Performance Extension",
  "description" : "Superfly Superlight Content Scripts",
  "version": "1.0",
  ...
  <b>"content_scripts": [</b>
    <b>{</b>
      <b>"js": ["content_script.js"],</b>
      <b>"matches": ["https://developer.chrome.com/*"],</b>
      <b>"run_at": "document_idle"</b>
    <b>}</b>
  <b>]</b>
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>
  If an extension will only need to access a webpage with the user's action,
  have it <a href="/content_scripts#pi">injected programmatically</a>.
  A programmatic injection will only run when a user invokes it.
</p>
<pre data-filename="background.js">
  chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function(tab) {
    chrome.tabs.executeScript({
      code: 'document.body.style.fontSize="100px"'
    });
  });
</pre>
<h3 id="no_content_scripts">Use Content Scripts Only When Required</h3>
<p>
  Many extensions may not need a content script at all
  to accomplish desired functionality.
  Using the
  <a href="/declarativeContent"><code>declarativeContent</code> API</a>
  will set rules for the extension
  to recognize when relevant conditions are met.
  This is more efficient than a content script and uses less code!
</p>
<p>
  If an extension needed to display a page action to the user
  when they visited a site with an HTML5 <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element,
  it could specify a declarative rule.
</p>
<pre data-filename="background.js">
  chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(function() {
    chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.removeRules(undefined, function() {
      chrome.declarativeContent.onPageChanged.addRules([
        {
          conditions: [
            new chrome.declarativeContent.PageStateMatcher({
              css: ["video"],
            })
          ],
          actions: [ new chrome.declarativeContent.ShowPageAction() ]
        }
      ]);
    });
  });
</pre>

<h2 id="code">Evaluate Code Efficiency</h2>
<p>
  The same general practices for website performance
  can be applied to extensions such as
  implement techniques of asynchronous programming
  and keeping code minimal and compact.
</p>
<p>
Use tools, such as
<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">
  Lighthouse</a>,
  to evaluate an extensions performance and target areas that could improve
  on visual extension pages.
