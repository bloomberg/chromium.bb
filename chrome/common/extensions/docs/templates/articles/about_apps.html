<h1 id="what">What Are Chrome Apps?</h1>
<p>Chrome Apps let you use HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver an experience
comparable to a native application.</p>

<h2 id="why-build">Why build a Chrome App?</h2>

<p>By building a Chrome App, as opposed to going with a traditional web
app or a native mobile app, you expand your potential audience and extend your
development capability.
</p>

<h3 id="expand">Expand your potential audience</h3>

<p>When you write a Chrome App, as opposed to an app that runs natively on a
particular operating system, you immediately make your app available to a much
wider audience.</p>

<strong>To any desktop</strong>

<p>Instead of writing and maintaining separate applications for Windows, OS X
and Linux, you can write a single application that runs anywhere Chrome
runs. This includes Windows, Linux, and OS X.</p>

<strong>To mobile devices [via Cordova]</strong>

<p>Using <a href="apps/chrome_apps_on_mobile">Chrome
Apps for Mobile</a> (MCA), you can deploy your applications to mobile and target
hardware features only available on Android and IOS platforms. </p>

<strong>And of course, to a Chromebook</strong>

<p>Writing a Chrome App is the ONLY way to have your app installed on a
Chromebook. Chromebooks are appealing, inexpensive, low maintenance devices
that provide a full web experience.</p>

<h3 id="extend">Extend your development capability</h3>

<p>You might be thinking, “If I write a standard web application, I can run it
on any platform that has a web browser.” Of course, this is absolutely right,
but remember that Chrome Apps extend your development capacity beyond what you
can do with traditional web apps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chrome Apps can integrate seamlessly into the desktop and look
  more like desktop applications than traditional web apps.</li>
  <li>Chrome Apps for Desktop have no omnibox (address bar) and tab strip like
  normal browser-based apps, because like native desktop apps, they don’t live
  in a browser.</li>
  <li>The Chrome App Launcher makes it easy for users to find and start
  your Chrome App.</li>
  <li>OS X users can use the integrated spotlight search to find and start your
  app.</li>
  <li>Chrome Apps for Desktop can access the host computer’s file system and
  make use of hardware features (like USB, Bluetooth and attached human
  interface devices).</li>
</ul>

<p>The best way to see what Chrome Apps look like is to
<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/apps?_feature=chromeapp">
install some</a>.</p>

<h2 id="who">Who should build Chrome Apps?</h2>

<p>Everyone! But some sectors have a special interest in Chrome Apps. </p>

<strong>Device manufacturers</strong>

</p>The cross platform nature of Chrome Apps makes writing device drivers less
painful. A device manufacturer only needs to write one application for
configuring their device and it will run on any device.</p>

<strong>Educators</strong>

<p>Chromebooks are an inexpensive, low-maintenance option for bringing laptops
into every classroom. Chrome Apps make teaching easy with easy to install
applications that run natively on Chromebooks. For example:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://classroom.google.com/">Google Classroom</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://cloud.googleblog.com/2014/08/more-teaching-less-tech-ing-google.html">More
    Teaching, Less Tech-ing</a></li>
</ul>

<strong>Health care providers</strong>

<p>One pediatric service has so far
<a href="https://cloud.googleblog.com/2013/12/pediatric-home-service-puts-patient.html">saved
  tens of thousands of dollars</a> using Chrome Apps on Chromebooks.</p>
