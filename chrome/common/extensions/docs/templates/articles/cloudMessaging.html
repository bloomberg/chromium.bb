<h1 id="gcm">Google Cloud Messaging</h1>

<p>Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) is a service for both Android-powered devices and
Chrome instances to send and receive message data from servers. The
<a href="gcm.html">chrome.gcm</a> API allows the Chrome apps or extensions to access
the GCM service. The service works even if an app
or extension isn't currently running. For example, calendar updates could be
pushed to users even when their calendar app isn't open. </p>

<p>To use both API and service, you must agree to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/">Google APIs Terms of
Service</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud/terms/">Google Cloud Platform Terms
of Service</a>.</p>

<p>This document describes how to set up and use GCM. For additional information
see the reference documentation for the <a href="gcm.html">chrome.gcm</a> API and
the <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html">GCM Service</a>. To get
help with GCM or to give us feedback, please see

<h3 id="add_permission_to_manifest">Add permission to manifest</h3>

<p>To use the gcm service, you must declare the <code>gcm</code> permission in
<code>manifest.json</code>.</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json"><code>
"permissions": [
  "gcm", ... // Other permissions, like "storage"
]
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that running sample code below requires the <code>storage</code> permission as
well in order to persist some data via the <a href="storage.html">chrome.storage</a>
API.</p>

<h2 id="write_chrome_app_or_extension">Write Chrome App or Extension</h2>

<h3 id="obtain_gcm_registration_id">Obtain GCM registration ID</h3>

<p>Your app or extension needs to register with GCM servers before it can receive
messages. This is achieved by calling $(ref:gcm.register) and passing a list of
senders identified by project numbers from <a href="https://cloud.google.com/console/project">Google Developers
Console</a>. Your app or extension should
pass a callback function to verify if the registration succeeded or not, by
checking whether the error is set on <code>chrome.runtime.lastError</code> property. If the
registration is successful, an app or extension receives a registration ID,
which should be sent back to your application server in a secure way, for
example, via https. Otherwise, your app or extension should handle the error
identified by <code>chrome.runtime.lastError</code> and retry later.</p>

<p>If your app or extension wishes to receive messages from the different senders,
it can call $(ref:gcm.register) again with the new sender list and the new
registration ID will be returned.</p>

<pre data-filename="background.js"><code>
function registerCallback(registrationId) {
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
    // When the registration fails, handle the error and retry the
    // registration later.
    return;
  }

  // Send the registration ID to your application server.
  sendRegistrationId(function(succeed) {
    // Once the registration ID is received by your server,
    // set the flag such that register will not be invoked
    // next time when the app starts up.
    if (succeed)
      chrome.storage.local.set({registered: true});
  });
}

function sendRegistrationId(callback) {
  // Send the registration ID to your application server
  // in a secure way.
}

chrome.runtime.onStartup.addListener(function() {
  chrome.storage.local.get("registered", function(result) {
    // If already registered, bail out.
    if (result["registered"])
      return;

    // Up to 100 senders are allowed.
    var senderIds = ["Your-Sender-ID"];
    chrome.gcm.register(senderIds, registerCallback);
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>If your app or extension is installed in different profiles and/or in different
Chrome instances, each of them will receive a different registration ID.</p>

<p>Your app or extension could call $(ref:gcm.unregister) to revoke the registration ID.
The unregistration should only be done in rare cases, such as if your app or
extension does not want to receive further messages, or the registration ID is
suspected to be compromised.</p>

<pre data-filename="background.js"><code>
function unregisterCallback() {
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
    // When the unregistration fails, handle the error and retry
    // the unregistration later.
    return;
  }
}

chrome.gcm.unregister(unregisterCallback);
</code></pre>

<p>Your app or extension is automatically unregistered from the GCM service when a
user uninstalls it.</p>

<h3 id="receive_messages">Receive messages</h3>

<p>When your server wants to send a message to the user, it needs to connect to a
GCM connection server in one of two ways as described in the Android
<a href="http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/server.html">Implementing GCM Server</a>
document. The message specifies all of the registration IDs that are related to
that user. When the GCM server receives the message, it routes the message to
all instances of Chrome running apps or extensions with one of the registration
IDs. If your app or extension has been installed in more than one profiles in a
single Chrome instance, all of them can receive messages independently based on
their unique registration IDs.</p>

<p>Messages from the server are delivered via the $(ref:gcm.onMessage) event. Your app
or extension must register a handler to receive this event.</p>

<pre data-filename="background.js"><code>
chrome.gcm.onMessage.addListener(function(message) {
  // A message is an object with a data property that
  // consists of key-value pairs.
});
</code></pre>

<p>As long as Chrome is running, even if the extension or app is not running, it is
woken up to deliver a message.</p>

<h3 id="send_messages">Send messages</h3>

<p>In addition to delivering push messages from your server to the client, the GCM
supports sending upstream messages from the client to your server. Your server
should be set up to connect to GCM Cloud Connection Server as described in the
Android <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/ccs.html">GCM Cloud Connection
Server</a> document.</p>

<p>To send messages upstream, your app or extension should call $(ref:gcm.send) with an
object containing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Message ID that identifies the message when it fails to be queued or
delivered. The message ID can be any kind of string. However, it is
recommended to stay unique across the lifetime of your app or extension, even
after it restarts. If you use the same message ID, there may be a chance that
the previous message gets overridden. If an auto-increment counter is used to
create the message ID, your app or extension should persist the counter value
via <a href="storage.html">chrome.storage</a> API and restore it when the app
reloads.</li>
<li>Destination ID that identifies the server. This is the project number from the
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/console/project">Google Developers Console</a> plus the
suffix "@gcm.googleapis.com".</li>
<li>Data that consist of a list of string-to-string key value pairs (up to 4KB
total).</li>
<li>Time-to-live (TTL, optional). This property value must be a duration from 0 to
86,400 seconds (1 day) and it corresponds to the maximum period of time for
which GCM will store and try to deliver the message. If this property is not
set, it is default to the maximum value. When a TTL is set to 0, GCM will try
to deliver the message immediately. If the immediate effort fails, the message
will be discarded.</li>
</ul>

<p>When the callback passed in $(ref:gcm.send) is called without runtime error, it does
not mean that the message was already delivered to the GCM server. Rather, it
means that it was queued for delivery. Your app or extension should check and
handle <code>chrome.runtime.lastError</code>. Please refer to <a href="#error_reference">Error
reference</a> for possible error codes that could be
returned.</p>

<p>If the message fails to reach the destination within the specified TTL period,
for example due to network error, the $(ref:gcm.onSendError) will be fired. Your app
or extension can listen to this event and react to it, e.g. by trying to resend
the message. Please refer to <a href="#error_reference">Error reference</a> for
possible error codes that could be returned.</p>

<pre data-filename="background.js"><code>
// Substitute your own sender ID here. This is the project
// number you got from the Google Developers Console.
var senderId = "Your-Sender-ID";

// Make the message ID unique across the lifetime of your app.
// One way to achieve this is to use the auto-increment counter
// that is persisted to local storage.

// Message ID is saved to and restored from local storage.
var messageId = 0;
chrome.storage.local.get("messageId", function(result) {
  if (chrome.runtime.lastError)
    return;
  messageId = parseInt(result["messageId"]);
  if (isNaN(messageId))
    messageId = 0;
});

// Sets up an event listener for send error.
chrome.gcm.onSendError.addListener(sendError);

// Returns a new ID to identify the message.
function getMessageId() {
  messageId++;
  chrome.storage.local.set({messageId: messageId});
  return messageId.toString();
}

function sendMessage() {
  var message = {
    messageId: getMessageId(),
    destinationId: senderId + "@gcm.googleapis.com",
    timeToLive: 86400,    // 1 day
    data: {
      "key1": "value1",
      "key2": "value2"
    }
  };
  chrome.gcm.send(message, function(messageId) {
    if (chrome.runtime.lastError) {
      // Some error occurred. Fail gracefully or try to send
      // again.
      return;
    }

    // The message has been accepted for delivery. If the message
    // can not reach the destination, onSendError event will be
    // fired.
  });
}

function sendError(error) {
  console.log("Message " + error.messageId +
      " failed to be sent: " + error.errorMessage);

<h3 id="messages_deleted_event">Messages deleted event</h3>

<p>GCM will store up to 100 non-collapsible messages that are sent from your server
to your client. After that, all messages are discarded from GCM, and an event
$(ref:gcm.onMessagesDeleted) will be fired, which tells the client that it falls
behind. Your app or extension should respond by syncing with your application
server to recover the discarded messages.</p>

<pre data-filename="background.js"><code>
chrome.gcm.onMessagesDeleted.addListener(messagesDeleted);

function messagesDeleted() {
  // All messages have been discarded from GCM. Sync with
  // your application server to recover from the situation.
}
</code></pre>

<h3 id="collapsible_messages">Collapsible messages</h3>

<p>GCM messages are often a tickle, telling the app or extension to contact the
server for fresh data. In GCM, it's possible to create collapsible messages for
this situation, wherein new messages replace older ones. When a collapse key is
provided and multiple messages are queued up in the GCM servers for the same
user, only the last one with any given collapse key is delivered to your app or
extension. As a result the <code>message</code> object passed to the $(ref:gcm.onMessage) event
will contain a <code>collapseKey</code>field. For more details about sending collapsible
messages, please refer to the Android <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/adv.html#collapsible">GCM Advanced
Topics</a> document.</p>

<h3 id="implement_gcm_server">Implement GCM Server</h3>

<p>Currently GCM provides two connection servers: <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/http.html">GCM HTTP Connection
Server</a> and <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/ccs.html">GCM Cloud
Connection Server (XMPP)</a>. You
can use them separately or in tandem. Please refer to the Android <a href="http://developer.android.com/google/gcm/server.html">Implementing
GCM Server</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="error_reference">Error reference</h2>

<p>An error could occur when a gcm API function is called. Your app or extension
should check <code>chrome.runtime.lastError</code> for more information in your callback.
The error code will also be passed as a parameter to $(ref:gcm.onSendError) event.</p>

<p>Here's a brief summary of the gcm errors:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Function was called with invalid parameters</strong>: this could happen when gcm
functions are called with bad parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous operation is pending</strong>: this could happen when certain gcm
function is called again without waiting for the callback passed in previous
function to be called.</li>
<li><strong>Network error occurred</strong>: this could happen when GCM server fails to reach
due to network problem, like losing Internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Server error occurred</strong>: this could happen when GCM server fails to reach
due to server problem, like server busy.</li>
<li><strong>Time-to-live exceeded</strong>: this could happen when a message could not be
delivered within the specific time-to-live period.</li>
<li><strong>Unknown error occurred</strong>: this could happen due to any other internal
errors.</li>
</ul>
