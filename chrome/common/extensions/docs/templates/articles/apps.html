Legacy packaged apps are discontinued, and Chrome will <strong>stop loading them

This page talks about legacy packaged apps &mdash; how
you implement them,
and how they're different from
extensions and ordinary web apps.
</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>
A legacy packaged app is a web app that's bundled into a <code>.crx</code> file.
In the past, legacy packaged apps could use most of the extension APIs, but
<a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2012/11/restricting-extension-apis-in-legacy.html">
since November 2012</a>, the feature set of legacy packaged apps was reduced.
And in June 2014, discontinuation of legacy packaged apps
<a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2014/06/migrate-your-legacy-packaged-apps-to.html">
was announced</a>; support for them will be removed from Chrome in June 2015.
</p>

<p>
The term "packaged app" used to refer to the "legacy packaged app" as described
in this document, but
<a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2012/08/the-evolution-of-chrome-packaged-apps.html">
since the introduction of Chrome Apps in August 2012</a>, the term "packaged
app" is also used to refer to <a href="../apps/about_apps">Chrome Apps</a>.
Keep this in mind when you read about "packaged apps" in online resources.
</p>

<p>
A close alternative to legacy packaged apps are
<a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome/apps/docs/developers_guide">hosted
apps</a>, which are ordinary web apps with a bit of additional metadata.

<h2 id="manifest">The manifest</h2>

<p>
A packaged app's manifest can have any field
that's available to extensions,
except for "browser_action" and "page_action".
In addition, a packaged app's manifest <b>must</b>
have an "app" field.
Here is a typical manifest for a packaged app:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "My Awesome Racing Game",
  "description": "Enter a world where a Vanagon can beat a Maserati",
  "version": "1",
  <b>"app": {
    "launch": {
      "local_path": "main.html"
    }
  },</b>
  "icons": {
    "16": "icon_16.png",
    "128": "icon_128.png"
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The "app" field has one subfield, "launch",
which specifies the <em>launch page</em> for the app&mdash;the
page (HTML file bundled into the <code>.crx</code> file)
that the browser goes to when the user clicks the app's icon
in the New Tab page.
The "launch" field can contain the following:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>local_path:</dt>
    <dd><em>Required.</em>
    Specifies the launch page
    as a relative path referring to a file
    in the <code>.crx</code> package.
    </dd>
  <dt>container:</dt>
    <dd> The value "panel" makes the app appear
    in an app panel.
    By default, or when you specify "tab",
    the app appears in a tab.

    <!-- PENDING: In the overview
    (or somewhere else before here)
    we should show and define both app panels and tabs.
    We should link to that place from here. -->
    </dd>
  <dt>height:</dt>
    <dd>
    If the container is set to "panel",
    this integer specifies the height
    of the panel in pixels.
    For example, you might specify
    <code>"height":400</code>.
    Note that you don't use quotation marks in the value.
    This field specifies the height of the area
    to display contents in;
    window decorations add a few more pixels to the total height.
    If the container isn't a panel, this field is ignored.
    </dd>
  <dt>width:</dt>
    <dd>
    Similar to "height",
    but specifies the width of the panel.
    </dd>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
Packaged apps usually provide a 16x16 icon
to be used as the favicon for
tabs that contain app's pages.
They also should provide a 128x128 icon,
but not a 48x48 icon.
See the manifest documentation for the
<a href="manifest/icons">"icons" field</a>
for more information.
