<h1>Game Engines</h1>


<p>
Several graphically intense interactive application frameworks / game engines
exist that target web technologies. The following are some we recommend with
instructions for producing a Chrome App.

PlayCanvas is a free and open source WebGL Game Engine targeting mobile and
desktop. Its browser based development tools support real-time collaboration.

PlayCanvas exports content that requires a small amount of manual work to
package into a Chrome App. See:
