<h2 id="code">Implemention of the Chrome Networking Private API</h2>

<p>
The Networking Private API is designed to allow particular apps and
extensions to view and configure the networks available on a device.
</p>

<p>
The API uses <a href=http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/open-network-configuration>
Open Network Configuration</a> to describe network types and properties.
</p>

<p class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The networkingPrivate API is in active development and is primarily supported
on Chrome OS, with a subset supported on Windows and OSX for WiFi configuration.
It is currently only available to allowlisted apps.
