</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>
<p>
  You must declare the "privacy" permission in your extension's
  <a href="manifest">manifest</a> to use the API. For example:
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
  <b>"permissions": [
    "privacy"
  ]</b>,
  ...
}
</pre>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>
  Reading the current value of a Chrome setting is straightforward. You'll first
  need to find the property you're interested in, then you'll call
  <code>get()</code> on that object in order to retrieve its current value and
  your extension's level of control. For example, to determine if Chrome's
  Autofill feature is enabled, you'd write:
</p>

<pre>chrome.privacy.services.autofillEnabled.get({}, function(details) {
  if (details.value)
    console.log('Autofill is on!');
  else
    console.log('Autofill is off!');
});</pre>

<p>
  Changing the value of a setting is a little bit more complex, simply because
  you first must verify that your extension can control the setting. The user
  won't see any change to their settings if your extension toggles a setting
  that is either locked to a specific value by enterprise policies
  (<code>levelOfControl</code> will be set to "not_controllable"), or if another
  extension is controlling the value (<code>levelOfControl</code> will be set to
  "controlled_by_other_extensions"). The <code>set()</code> call will succeed,
  but the setting will be immediately overridden. As this might be confusing, it
  is advisable to warn the user when the settings they've chosen aren't
  practically applied.
</p>

<p class="note">
  Full details about extensions' ability to control <code>ChromeSetting</code>s
  can be found under
  <a href="types#ChromeSetting">
    <code>chrome.types.ChromeSetting</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
  This means that you ought to use the <code>get()</code> method to determine
  your level of access, and then only call <code>set()</code> if your extension
  can grab control over the setting (in fact if your extension can't control the
  setting it's probably a good idea to visually disable the functionality to
  reduce user confusion):
</p>

<pre>chrome.privacy.services.autofillEnabled.get({}, function(details) {
  if (details.levelOfControl === 'controllable_by_this_extension') {
    chrome.privacy.services.autofillEnabled.set({ value: true }, function() {
      if (chrome.runtime.lastError === undefined)
        console.log("Hooray, it worked!");
      else
        console.log("Sadness!", chrome.runtime.lastError);
    });
  }
});</pre>

<p>
  If you're interested in changes to a setting's value, add a listener to its
  <code>onChange</code> event. Among other uses, this will allow you to warn the
  user if a more recently installed extension grabs control of a setting, or if
  enterprise policy overrides your control. To listen for changes to Autofill's
  status, for example, the following code would suffice:
</p>

<pre>chrome.privacy.services.autofillEnabled.onChange.addListener(
    function (details) {
      // The new value is stored in `details.value`, the new level of control
      // in `details.levelOfControl`, and `details.incognitoSpecific` will be
      // `true` if the value is specific to Incognito mode.
    });</pre>
