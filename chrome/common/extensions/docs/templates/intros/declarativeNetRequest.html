<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>
Extensions must declare the <code>"declarativeNetRequest"</code> permission in
the extension <a href="manifest">manifest</a> to use this API. The
<code>"declarativeNetRequestFeedback"</code> permission is required to access
functions and events which return information on declarative rules matched.
<a href="declare_permissions">Host permissions</a> are required if the extension
wants to redirect requests. To specify static
<a href="#type-Ruleset">Rulesets</a>, extensions must also declare the
<code>"declarative_net_request"</code> manifest key, which should be a
dictionary with a single key called <code>"rule_resources"</code>. It should be
a list containing dictionaries of type $(ref:Ruleset), as shown below.
</p>

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
<b>
  "declarative_net_request" : {
    "rule_resources" : [{
      "id": "ruleset_1",
      "enabled": true,
      "path": "rules_1.json"
    }, {
      "id": "ruleset_2",
      "enabled": false,
      "path": "rules_2.json"
    }]
  },
  "permissions": [
    "declarativeNetRequest",
    "declarativeNetRequestFeedback",
    "*://example.com/*"
  ],</b>
  ...
}
</pre>

<h2 id="rule-resources">Rule Resources</h2>

<p>
An extension can specify up to $(ref:MAX_NUMBER_OF_STATIC_RULESETS)
<a href="#type-Ruleset">rulesets</a> as part of the
<code>"rule_resources"</code> manifest key. The number of rules
across <b>enabled</b> static rulesets must be less than the
$(ref:MAX_NUMBER_OF_RULES) constant.
</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<p>
A single declarative $(ref:Rule) consists of four fields: <code>id</code>,
<code>priority</code>, <code>condition</code> and <code>action</code>.
There are the following kinds of rules:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Rules that block a network request.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rules that prevent a request from getting blocked by negating any matching
    blocked rules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rules that redirect a network request.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rules that remove headers from a network request.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>An example rule:</p>
<pre>
{
  "id" : 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action" : { "type" : "block" },
  "condition" : {
    "urlFilter" : "abc",
    "domains" : ["foo.com"],
    "resourceTypes" : ["script"]
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The above rule will block all script requests originating from
<code>"foo.com"</code> to any URL with <code>"abc"</code> as a substring.
</p>

<p>
The <code>urlFilter</code> field of a rule condition is used to specify the
pattern which is matched against the request URL. Some examples of URL filters:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><code><b>urlFilter</b></code></th>
    <th>Matches</th>
    <th>Does not match</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"abc"</code></td>
    <td>
      https://abcd.com<br/>
      https://example.com/abcd
    </td>
    <td>http://ab.com</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"abc*d"</code></td>
    <td>
      https://abcd.com<br/>
      https://example.com/abcxyzd
    </td>
    <td>http://abc.com</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"||a.example.com"</code></td>
    <td>
      https://a.example.com/<br/>
      https://b.a.example.com/xyz
    </td>
    <td>http://example.com/</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"|https*"</code></td>
    <td>https://example.com</td>
    <td>
      http://example.com/<br/>
      http://https.com
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code>"example*^123|"</code></td>
    <td>
      https://example.com/123<br/>
      http://abc.com/example?123
    </td>
    <td>
      https://example.com/1234<br/>
      https://abc.com/example0123
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2 id="dynamic-rules">Dynamic rules</h2>

<p>
To add or remove rules dynamically, extensions can use the
$(ref:updateDynamicRules) API method.

<ul>
<li>
  The number of dynamic rules that an an extension can add is bounded by the
  $(ref:MAX_NUMBER_OF_DYNAMIC_RULES) constant.
</li>
<li>
  The dynamic rules for an extension are persisted across both sessions and
  extension updates.
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<h2 id="updating-enabled-rulesets">Updating enabled rulesets</h2>

<p>
An extension can update the set of enabled static rulesets using the
$(ref:updateEnabledRulesets) API method.

<ul>
  <li>
    The number of rules across enabled static rulesets must be less than the
    $(ref:MAX_NUMBER_OF_RULES) constant.
  </li>
  <li>
    The set of enabled static rulesets is persisted across sessions but not
    across extension updates. The <code>rule_resources</code> manifest key will
    determine the set of enabled static rulesets on initial extension install
    and on each subsequent extension update.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 id="implementation-details">Implementation details</h2>

<h3 id="matching-algorithm">Matching algorithm</h3>

<p>
Before the request is sent, each extension is queried for an action to take.
The following actions are considered at this stage:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Actions which block requests of type <code>block</code></li>
  <li>Actions which redirect requests of type <code>redirect</code> or <code>upgradeScheme</code></li>
  <li>Actions which allow requests of type <code>allow</code> or <code>allowAllRequests</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
If more than one extension returns an action, the extension whose action type
comes first in the list above gets priority. If more than one extension returns
an action with the same priority (position in the list), the most recently
installed extension gets priority.
</p>

<p>
When an extension is queried for how to handle a request, the highest priority
matching static or dynamic rule is returned. If more than one matching rule has
the highest priority, the tie is broken based on the action type, in the
following order of decreasing precedence:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>allow</code></li>
  <li><code>allowAllRequests</code></li>
  <li><code>block</code></li>
  <li><code>upgradeScheme</code></li>
  <li><code>redirect</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
If the request was not blocked or redirected, <code>removeHeaders</code> rules
are evaluated on the request and response headers. All matching
<code>removeHeaders</code> rules from extensions that did not have a matching
<code>allow</code> or <code>allowAllRequests</code> action are evaluated.
</p>

<h3 id="web-request-comparison">
  Comparison with the <a href="webRequest">webRequest</a> API
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    The declarativeNetRequest API allows for evaluating network requests in the
    browser itself. This makes it more performant than the webRequest API, where
    each network request is evaluated in JavaScript in the extension process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Because the requests are not intercepted by the extension process,
    declarativeNetRequest removes the need for extensions to have a background
    page; resulting in less memory consumption.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unlike the webRequest API, blocking requests or removing headers using the
    declarativeNetRequest API requires no host permissions.
  </li>
  <li>
    The declarativeNetRequest API provides better privacy to users because
    extensions can't actually read the network requests made on the user's
    behalf.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unlike the webRequest API, any images or iframes blocked using the
    declarativeNetRequest API are automatically collapsed in the DOM.
  </li>
  <li>
    While deciding whether a request is to be blocked or redirected, the
    declarativeNetRequest API is given priority over the webRequest API because
    it allows for synchronous interception. Similarly, any headers removed
    through declarativeNetRequest API are not made visible to web request
    extensions.
  </li>
  <li>
    The webRequest API is more flexible as compared to the declarativeNetRequest
    API because it allows extensions to evaluate a request programmatically.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Consider a navigation to <code>"http://google.com"</code>. Rules with id
    (1) and (4) match. The request will be blocked because blocking rules have
    higher priority than redirect rules when the <code>"priority"</code> is the
    same.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider a navigation to <code>"http://google.com/1234"</code>. Rules with
    id (1), (2), and (4) match. Because the request has a matching
    <code>allow</code> rule and no higher priority rules, the request is not
    blocked nor redirected and continues to
    <code>"http://google.com/1234"</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider a navigation to <code>"http://google.com/12345"</code> Rules with
    id (1), (2), (3), and (4) match. The request will be blocked because rule
    (3) has the highest priority, overriding all other matching rules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider a navigation to <code>"http://abcd.com"</code>. The rule with id
    (5) matches. Since rule (5) specifies an extension path, the request is
    redirected to <code>"chrome-extension://&lt;extension-id&gt;/a.jpg"</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider a navigation to <code>"http://example.com/path"</code>. The rule
    with id (6) matches. Since rule (6) specifies a url transform, the request
    is redirected to <code>"https://new.example.com/path"</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider a navigation to <code>"http://www.abc.xyz.com/path"</code>. The
    rule with id (7) matches. The request will be redirected to <code>
    "https://abc.xyz.com/path"</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider the following request hierarchy:
      <ul class="compact">
        <li><span class="code-font">https://a.com/path</span> (main-frame request)
          <ul class="compact">

      </ul>
    All requests in green will be allow-listed due to rule with id (8) and not
    be evaluated by the extensions’ ruleset. Requests in red will be blocked due
    to rule with id (9).
  </li>
</ul>
