<h2 id="code">Implemention of the Chrome [OS] Feedback UI</h2>

<p>
The Chrome [OS] Feedback UI is invoked when the user clicks
the Report an Issue button in the wrench->tools menu (wrench
menu if on Chrome OS). This triggers the onFeedbackRequested event
with a feedbackInfo object with the URL of the current page
(determined by the active tab) and if available, the email of the
logged in user filled in. On Chrome OS, the system information field
in the feedbackInfo object may also contain relevent data <i>(for
example, as of now it is populated with a TIMESTAMP key containing
the timestamp of when the user invoked feedback</i>).
</p>

<p>
The UI first takes a screenshot, then displays itself. It uses the
provided API's to get system information and provides the user with
fields to fill out feedback.
</p>

<p>
Once the user is done, the UI uses the sendFeedback API to send the
feedback to the feedback servers.
</p>

<p>
The sendFeedback API gathers the feedback data and starts a post to
the feedback servers. If the post is successful, a 'success' status
is returned to the Feedback UI, otherwise a 'delayed' status is
returned and Chrome continues to try to send the feedback every 4 hours
for up to a day.
</p>


<p class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The feedbackPrivate API can also be used by particular apps to provide
a custom feedback UI and send Chrome Feedback. The productId field in
the feedbackInfo structure can be given to override the product ID to
be sent with the feedback report. This will allow the app to send
feedback to it's own feedback bucket instead of the default Chrome [OS]
one.
