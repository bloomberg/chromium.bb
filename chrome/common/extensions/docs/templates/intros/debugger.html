<h2 id="manifest">Notes</h2>

<p>
As of today, attaching to the tab by means of the debugger API
and using embedded Chrome DevTools with that tab are mutually exclusive.
If user invokes Chrome DevTools while extension is attached to the tab,
debugging session is terminated. Extension can re-establish it later.
</p>

<h2 id="manifest">Manifest</h2>

<p>
You must declare the "debugger" permission in your extension's manifest
to use this API.

<pre data-filename="manifest.json">
{
  "name": "My extension",
  ...
<b>  "permissions": [
    "debugger",
  ]</b>,
  ...
}
</pre>
