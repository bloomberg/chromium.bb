"""Performance test for the HTML5 media tag.

This PyAuto powered script plays media (video or audio) files using the HTML5
tag embedded in an HTML file (specified in the GetPlayerHTMLFileName() method)
and measures decoder's side frames per second (FPS), which is generated by the
HTML file. The parameters needed to run this test are passed in the form of
environment variables (such as the number of runs). media_perf_runner.py
is used for generating these variables (PyAuto does not support direct
parameters).
