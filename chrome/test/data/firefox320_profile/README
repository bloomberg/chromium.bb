This directory is created to hold test data for Firefox importer browser tests.

Since Firefox 32.0, instead of signons.sqlite, all passwords are stored in
logins.json. The test data in this directory is intended for Firefox 32.0 and
later.

All other files are grabbed from
/src/chrome/test/data/firefox_profile because the format and content for those
data have not changed.
