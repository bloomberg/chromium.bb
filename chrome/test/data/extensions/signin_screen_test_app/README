The CRX file must be a one signed by WebStore, in order for the app to have the
expected ID which is whitelisted in Chrome - "bjaiihebfngildkcjkjckolinodhliff".

This app will also be used for the manual testing of the apps on the Chrome OS
sign-in screen.

In case a new version of the test app has to be published on WebStore, please
reach out to the managed-devices@ mailing list.
