The whitelisted_extension.crx package must be signed by WebStore, in order for
the extension to have the expected ID which is whitelisted in Chrome:
"oclffehlkdgibkainkilopaalpdobkan".

The not_whitelisted_extension.crx can be packed using the private key
./not_whitelisted_extension.pem. For the instructions, refer to:
<https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging#creating>.

These extensions are used in the API tests and browser tests for the
chrome.loginScreenUi API. The code for the tests can be found under the
chrome/browser/chromeos/extensions/login_screen_ui/ directory.

In case a new version of the test extension has to be published on WebStore,
please reach out to the managed-devices@ mailing list.
