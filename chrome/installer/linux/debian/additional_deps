# We'd like to eliminate more of these deps by relying on the 'lsb' package, but
# that brings in tons of unnecessary stuff, like an mta and rpm. Until that full
# 'lsb' package is installed by default on DEB distros, we'll have to stick with
# the LSB sub-packages, to avoid pulling in all that stuff that's not installed
# by default.
#
# ca-certificates: Make sure users have SSL certificates.
# fonts-liberation: Make sure users have compatible fonts for viewing PDFs.
# libappindicator1: Make systray icons work in Unity.
# libnss3: Pull a more recent version of NSS than required by runtime linking,
#          for security and stability updates in NSS.
# lsb-release: For lsb_release.
# xdg-utils: For OS integration.
# wget: For uploading crash reports with Breakpad.
