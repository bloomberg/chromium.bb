# Additional dependencies not in the rpm find-requires output.
#
# TODO(thestig,bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1482760): Use the
# liberation-fonts package once it's available on all distros.
#
# /usr/bin/lsb_release: For lsb_release.
# ca-certificates: Make sure users have SSL certificates.
# liberation-*-fonts: Make sure users have compatible fonts for viewing PDFs.
# libnss3 and libssl3: Specify a more recent version for security and
#   stability updates. While we depend on libnss3.so and not
#   libssl3.so, force the dependency on libssl3 to ensure the NSS
#   version is 3.28 or later, since libssl3 should always be packaged
#   with libnss3.
# wget: For uploading crash reports with Breakpad.
# xdg-utils: For OS integration.
