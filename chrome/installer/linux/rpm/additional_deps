# lsb implies many dependencies and on Fedora or RHEL some of these are not
# needed at all (the most obvious one is qt3) and Chrome is usually the one
# who pulls them to the system by requiring the whole lsb. Require only
# lsb_release from the lsb as that's the only thing that we are using.
#
# nss (bundled) is optional in LSB 4.0. Also specify a more recent version
# for security and stability updates. While we depend on libnss3.so and not
# libssl3.so, force the dependency on libssl3 to ensure the NSS version is
# 3.28 or later, since libssl3 should always be packaged with libnss3.
#
# wget is for uploading crash reports with Breakpad.
#
# xdg-utils is still optional in LSB 4.0.
#
# zlib may not need to be there. It should be included with LSB.
# TODO(thestig): Figure out why there is an entry for zlib.
#
# We want to depend on the system SSL certs so wget can upload crash reports
# securely, but there's no common capability between the distros. Bugs filed:

# https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=538158

#
# We want to depend on liberation-fonts as well, but there is no such package
# for Fedora. https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1252564
# TODO(thestig): Use the liberation-fonts package once its available on all
# supported distros.
