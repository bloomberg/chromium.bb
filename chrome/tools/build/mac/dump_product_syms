# This script expects the following environment variables to be set.  Xcode
# normally sets them:
#
# CONFIGURATION - Release or Debug; this script only operates when Release.
# SRCROOT - /path/to/chrome/src/chrome
# BUILT_PRODUTS_DIR - /path/to/chrome/src/xcodebuild/Release
#
# The script also takes a single argument defining the branding type.
#
# To test this script without running an entire build:
#
# cd /path/to/chrome/src/chrome
# CONFIGURATION=Release \
#     SRCROOT=$(pwd) \
#     BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR=$(pwd)/../xcodebuild/Release \
#     tools/build/mac/dump_app_syms Chromium

# Make sure we got the header to write into passed to us

# Skip out if we're aren't in Release mode, no need for dump_syms on debug runs.
