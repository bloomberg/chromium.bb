# This script builds the credential provider installer that is used to install
# all required components of the Google Credential Provider for Windows.  The
# installer is a 7-zip self extracting executable file that wraps three main
# parts:
#
#  - the Credential Provider COM DLL
#  - a DLL that contains Windows EventLog message formatting
#  - a setup exe that performs action required during install and uninstall
#
# In this description "installer" refers to the self extracting executable that
# wraps all the parts, whereas "setup" refers to an exe inside the installer
# that runs specific actions at install and uninstall time.
#
# When run, the installer extracts the wrapped files into a new empty
# directory under %TEMP%.  The setup exe is then run to register the COM
# objects, install the message format dll, and properly register the credential
# provider with Windows.  Once installation completes, the new directory
# containing the extracted files is automatically deleted.
#
# The installer can be run multiple times on the same machine.  On an already
# working computer this is essentially a noop.  On a damaged computer the files
# will be overwritten and the parts registered, so can be used to correct
# problems.
#
# Running a new version of the installer will replace the existing install with
# a newer one.  It is not required to first uninstall the old version.
# Installation of the newer version will attempt to delete older versions if
# possible.
#
# The installer is not needed for uninstall and may be removed after initial
# install.  To uninstall the Google Credential Provider for Windows, run the
# setup exe with the command line argument: /uninstall
