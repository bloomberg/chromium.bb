     *       response completes, append the content below any content seen by the user, removing the
     *       old content below that level.
     *   <li>REQUEST_WITH_TIMEOUT - Make a request and if the response takes longer than the
     *       configured timeout, show existing content. When the response completes, the new content
     *       will be displayed below any content the user has viewed.
     *   <li>NO_REQUEST_WITH_WAIT - Show the current content, if an existing request is being made,
     *       wait for it to complete.
     *   <li>NO_REQUEST_WITH_CONTENT - Show the existing content, don't wait if a request is
     * currently being made. <li>NO_REQUEST_WITH_TIMEOUT - Show the current content. If an existing
     * request is being made, wait for the configured timeout for it to complete. When the response
     * completes, the new content will be displayed below any content the user has viewed.
