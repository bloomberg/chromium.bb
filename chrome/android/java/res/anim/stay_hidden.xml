<!-- The delay here must be long enough for the Activity being resumed to draw
     its first frame of UI. This is to avoid showing stale 2D screenshots when
     launching Chrome in VR. Note that the larger this value is, the more
     latency we add to resuming Chrome after going through the Daydream Device
     ON flow. -->
