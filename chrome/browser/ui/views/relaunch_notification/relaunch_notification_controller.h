// A class that observes changes to the browser.relaunch_notification
// preference (which is backed by the RelaunchNotification policy
// setting) and upgrade notifications from the UpgradeDetector. The two
// values for the RelaunchNotification policy setting are handled as follows:
//
// On Chrome desktop:
// - Recommended (1): The controller displays the relaunch recommended bubble on
//   each change to the UpgradeDetector's upgrade_notification_stage (an
//   "annoyance level" of low, elevated, or high). Once the high annoyance level
//   is reached, the controller continually reshows a the bubble on a timer with
//   a period equal to the time delta between the "elevated" and "high"
//   showings.
//
// - Required (2): The controller displays the relaunch required dialog on each
//   change to the UpgradeDetector's upgrade_notification_stage (described
//   above). The browser is relaunched one hour after the third and final
//   showing of the dialog (which takes place when the UpgradeDetector reaches
//   the high annoyance level).
//
// On Chrome OS both notifications (recommended and required, described above)
// are shown in the unified system tray, overwriting the default "update
// available" notification. It cannot be deferred, so it persists until reboot.
