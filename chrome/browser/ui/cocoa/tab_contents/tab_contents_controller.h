// view (the NSView accessed by calling |-view|) which manages the layout and

// Client code that inserts [controller view] into the view hierarchy needs to
// call -ensureContentsVisibleInSuperview:(NSView*)superview to match the
// container to the [superview bounds] and avoid multiple resize messages being
// sent to the renderer, which triggers redundant and costly layouts.
//
// AutoEmbedFullscreen mode: When enabled, TabContentsController will observe
// for WebContents fullscreen changes and automatically swap the normal
// WebContents view with the fullscreen view (if different). In addition, if a
// WebContents is being screen-captured, the view will be centered within the
// container view, sized to the aspect ratio of the capture video resolution,
// and scaling will be avoided whenever possible.
