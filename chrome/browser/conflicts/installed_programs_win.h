class MsiUtil;

// This class inspects the user's installed programs and builds a mapping of
// files to its associated program.
//
// Installed programs are found by searching the
// "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall" registry key and
// its variants. There are 2 cases that are covered:
//
// 1 - If the program's installer did its due dilligence, it populated the
//     "InstallLocation" registry key with the directory where it was installed,
//     and all the files under that directory are assumed to be owned by this
//     program.
//
//     In the event of 2 conflicting "InstallLocation", both are ignored as this
//     method doesn't let us know for sure who is the owner of any enclosing
//     files.
//
// 2 - If the program's entry is a valid MSI Product GUID, the complete list of
//     associated file is used to exactly match a given file to a program.
//
//     If multiple products installed the same file as the same component,
//     Windows keeps a reference count of that component so that the file
//     doesn't get removed if one of them is uninstalled. So both programs are
//     returned by GetInstalledPrograms().
//
//  Note: Programs may be skipped and so would not be returned by
//        GetInstalledPrograms() for the following reasons:
//        - The program is owned by Microsoft.
//        - The uninstall entry is marked as a system component.
//        - The uninstall entry has no display name.
//        - The uninstall entry has no UninstallString.
//
// This class is not thread safe and should be only accessed on the same
// sequence.
