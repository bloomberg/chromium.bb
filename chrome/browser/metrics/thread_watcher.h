// This file defines a WatchDog thread that monitors the responsiveness of other
// browser threads like UI, IO, DB, FILE and CACHED threads. It also defines
// ThreadWatcher class which performs health check on threads that would like to
// be watched. This file also defines ThreadWatcherList class that has list of
// all active ThreadWatcher objects.
//
// ThreadWatcher class sends ping message to the watched thread and the watched
// thread responds back with a pong message. It uploads response time
// (difference between ping and pong times) as a histogram.
//
// TODO(raman): ThreadWatcher can detect hung threads. If a hung thread is
// detected, we should probably just crash, and allow the crash system to gather
// then stack trace.
//
// Example Usage:
//
//   The following is an example for watching responsiveness of watched (IO)
//   thread. |sleep_time| specifies how often ping messages have to be sent to
//   watched (IO) thread. |unresponsive_time| is the wait time after ping
//   message is sent, to check if we have received pong message or not.
//   |unresponsive_threshold| specifies the number of unanswered ping messages
//   after which watched (IO) thread is considered as not responsive.
//   |crash_on_hang| specifies if we want to crash the browser when the watched
//   (IO) thread has become sufficiently unresponsive, while other threads are
//   sufficiently responsive. |live_threads_threshold| specifies the number of
//   browser threads that are to be responsive when we want to crash the browser
//   because of hung watched (IO) thread.
//
//   base::TimeDelta sleep_time = base::TimeDelta::FromSeconds(5);
//   base::TimeDelta unresponsive_time = base::TimeDelta::FromSeconds(10);
//   uint32_t unresponsive_threshold = ThreadWatcherList::kUnresponsiveCount;
//   bool crash_on_hang = false;
//   uint32_t live_threads_threshold = ThreadWatcherList::kLiveThreadsThreshold;
//   ThreadWatcher::StartWatching(
//       BrowserThread::IO, "IO", sleep_time, unresponsive_time,
//       unresponsive_threshold, crash_on_hang, live_threads_threshold);

  // |live_threads_threshold| specifies the maximum number of browser threads
  // that have to be responsive when we want to crash the browser because of
  // hung watched thread. This threshold allows us to either look for a system
  // deadlock, or look for a solo hung thread. A small live_threads_threshold
  // looks for a broad deadlock (few browser threads left running), and a large
  // threshold looks for a single hung thread (this in only appropriate for a
  // thread that *should* never have much jank, such as the IO).
  //
  // |unresponsive_threshold| specifies the number of unanswered ping messages
  // after which watched (UI, IO, etc) thread is considered as not responsive.
  // We translate "time" (given in seconds) into a number of pings. As a result,
  // we only declare a thread unresponsive when a lot of "time" has passed (many
  // pings), and yet our pinging thread has continued to process messages (so we
  // know the entire PC is not hung). Set this number higher to crash less
  // often, and lower to crash more often.
  //
  // The map lists all threads (by name) that can induce a crash by hanging. It
  // is populated from the command line, or given a default list.  See
  // InitializeAndStartWatching() for the separate list of all threads that are
  // watched, as they provide the system context of how hung *other* threads
  // are.
  //
  // ThreadWatcher monitors five browser threads (i.e., UI, IO, DB, FILE,
  // and CACHE). Out of the 5 threads, any subset may be watched, to potentially
  // cause a crash. The following example's command line causes exactly 3
  // threads to be watched.
  //
  // The example command line argument consists of "UI:3:18,IO:3:18,FILE:5:90".
  // In that string, the first parameter specifies the thread_id: UI, IO or
  // FILE. The second parameter specifies |live_threads_threshold|. For UI and
  // IO threads, we would crash if the number of threads responding is less than
  // or equal to 3. The third parameter specifies the unresponsive threshold
  // seconds. This number is used to calculate |unresponsive_threshold|. In this
  // example for UI and IO threads, we would crash if those threads don't
  // respond for 18 seconds (or 9 unanswered ping messages) and for FILE thread,
  // crash_seconds is set to 90 seconds (or 45 unanswered ping messages).
  //
  // The following examples explain how the data in |CrashDataThresholds|
  // controls the crashes.
  //
  // Example 1: If the |live_threads_threshold| value for "IO" was 3 and
  // unresponsive threshold seconds is 18 (or |unresponsive_threshold| is 9),
  // then we would crash if the IO thread was hung (9 unanswered ping messages)
  // and if at least one thread is responding and total responding threads is
  // less than or equal to 3 (this thread, plus at least one other thread is
  // unresponsive). We would not crash if none of the threads are responding, as
  // we'd assume such large hang counts mean that the system is generally
  // unresponsive.
  // Example 2: If the |live_threads_threshold| value for "UI" was any number
  // higher than 6 and unresponsive threshold seconds is 18 (or
  // |unresponsive_threshold| is 9), then we would always crash if the UI thread
  // was hung (9 unanswered ping messages), no matter what the other threads are
  // doing.
  // Example 3: If the |live_threads_threshold| value of "FILE" was 5 and
  // unresponsive threshold seconds is 90 (or |unresponsive_threshold| is 45),
  // then we would only crash if the FILE thread was the ONLY hung thread
  // (because we watch 6 threads). If there was another unresponsive thread, we
  // would not consider this a problem worth crashing for. FILE thread would be
  // considered as hung if it didn't respond for 45 ping messages.
