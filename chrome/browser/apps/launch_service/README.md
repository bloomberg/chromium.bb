The Launch Service provides browser-specific functions for launching
application.

For example, Chrome Apps (platform apps and legacy packaged apps),
and BMO-based Desktop PWAs can be launched using this service.

The intent is to merge LaunchService into the AppService,
specifically AppServiceProxy.

See `//chrome/services/app_service/README.md` for a description of the
App Service.
