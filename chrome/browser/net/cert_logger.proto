// This protobuffer is intended to store reports from Chrome users of
// certificate pinning errors. A report will be sent from Chrome when it gets
// e.g. a certificate for google.com that chains up to a root CA not expected by
// Chrome for that origin, such as DigiNotar (compromised in July 2011), or
// other pinning errors such as a blacklisted cert in the chain. The
// report from the user will include the hostname being accessed, 
// the full certificate chain (in PEM format), and the
// timestamp of when the client tried to access the site. A response is
// generated by the frontend and logged, including validation and error checking
// done on the client's input data.
