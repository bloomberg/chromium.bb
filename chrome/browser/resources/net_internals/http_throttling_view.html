  In order to prevent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks from
  being perpetrated by web pages and extensions that run within Chrome, the
  HTTP throttling mechanism keeps track of errors requesting a given URL
  (minus the query parameters), and after a few 5xx errors in a row, starts
  exponentially increasing an interval during which requests to the
  given URL are disallowed.
