  UI for the MultiDevice setup flow when displayed after OOBE or during the
  user's first login on this Chromebook. Note that this flow is
  slightly different from the post-login flow in 3 ways:
    (1) In the first run, the user has just entered their password, so we do not
        prompt the user to enter a password before continuing.
    (2) In the first run, once the user selects a host device, we continue to
        the next OOBE/login task; in the post-login mode, there is a "success"
        screen.
    (3) In the first run, buttons are styled with custom OOBE buttons.

  TODO(khorimoto): Implement real flow. For now, this page simply displays
                   placeholder buttons. See https://crbug.com/884065.

  Example:
      <multidevice-setup-first-run></multidevice-setup-first-run>
-->
<dom-module id="multidevice-setup-first-run">
  <template>
    <div>Placeholder MultiDevice setup flow</div>
    <oobe-text-button inverse on-click="onSkipSetupClicked_">
      <div>Skip setup</div>
    </oobe-text-button>
    <oobe-next-button on-click="onAcceptClicked_">
      <div>Next</div>
    </oobe-next-button>
  </template>
</dom-module>
