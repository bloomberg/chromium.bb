# The chrome/browser/api directory is for programming interfaces
# provided by Chrome to Browser Components that run within Chrome.
# Files here are not allowed to include stuff under chrome/browser
# since that would leak implementation details to users of the APIs.
#
# APIs can be either pure-virtual to allow specialization at runtime,
# or they can be non-virtual and specialized per platform (or
# otherwise at compile time), or a mix of non-virtual and virtual.
# The primary initial objective is to break Browser Components'
# dependencies on implementation details, so non-virtual classes in
# header files that do not expose any headers from chrome/browser
# except for chrome/browser/api are acceptable.
#
# Note that for non-virtual APIs, there is an increased risk of an
# implicit link-time dependency remaining from the user of the API to
# the implementation.  We are accepting this risk initially, but plan
# to write a new type of link-time or target-level set of dependency
# rules to help us find such problems and reduce them over time.
#
# The directory structure under chrome/browser/api/ is a mirror of
# those parts of the chrome/browser/ structure that APIs have been
# extracted from.  Hence, an API defined in chrome/browser/api/x/y/z
# is likely to be implemented in a directory chrome/browser/x/y/z.
