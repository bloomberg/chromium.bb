  // this current sync cycle won't be available from GetLastCycleSnapshot()
  // until the sync cycle completes.  If we query this condition between the
  // commit response processing and the end of the sync cycle, we could return a
  // false positive.
  //
  // In practice, this doesn't happen very often because we only query the
  // status when the waiting first starts and when we receive notification of a
  // sync session complete or other significant event from the
  // ProfileSyncService.  If we're calling this right after the sync session
  // completes, then the snapshot is much more likely to be up to date.
