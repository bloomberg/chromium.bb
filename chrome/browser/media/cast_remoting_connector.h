// CastRemotingConnector connects a single source (a media element in a render
// frame) with a single sink (a media player in a remote device). There is one
// instance of a CastRemotingConnector per source WebContents (representing a
// collection of render frames), and it is created on-demand. The source in the
// render process represents itself by providing a media::mojom::RemotingSource
// service instance. The sink is represented by the Media Router Cast Provider.
//
// Whenever a candidate media source is created in a render frame,
// ChromeContentBrowserClient will call CreateMediaRemoter() to instantiate a
// media::mojom::Remoter associated with the connector. A corresponding
// media::mojom::RemotingSource is provided by the caller for communications
// back to the media source in the render frame: The connector uses this to
// notify when a sink becomes available for remoting, and to pass binary
// messages from the sink back to the source.
//
// At any time before or after the CastRemotingConnector is created, the
// Media Router Cast Provider may create a tab remoting media route. This
// indicates that the provider has found a sink that is capable of remoting and
// is available for use. At this point, CastRemotingConnector notifies all
// RemotingSources that a sink is available, and some time later a
// RemotingSource can request the start of a remoting session. Once the sink is
// no longer available, the provider terminates the route and
// CastRemotingConnector notifies all RemotingSources that the sink is gone.
//
// Note that only one RemotingSource can remote media at a time. Therefore,
// CastRemotingConnector must mediate among simultaneous requests for media
// remoting, and only allow one at a time. Currently, the policy is "first come,
// first served."
//
// When starting a remoting session, the CastRemotingConnector sends control
// messages to the Cast Provider. These control messages direct the provider to
// start/stop remoting with the remote device (e.g., launching apps or services
// on the remote device). Among its other duties, the provider will also set up
// a Cast Streaming session to provide a bitstream transport for the media. Once
// this is done, the provider sends notification messages back to
// CastRemotingConnector to acknowledge this. Then, CastRemotingConnector knows
// it can look-up and pass the mojo data pipe handles to CastRemotingSenders,
// and the remoting session will be fully active. The CastRemotingConnector is
// responsible for passing small binary messages between the source and sink,
// while the CastRemotingSender handles the high-volume media data transfer.
//
// Please see the unit tests in cast_remoting_connector_unittest.cc as a
// reference for how CastRemotingConnector and a Cast Provider interact to
// start/execute/stop remoting sessions.
