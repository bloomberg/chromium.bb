//
// This class must be bound to a given Sequence and all access to it must
// occur on that Sequence. In practice, this is intended to be on the UI
// thread as the notifications of interest occur natively on that thread. All
// calculations are very short and quick, so it is suitable for use on that
// thread.
//
// This class is intended to be created in early startup and persists as a
// singleton in the browser process, owned by the TabManager. It is deliberately
// leaked at shutdown.
//
// This class isn't directly an observer of anything. An external source must
// invoke the callbacks in the protected section of the class. In the case of
// the TabManager this is done by a combination of the
// ResourceCoordinatorWebContentsObserver and the
// TabManagerResourceCoordinatorSignalObserver.

    // loading, and will only transition to loading once the throttle has been
    // removed.
