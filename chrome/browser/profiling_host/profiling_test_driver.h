// does support content_browsertests, but those are not multi-process tests. On
// Android, processes have to be started via the Activity mechanism, and the
// test infrastructure does not support this.
//
// To avoid test-code duplication, all tests are pulled into this class.
// browser_tests will directly call this class. The android
// chrome_public_test_apk will invoke this class via a JNI shim. Since the
// latter is not running within the gtest framework, this class cannot use
// EXPECT* and ASSERT* macros. Instead, this class will return a bool indicating
// success of the entire test. On failure, errors will be output via LOG(ERROR).
// These will show up in the browser_tests output stream, and will be captured
// by logcat [the Android logging facility]. The latter is already the canonical
// mechanism for investigating test failures.
//
// Note: Outputting to stderr will not have the desired effect, since that is
// not captured by logcat.
