This directory stores files related to Chrome's reputation warnings.

If Chrome believes a site a user is visiting is low reputation, either due to
failing heuristics or models in Chrome, or as determined server-side, Chrome may
warn users about this state. This warning may either be a full-page interstitial
warning or a pop-up while visiting the page.

This warning will not trigger on sites that are not likely to be actively
malicious, such as popular sites or sites with high engagement scores.
