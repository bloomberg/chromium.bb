// stored user preferences (assumed to have been edited only by Chromiums
// past and present) and the like. External means that the set of apps to
// install is defined dynamically, depending on 'third party' data that can
// change from session to session even if those sessions are for the same
// user running the same binary on the same hardware.

// directories on the file system, entries (or the lack of) in the Windows
// registry, or centrally configured sys-admin policy.

// install sources, the code that installs apps based on those external data
// sources can also need to *un*install apps if those external data sources
// change, either by an explicit uninstall request or an implicit uninstall
// of a previously-listed no-longer-listed app.
