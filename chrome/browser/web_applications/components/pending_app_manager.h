  // install is defined dynamically, depending on 'third party' data that can
  // change from session to session even if those sessions are for the same
  // user running the same binary on the same hardware.

  // Third party data sources can include configuration files in well known

  // install sources, the code that installs apps based on those external data

  // of a previously-listed no-longer-listed app.

  // that manages external-xxx apps might inadvertently uninstall internal apps
