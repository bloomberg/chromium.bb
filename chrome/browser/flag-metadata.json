// This file lists metadata for chrome://flags entries. This metadata is not
// ever used in the built browser or in any compiled code, but is used as part
// of the review process and to clean up flags that have become obsolete or
// unused.
//
// This file is a list of json objects; each object contains these keys:
//
//   name: the internal name of the flag, as present in chrome://flags. This is
//   used as a primary key. The value is a string.
//
//   owners: the person(s) or team(s) responsible for this flag. The value is a
//   list of strings, each of which is either an email address, or any other
//   text, in which case it is assumed to be the username part of an
//   @chromium.org email address.
//
//   expiry_milestone: the milestone after which this flag is obsolete.
//   Specifically, after the milestone with the given number branches, this flag
//   may freely be deleted and defaulted to either enabled or disabled where
//   used. The special value -1 means "never expires", which should only be used
//   in consultation with top-level OWNERS.
