"""
The Value hierarchy provides a way of representing the values measurements
produce such that they can be merged across runs, grouped by page, and output
to different targets.

The core Value concept provides the basic functionality:
- association with a page, may be none
- naming and units
- importance tracking [whether a value will show up on a waterfall or output
  file by default]
- other metadata, such as a description of what was measured
- default conversion to scalar and string
- merging properties

A page may actually run a few times during a single telemetry session.
Downstream consumers of test results typically want to group these runs
together, then compute summary statistics across runs. Value provides the
Merge* family of methods for this kind of aggregation.
