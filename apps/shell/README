# Introduction

app_shell is an experimental project to build a minimal environment like
content_shell.

The goal is to be able to run a v2 app and supply most of the chrome.* extension
APIs without running the rest of Chrome.

app_shell is only officially supported on Chrome OS.

# How to run

app_shell --app=/path/to/extension
