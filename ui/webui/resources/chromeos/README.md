This directory contains shared chromeos elements for Web UI
(e.g. between Settings and a stand alone dialog).

These components are allowed to use I18nBehavior. The Web UI hosting
these elements is expected to provide loadTimeData with the necessary
strings. TODO(stevenjb/dschuyler): Add support for i18n{} substitution.
