// FocusRing is a View that is designed to act as an indicator of focus for its
// parent. It is a stand-alone view that paints to a layer which extends beyond
// the bounds of its parent view.
//
// Using FocusRing looks something like this:
//
//   class MyView : public View {
//     ...
//    private:
//     std::unique_ptr<FocusRing> focus_ring_;
//   };
//
//   MyView::MyView() {
//     focus_ring_ = FocusRing::Install(this);
//     ...
//   }
//
// If MyView should show a rounded rectangular focus ring when it has focus and
// hide the ring when it loses focus, no other configuration is necessary. In
// other cases, it might be necessary to use the Set*() functions on FocusRing;
// these take care of repainting it when the state changes.
