// Interface for platform-specific output of media.
// A new MediaPipelineBackend will be instantiated for each media player
// instance and raw audio stream.  If a backend has both video and audio
// decoders, they must be synchronized.
// If more backends are requested than the platform supports, the unsupported
// extra backends may return nullptr for CreateAudioDecoder/CreateVideoDecoder.
// The basic usage pattern is:
//   * Decoder objects created and delegates set, then Initialize called
//   * Start/Stop/Pause/Resume used to manage playback state
//   * Decoder objects are used to pass actual stream data buffers
//   * Backend must make appropriate callbacks on the provided Delegate
// All functions will be called on the media thread.  Delegate callbacks
// must be made on this thread also (using provided TaskRunner if necessary).
