     * be iterated, and O(n) memory needs to be allocated out-of-place to store the stack. However,
     * for small, simple tasks, like iterating an ObserverList in reverse, this is a useful way to
     * concisely iterate a container in reverse order in a for-each loop.
     *
     * Example:
     *
     *      List<String> lines = ...;
     *      // Prints lines in reverse order that they were added to the list.
     *      for (String line : Itertools.reverse(lines)) {
     *          Log.i(TAG, line);
