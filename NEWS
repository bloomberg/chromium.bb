liblouis NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.?.? (????-??-??)

** New features
   - Estonian grade 0, thanks to Jürgen Dengo.
   - Portuguese 8 dot Computer braille, Thanks to Rui Fontes
*** Improvements to the python bindings
    All constants defined in liblouis.h are now exposed in the bindings.
*** Add a doctest infrastructure
    These tests are based on the Python doctest framework and are only
    run if there is a Python interpreter on the system
*** Add a test harness
    This test infrastructure allows the user to do table tests in a
    simple and concise syntax. These test are also based on Python and
    are only run if Python is installed on the system. See the
    documentation for more information.

** Improved the documentation
   - Document the test harness

** Bug fixes
   - lou_allround and lou_translate now properly handle unicode
     characters

** Braille Table Improvements
   - Added:
     latinLetterDef6Dots.uti, latinLetterDef8Dots.uti,
     loweredDigits6Dots.uti, loweredDigits8Dots.uti,
     digits6Dots.uti, digits6DotsPlusDot6.uti, digits8Dots.uti
     to better make use of table include infrastructure.
     This removes duplication in tables, and should make it easier to define tables, since instead of defining individual 
     characters, the table producer can simply include the right class of definitions.
   - Most tables were touched by the deduplication tables mensioned above.

      using the outlenMultiplier module variable. The default will
      handle the case where every input character is undefined in the
      translation table. Previously, this was hard-coded to 2, which

      (issue 11)

*** Python bindings
    - Remove unnecessary imports, allowing the bindings to run in Python

      reported by the Debian packaging builder
