* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.3 (2013-??-??)

** New features
*** New Braille tables
    - Korean grade 1 and grade 2 thanks to Joseph Lee
    - U.K. English 8 dot computer braille table thanks to David
      Reynolds
    - New Russian literary and computer braille tables thanks to Igor
      B. Poretsky. These replace the older Russian tables which are
      left for backwards compatibility.
    - New hyphenation dictionary for Russian thanks to Igor B.
      Poretsky.

** Braille Table Improvements
   - da-dk-g2.ctb, mostly rewritten to use nocross and hyphenation table.
   - Most tables: removed the default collapse whitespace statements, if you need to compress 
     whitespace, consider adding compress.ctb to the list of tables when processing.
   - Corrections to Unified English Braille Code (Grade 2), thanks to
     Joseph Lee
   - Corrections to apostrophes in the Computer Spanish 8 dots Braille
     table (Es-Es-G0.utb). Thanks to Juan C. Buno.
   - Corrections for double angle quotation marks and emphasis marks
     in the Norwegian Grade 0 Braille Table. Thanks to Knut Arne
     Bjørndal.
   - Corrections to the Italian table thanks to Igor B. Poretsky.
   - Corrections to the Hungarian grade 1 table thanks to Hammer
     Attila
   - Corrections to English, U.S. Grade 2 (ABAE) table. Thanks to Ken
     Perry for reporting the bug and John J. Boyer for fixing it.
   - Further reorganization of the tables to remove
     duplication. Move litdigit opcode common parts and include where needed.
   - Removed obsolete en-us-g1.utb, which has been replaced by en-us-g1.ctb.

** Bug Fixes
   - Cursor position calculation is now based on the same code that
     calculates inpos and outpos. This probably solves a number of
     bugs.
   - Fixed nocross opcode processing.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.2 (2012-12-18)

While initially planned as mainly a bug fix release this release
contains some notable new features: There is a new tool to trace which
rules have been used to perform a translation. Also along with other
new tables the long awaited table for UEB is finally here.

** New features
*** New tool to trace rule application
    There is a new tool (lou_trace) which helps to trace which rules
    have been used to perform a Braille translation. This is helpful
    for writing Braille tables. See the documentation for more
    information.
*** New Braille tables
    - Inuktitut grade 1, thanks to Greg Kearney.
    - UEB grade 1 and 2, thanks to Joseph Lee. These tables replace
      the old UEB tables (UEBC-g1.utb and UEBC-g2.ctb).
    - Korean table thanks to Joseph Lee

** Braille Table Improvements
   - da-dk-g2.ctb, fixes for transposed â, å, æ, ä, ø  and ö,
     corrected/improved harness tests.
   - Corrections for en-GB-g2.ctb thanks to Paul Wood
   - Corrections to the Hungarian grade 1 table thanks to Hammer
     Attila

** Bug Fixes
   - Update gnulib
   - Fix a bug in the correct opcode which causes sometimes random
     results when translating. Thanks to Bert Frees.
   - Fixes for compiler warnings.
   - Fix some Valgrind warnings about invalid reads
 
* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.1 (2012-9-24)

** Braille Table Improvements
- Fix encoding problem in italian table and added more character
  definitions. Thanks to Simone Dal Maso <simone.dalmaso@juvox.it>.
- Rename it-it-g1.utb to it-it-comp6.utb and it-it-g1.utb2 to
  it-it-comp8.utb.

** Bug fixes
- Fix outputPos and inlen where an input character generates multiple
  output characters.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.0 (2012-9-10)

This release contains a tremendous amount of work many developers.
Many long standing bugs have been fixed. The tables can finally be in
UTF-8. A grand table cleanup removed duplication from the tables.
There are now two extensive test frameworks for table writers. A
number of new tables have been contributed on top of the usual
assortment of table improvements. Thanks to all of this liblouis has
already seen quite a bit of uptake in a number of places, notably the
new DAISY pipeline will ship with this release of liblouis.

NOTE: If you have private tables you might want to migrate them to
utf-8. To do this just use iconv as follows:

  $ iconv -f latin-1 -t utf-8 <input >output

** New features
*** New Braille tables
    - Estonian grade 0, thanks to Jürgen Dengo.
    - Portuguese 8 dot Computer braille, Thanks to Rui Fontes
*** UTF-8 support in tables
    Braille tables can now contain UTF-8 in the opcode arguments.
*** Improvements to the python bindings
    All constants defined in liblouis.h are now exposed in the bindings.
*** Add a doctest infrastructure
    These tests are based on the Python doctest framework and are only
    run if there is a Python interpreter on the system
*** Add a test harness
    This test infrastructure allows the user to do table tests in a
    simple and concise syntax. These tests are based on the Python
    nose testing framework and are only run if either Python 2.x or
    3.x with the related nose python module is installed on the
    system. See the documentation for more information. Thanks to
    Mesar Hameed.
*** Add a test harness generator
    A harness generator that uses simple text files with a little
    formatting to help to generate the json harness files. The purpose
    of this tool is to make it much easier and faster to add checks
    for a given table. You are expected to read the generated harness
    file and make necessary changes, the tool only helps you to get
    the tests into the harness format, not check their validity.
*** Support for Python 3 in the Python bindings
    The Python bindings now work for both Python 2 and Python 3.
    Thanks to Michael Whapples.

** Improved C-based test framework
   - Improved the test framework to be able to test translations
     involving Unicode.
   - Added numerous tests, e.g. for lowercase and Unicode, for the
     input position, for repeated, etc.

** Improved the documentation
   - Document the test harness (json format, fields, flags).
   - Document the use of Valgrind to find memory leaks
   - Improve the documentation on the display opcode

** Bug fixes
   - lou_allround and lou_translate now properly handle Unicode
     characters
   - Fix some issues reported by Valgrind
   - Fix inputPos for situation where context and multipass opcodes
     are involved
   - Fixed a number of bugs with the letter, uppercase and lowercase
     opcodes when dealing with Unicode
   - Fixed a couple of bugs with hyphenation (documentation, Python
     bindings and a number of buffer overruns in the C library).
     Thanks Milan Zamazal <pdm@brailcom.org> for reporting this.
   - Fix a bug in the $a. matcher in the multipass rules where only 32
     chars were matched. It now matches 0xffff chars.
   - Fix a bug reported by James Teh related to pass1Only

** Braille Table Improvements
   - all table files have consistent encoding, UTF-8.
   - The grand table cleanup: Reorganize the tables to remove
     duplication. Move common parts such as Latin letter, eight and
     six dot digit definitions to separate files which are then
     included. This should ease table maintenance. Thanks to Mesar Hameed. 
   - Fixes to de-de-comp8.ctb thanks to Aliminator83@gmail.com
   - hu1.ctb renamed to hu-hu-g1.ctb
   - hu.ctb renamed to hu-hu-comp8.ctb
   - eo.ctb renamed to eo-g1.ctb
   - Fixes to eo-g1.ctb thanks to Aaron Cannon <cannona@fireantproductions.com>

      specifying a number by which the input length is multiplied
      using the outlenMultiplier module variable. The default will

    cells, such as in the Chinese braille tables.
*** outpos when doing back translation
    Include a patch by Timothy Lee to fix outpos when doing back translation
      (issue 11)
*** inputPos/outputPos for undefined characters

    - Fixes to the en-us-g2.ctb table
*** Python bindings
    - Remove unnecessary imports, allowing the bindings to run in Python
      2.7. (issue 12)

      allocate enough bytes for it. Fixes possible buffer overruns and
      resultant crashes.
*** Miscellaneous
    - Fixes to the man page generation to fix issues that were
      reported by the Debian packaging builder
