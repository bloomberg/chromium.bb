* Noteworthy changes in release 3.1.0 (2017-03-06)
An influx of new contributors have made sure that liblouis continues
to improve. Back translation has seen major improvements, there are
some additional modes to help screen readers, for many tables meta
data has been added, the Python bindings are more robust, Windows
support has been improved, the YAML test suite has been generalized
and as usual new and improved braille tables have been included. On
the licensing front we managed to get almost all tables re-licensed to
LGPLv2.1+.

** New features
*** Meta data
Most of the translation tables now contain meta data. This makes them
discoverable. Programs can use the lou_findTable function to find a
table based on a query.

*** noUndefinedDots mode
Add a noUndefinedDots mode to disable the output of dot numbers when
back-translating undefined patterns. Thanks to James Teh.

When back translating input from a braille keyboard cell by cell, it is
desirable to output characters as soon as they are produced.
Similarly, when back translating contracted braille, it is desirable to
provide a "guess" to the user of the characters they typed. To achieve
this, liblouis needs to have the ability to produce no text when
indicators (which don't produce a character by themselves) are not
followed by another cell. This works already for indicators liblouis
knows about such as capital sign, number sign, etc., but it does not
work for indicators which are not (and cannot be) specifically defined
as indicators. For example, in UEB, dots 4 5 6 alone produces the text
"\456/". Setting the noUndefinedDots mode suppresses this dot number
output.

*** partialTrans mode
Add a partialTrans mode to specify that back-translation input should
be treated as an incomplete word. Thanks to James Teh.
  
If this mode is set, rules that apply only for complete words or at
the end of a word will not take effect. This is intended to be used
when translating input typed on a braille keyboard to provide a rough
idea to the user of the characters they are typing before the word is
complete.

*** YAML test framework
The YAML framework has been extended and is much more useful now. You
can test multiple tables within one YAML file, you can define test
tables directly inline and you can test multiple tables using the same
test data. Refer to the documentation for the details.

If really not wanted the YAML tests can be disabled by specifying
~configure --without-yaml~.

** Bug fixes
- Fixes implicit declaration of 'pattern_check' thanks to  Reiner Dolp
- Fix a stackoverflow crash on applications with smaller stack size.
  Thanks to Victor Montalvão.
- Fix the \v escape sequence. Thanks to Davy Kager.
- The Python bindings now give a helpful error if liblouis has been
  compiled with a different character size than Python. Thanks to Matt
  Wenn.
- Massive bug fixes in multipass rules. Dave Mielke has done a
  tremendous job improving the multipass machinery also in the
  context of back-translation. Where needed nofor/noback has been
  added to the multipass rules.

** Other changes
- Improvements to the Emacs mode for editing liblouis tables thanks to
  Christian Egli
- Documenting lou_charSize thanks to Reiner Dolp
- Support for relative table paths in the tests. This will make sure
  you always know which table a test actually uses.
- Infrastructure to build windows binaries in a Docker container,
  thanks to Bert Frees

** Braille table improvements
- UEB improvements, thanks to Mike Gray

  - Added rules for Unicode apostrophe handling
  - Improvements to UEB and Nemeth math
- Complete overhaul of Lithuanian 8-dots table, thanks to Rimas
  Kudelis
- New Urdu 6 Dot Grade 1 and 2 Braille tables thanks to Jake Kyle
- Improvements to Italian 8 dots computer braille, thanks to Simone
  Dal Maso.
- New table ~unicode-braille.utb~ that helps to back translate braille
  input to Unicode braille output, thanks to Leonard de Ruijter.
- Improvements to the Chinese braille table thanks to Coscell Kao.
- New Turkish braille table for grade 1 that should replace the
  old ~tr.ctb~ table, thanks to Arend Arends.
- New Persian grade 1 table and 8-dots computer table thanks to
  Mohammadreza Rashad.
- New table for the International Phonetic Alphabet thanks to Ludovic
  Oger
- Fixes for the French 6 and 8 dots tables thanks to Michel Such. Some
  errors have been fixed and many Unicode characters have been added.
- Add an extended 8-dot computer braille table for U.S. English thanks
  to Davy Kager. The table is tailored for use on Windows (CP-1252)
  and uses dot patterns from Windows screen readers, but should be
  useful on other platforms too.
- New Greek table that is better than the existing Greek Grade 1
  Braille Table (gr-gr-g1.utb) thanks to Dave Mielke.
- Improved number back-translations on fr-fr-g1 and vi-g1 tables
  thanks to Victor Montalvao.
- New Chinese Braille table for use in the mainland of China thanks to
  Kaifang Bao of RejoinTech.
- The Black Circle character is commonly used for displaying password
  characters. The absence of its definition leads to users not being
  able to know how many characters were typed in such fields. This has
  been improved for many tables thanks to Victor Montalvao.

** License changes
- DocArch has agreed to re-license their tables, so we have 8 more
  tables under the LGPLv2.1+.

** Backwards incompatible changes
- The naming in the YAML test framework has changed slightly from
  `tables:` to `table:`.

* Noteworthy changes in release 3.0.0 (2016-07-14)
This is the biggest release of liblouis in years. The major news are
that we now have proper support for UEB and secondly that liblouis is
now licensed under [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html][LGPLv2.1+]].

In order to support UEB the internals of liblouis have seen a major
rewrite. New Opcodes have been added to support the requirements for
proper UEB for example for emphasis handling or to handle proper
translation of numbers. Changes to the opcodes are described in the
documentation. Some of these changes are not backwards compatible. All
tables that come with liblouis have been migrated. If you have private
tables look at the section on upgrading from previous versions in the
[[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/wiki/Emphasis-Opcodes#upgrade-from-previous-versions][wiki]].

This release also changes the C API. External applications will have
to adapt the way they call liblouis. In particular the typeform
parameter has changed.

The license of the library and most of the tables has been changed to
LGPLv2.1. For a detailed list which tables are still in the process of
migrating the license refer to the [[https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/wiki/Licensing-of-liblouis-tables][wiki page about the license change]].

** New features

  - support translation of numbers according to the rules of UEB.
  - Capitalization is now handled just like emphasis.
  - support for numeric mode
- UTF-8 support for all tools thanks to Christian Egli.
- The YAML tests now allow for an optional test description. See the
  documentation for more details.
- Add ~lou_checkTable~ and ~lou_getTypeformForEmphClass~ to the C API
  and to the Python bindings
** Bug fixes
- Stop buffer overrun in ~lou_getProgramPath~, and also free memory
  after usage. Thanks to Michael Curran.
** Other changes
- The license of the library and most of the tables has been changed
  to [[https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html][LGPLv2.1+]].
- Improvements to the test suite:

  functionality has been superceded by the YAML tests. Please use
  these from now on.
- A number of opcodes to handle emphasis have been renamed.
- The C API regarding the typeform parameter has changed.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.5 (2015-12-1)
This minor release introduces new tables (Mongolian and Norwegian 8
dot) and new features to the tracing tool. But the most exiting news
about this release is probably the fact that 12 developers have
contributed to it, showing how widely used liblouis is and how
actively the development progresses.

** New features
- A DEF file is now generated automatically for the windows builds.
  Thanks to Christian Egli
- lou_trace supports backtranslation now. Thanks to Bert Frees

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.4 (2015-08-31)
This is a minor release in terms of features. But in terms of test
coverage and stability it is a vast improvement over previous versions
of Liblouis. The new YAML based test suite contains more than a
million of validated translations. Every change in Liblouis is tested
against this corpus ensuring the change doesn't break anything.

** New features
- YAML based harness tests. Harness tests can now be written in simple
  YAML notation and they are integrated with the normal `make check`
  command. They can be used for both ucs2 and ucs4 and no Python is
  required. Thanks to Christian Egli.

** Bug fixes
- Use a separate gnulib instance for the library and the tools. Use
  the strndup module to avoid build problems on windows.

  currentInput. This fixes the random behavior with tests where the
  emphasis extends to the end of the input string. Thanks to Christian
  Egli.

** Other changes
- if found use texi2any to build the documentation, thanks to Martin
  Michlmayr.
- Fix permissions of Korean tables, thanks to Peter Lundblad.

  Zvonimir Stanecic

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.3 (2015-06-01)
Given the release number you might think this is only a minor release.
However looking at the number of developers who contributed to it and
the number of pull requests and issues that were solved this turns out
to be a very impressive and solid release. Most prominently we have a
new function to discover tables based on meta data in table headers.
Also makeinfo is no longer required to build liblouis. And lastly we
have numerous improvements in Braille tables such as Korean,
Vietnamese and UEB to name just a few.

** New features
- [beta] The new function lou_findTable can be used for table
  discovery based on meta data in table headers. Thanks to Bert Frees.
- The Python API now has a new function to check tables aptly named
  ~checkTable~. Thanks to Davy Kager.

** Bug fixes
- Fixed a problem in resolveTable when using a Java resolver, thanks
  to Bert Frees

** Other changes
- The build dependency on makeinfo is now optional. If it is not
  installed we simply do not build the documentation.

** Braille table improvements
- Improvements to Bengali, Devanagari, Kannada, Gujarati, Malayalam,
  Telugu and Oriya, thanks to Sreeja Param
- Corrections and improvements made to en-GB tables thanks to Paul
  Wood
- Vast restructuring to Korean tables. In 2006 the Institute for Korean
  Braille modified some dots in Korean Braille. Specifically, some
  punctuation dots are now based on English. To accommodate this change
  and to retain the old tables, the Korean table set was revised as
  follows:
  - Added three files: ko-chars, the Korean characters dictionary, and
    rules for g1 and g2.
  - ko-g1 and ko-g2 are now interface files that includes needed
    files.
  - Added three files for Korean Braille 2006 revision along with a
    test harness.
- New table for Polish 8 dot computer braille. Thanks to Karol Pecyna.
- New table for Vietnamese 6 dot. Thanks to Harri Pasanen.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.6.0 (2014-09-01)
This is the first release by the new maintainer team. A lot of work by
people from across the community contributed to this release. There
are massive additions and updates to the Braille tables (e.g.
Afrikaans, Hebrew, many Indian languages, Korean) and also changes to
the C API to enable call backs for error messages and warnings.

** New features
*** New Braille tables
- Tables for Afrikaans, Cherokee, Hawaiian, Maori, Sotho and Tswana
  were donated by Greg Kearney. Afrikaans, Cherokee, Maori and Hawaiian
  all are grade 1 tables and with the exception of Cherokee were
  derived from World Braille Usage 2013. The Cherokee was taken from
  the specification published at www.cbtbc.org/cherokee/.
*** Logging callback
There is now a callback system in place to get error messages and
warnings. This can be used from programs that use liblouis to log
warnings for example.

** Bug fixes
- fix back translation problems when word gets split in unusual places
  causing back translation of whole words for example K5 back
  translates to Knowledgeen, M>k back translates to Moreark, and M5
  back translates to Moren.  This caused over 8400 extra back
  translation errors in en-us-g2 and 5000 in en-ueb-g2. Thanks to Ken
  Perry.
- Fixed bug to prevent removal of \xffff between largesign rules. This
  solves a Liblouisutdml bug where \xffff is used as a segment
  delimiter.
- Fixed a bug in back translation, when a letsign was encountered, the
  letsign was being applied beyond the element it applied to.
- Fix memory leaks in the default table resolver introduced in the
  previous release.
- Fixes to the build system by Simon Aittamaa

** Braille table improvements
- Major improvements to Indian tables thanks to the Indian National
  Institute for Visually Handicapped, in particular Dipendra Manocha,
  Mesar Hameed, Dinesh Kaushall and Sreeja Parameswaran:
  - Corrected opcodes for letters, punctuation marks, digits, signs
    etc.
  - Updated braille codes according to prescribed braille codes for
    each Unicode character by the Braille Council of India for all
    Indian languages.
  - defined rules for dealing with Nukhta character in Hindi table
  - defined rule to insert dot-1 between consonant followed by full
    vowel character in all Indian Languages
  - defined rules for shifting of halant character before the
    consonant. This character is placed after the consonant in normal
    typing but need to be before the consonant in braille. This rule
    is applicable for all Indian languages.
  - defined rules for two conjunct characters "ksha and gya" used in
    all Indian Languages for which there are specific codes in
    Braille.
- New Hebrew table that is based on the new unified Hebrew Braille
  code standard that was put together on January 2014 after a
  conference with all of the specialists in this field in Israel. It
  includes improved representation of Hebrew letters, special letters
  that are called Nikud, and punctuation symbols. The old Braille
  standard is not relevant any more. Thanks to Adi Kushnir.
- UEB table fixes: Fix ity contraction, fixed the missing end word
  contraction ;n ;d sign 46. thanks to Ken Perry.
- Fix for Norwegian where letsign is affecting some extra characters
  thanks to Lars Bjørndal
- Much improved hyphenation for Norwegian thanks to Lars Bjørndal
- Korean Grade 2 now includes support for reading English text using
  grade 2.
- en-us-g1.ctb and en-ueb.g1.ctb are now able to display 8 dot Unicode
  braille.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.4 (2014-03-03)
This release contains nine months worth of braille table improvements
for example for Danish, UEB, en-us, Nemeth, Bulgarian, Slovenian and
many more. Also there are fixes to the core for table path resolving
and back-translation.

     John Boyer.
   - Fixed several problems with back-translation. A slash within a
     number and strings such as 5-inch-diameter and 25-year-old-man
     should now back-translate correctly. Thanks to John Boyer.
   - Fixed a problem with syllable opcode. Thanks to John Boyer.
   - Fix warnings with gcc 4.8.2. Thanks to Peter Lundblad.
   - When a table is specified with an absolute or relative path, the
     "includes" in that table will now work as expected, meaning files
     in the same directory will be found.

** Braille table improvements
   - fr-bfu-comp8.utb: corrections, zero was wrongly displayed in some
     instances.
   - en-us-g2.ctb, en-ueb-g2.ctb: Fixes for that's, can't and s'

     by en-ueb-chardefs.uti

** Invisible changes
   - Refactoring in compileTranslationTable.c: separated more clearly
     the compilation from the table resolving, removed duplicate code,
     etc.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.3 (2013-06-21)
** New features
*** New Braille tables
    - Korean grade 1 and grade 2 thanks to Joseph Lee
    - U.K. English 8 dot computer braille table thanks to David
      Reynolds
    - New Russian literary and computer braille tables thanks to Igor
      B. Poretsky. These replace the older Russian tables which are
      left for backwards compatibility.
    - New hyphenation dictionary for Russian thanks to Igor B.
      Poretsky.
    - Updated hyphenation tables for the Norwegian language (nynorsk
      and bokmål) thanks to Lars Bjørndal.
    - New hyphenation dictionary for Esperanto thanks to Aaron Cannon.
    - New Esperanto grade 1 table, using the x system for accented
      letters, thanks to Aaron Cannon.

*** runHarness.py: 
    Accept filename globs on the commandline to run specific harness files.
    In tests/harness, one can do make <filename> or make runall
    Removed from make check because these checks are checking the validity
    of our tables, rather than validity of the code.

** Braille Table Improvements
   - da-dk-g2.ctb, mostly rewritten to use nocross and hyphenation
     table.
   - Most tables: removed the default collapse whitespace statements,
     if you need to compress whitespace, consider adding compress.ctb
     to the list of tables when processing.
   - Corrections to Unified English Braille Code (Grade 1 and 2),
     thanks to Joseph Lee
   - Corrections to apostrophes in the Computer Spanish 8 dots Braille
     table (Es-Es-G0.utb). Thanks to Juan C. Buno.
   - Corrections for double angle quotation marks and emphasis marks
     in the Norwegian Grade 0 Braille Table. Thanks to Knut Arne
     Bjørndal.
   - Fixes for a minor problem regarding the noletsign in Norwegian
     contracted braille. Thanks to Lars Bjørndal.
   - Corrections to the Italian table thanks to Igor B. Poretsky.
   - Corrections to the Hungarian grade 1 table thanks to Hammer
     Attila
   - Corrections to English, U.S. Grade 2 (ABAE) table. Thanks to Ken
     Perry for reporting the bug and John J. Boyer for fixing it.
   - Further reorganization of the tables to remove duplication. Move
     litdigit opcode common parts and include where needed.
   - Removed obsolete en-us-g1.utb, which has been replaced by
     en-us-g1.ctb.
   - Added dictionary harness tests for: en-ueb-g2.ctb, en-us-g2.ctb.
   - Corrections to Nemeth character definitions thanks to Neil
     Soiffer.
   - Corrections to the Esperanto table thanks to Aaron Cannon.

** Bug Fixes
   - Cursor position calculation is now based on the same code that
     calculates inpos and outpos. This probably solves a number of
     bugs.
   - Fix nocross opcode processing.
   - Fix several buffer over/under runs in
     lou_translateString.c:hyphenate.
   - Fix the '=' problem, i.e. fix inputPositions calculation for the
     case where the equals sign is used as the dots operand. Thanks to
     Bert Frees
   - Fix a bug when resizing a table. Previously not all references to
     this table were updated.

** Backwards incompatible changes
   - The feature that allowed a mapping between language code and
     Braille table was removed as it contained a out-of-bounds access
     bug, was never documented and probably never used. Thanks to
     Peter Nilsson Lundblad and Jeremy Roman for analyzing this
     problem and providing a patch.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.2 (2012-12-18)

While initially planned as mainly a bug fix release this release
contains some notable new features: There is a new tool to trace which
rules have been used to perform a translation. Also along with other
new tables the long awaited table for UEB is finally here.

** New features
*** New tool to trace rule application
    There is a new tool (lou_trace) which helps to trace which rules
    have been used to perform a Braille translation. This is helpful
    for writing Braille tables. See the documentation for more
    information.
*** New Braille tables
    - Inuktitut grade 1, thanks to Greg Kearney.
    - UEB grade 1 and 2, thanks to Joseph Lee. These tables replace
      the old UEB tables (UEBC-g1.utb and UEBC-g2.ctb).
    - Korean table thanks to Joseph Lee

** Braille Table Improvements
   - da-dk-g2.ctb, fixes for transposed â, å, æ, ä, ø  and ö,
     corrected/improved harness tests.
   - Corrections for en-GB-g2.ctb thanks to Paul Wood
   - Corrections to the Hungarian grade 1 table thanks to Hammer
     Attila

** Bug Fixes
   - Update gnulib
   - Fix a bug in the correct opcode which causes sometimes random
     results when translating. Thanks to Bert Frees.

   - Fix some Valgrind warnings about invalid reads
 
* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.1 (2012-9-24)

** Braille Table Improvements
- Fix encoding problem in italian table and added more character
  definitions. Thanks to Simone Dal Maso <simone.dalmaso@juvox.it>.
- Rename it-it-g1.utb to it-it-comp6.utb and it-it-g1.utb2 to
  it-it-comp8.utb.

** Bug fixes
- Fix outputPos and inlen where an input character generates multiple
  output characters.

* Noteworthy changes in release 2.5.0 (2012-9-10)

This release contains a tremendous amount of work many developers.
Many long standing bugs have been fixed. The tables can finally be in
UTF-8. A grand table cleanup removed duplication from the tables.
There are now two extensive test frameworks for table writers. A
number of new tables have been contributed on top of the usual
assortment of table improvements. Thanks to all of this liblouis has
already seen quite a bit of uptake in a number of places, notably the
new DAISY pipeline will ship with this release of liblouis.

NOTE: If you have private tables you might want to migrate them to
utf-8. To do this just use iconv as follows:

  $ iconv -f latin-1 -t utf-8 <input >output

** New features
*** New Braille tables
    - Estonian grade 0, thanks to Jürgen Dengo.
    - Portuguese 8 dot Computer braille, Thanks to Rui Fontes
*** UTF-8 support in tables
    Braille tables can now contain UTF-8 in the opcode arguments.
*** Improvements to the python bindings
    All constants defined in liblouis.h are now exposed in the bindings.
*** Add a doctest infrastructure
    These tests are based on the Python doctest framework and are only
    run if there is a Python interpreter on the system
*** Add a test harness
    This test infrastructure allows the user to do table tests in a
    simple and concise syntax. These tests are based on the Python
    nose testing framework and are only run if either Python 2.x or
    3.x with the related nose python module is installed on the
    system. See the documentation for more information. Thanks to
    Mesar Hameed.
*** Add a test harness generator
    A harness generator that uses simple text files with a little
    formatting to help to generate the json harness files. The purpose
    of this tool is to make it much easier and faster to add checks
    for a given table. You are expected to read the generated harness
    file and make necessary changes, the tool only helps you to get
    the tests into the harness format, not check their validity.
*** Support for Python 3 in the Python bindings
    The Python bindings now work for both Python 2 and Python 3.
    Thanks to Michael Whapples.

** Improved C-based test framework
   - Improved the test framework to be able to test translations
     involving Unicode.
   - Added numerous tests, e.g. for lowercase and Unicode, for the
     input position, for repeated, etc.

** Improved the documentation
   - Document the test harness (json format, fields, flags).
   - Document the use of Valgrind to find memory leaks
   - Improve the documentation on the display opcode

** Bug fixes
   - lou_allround and lou_translate now properly handle Unicode
     characters
   - Fix some issues reported by Valgrind
   - Fix inputPos for situation where context and multipass opcodes
     are involved
   - Fixed a number of bugs with the letter, uppercase and lowercase
     opcodes when dealing with Unicode
   - Fixed a couple of bugs with hyphenation (documentation, Python
     bindings and a number of buffer overruns in the C library).
     Thanks Milan Zamazal <pdm@brailcom.org> for reporting this.
   - Fix a bug in the $a. matcher in the multipass rules where only 32
     chars were matched. It now matches 0xffff chars.
   - Fix a bug reported by James Teh related to pass1Only

** Braille Table Improvements
   - all table files have consistent encoding, UTF-8.
   - The grand table cleanup: Reorganize the tables to remove
     duplication. Move common parts such as Latin letter, eight and
     six dot digit definitions to separate files which are then
     included. This should ease table maintenance. Thanks to Mesar Hameed. 
   - Fixes to de-de-comp8.ctb thanks to Aliminator83@gmail.com
   - hu1.ctb renamed to hu-hu-g1.ctb
   - hu.ctb renamed to hu-hu-comp8.ctb
