=head1 NAME

File::HomeDir::Driver - Base class for all File::HomeDir drivers

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is the base class for all L<File::HomeDir> drivers, and must
be inherited from to identify a class as a driver.

It is primarily provided as a convenience for this specific identification
purpose, as L<File::HomeDir> supports the specification of custom drivers
and an C<-E<gt>isa> check is used during the loading of the driver.
