=head1 NAME

Specio::Exception - An exception class for type constraint failures

=head1 VERSION

version 0.43

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Try::Tiny;

  try {
      $type->validate_or_die($value);
  }
  catch {
      if ( $_->isa('Specio::Exception') ) {
          print $_->message, "\n";
          print $_->type->name, "\n";
          print $_->value, "\n";
      }
  };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This exception class is thrown by Specio when a type check fails. It emulates
the L<Throwable::Error> API, but doesn't use that module to avoid adding a
dependency on L<Moo>.

=for Pod::Coverage BUILD throw

=head1 API

This class provides the following methods:

=head2 $exception->message

The error message associated with the exception.

=head2 $exception->stack_trace

A L<Devel::StackTrace> object for the exception.

=head2 $exception->type

The type constraint object against which the value failed.

=head2 $exception->value

The value that failed the type check.

=head2 $exception->as_string

The exception as a string. This includes the method and the stack trace.

=head1 OVERLOADING

This class overloads stringification to call the C<as_string> method.
