=head1 NAME

parinstallppd - Install PPD/PPM packages using PAR

=head1 SYNOPSIS

parinstallppd --help

parinstallppd [-v ...] -u PPD-URI-OR-FILE

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script converts packages for the I<Perl Package Manager>
which is specific to ActiveState's perl distributions to F<.par>
files and installs those using L<PAR::Dist>.

It works much the same way as the L<ppd2par> tool but with an additional
installation step after the conversion.

=head2 Parameters

  -u --uri
    Set the place to fetch the .ppd file from. Can be an URL
    (http://..., https://..., ftp://...) or a local file.
  -v --verbose
    Sets the verbose mode.

  --sa --selectarch
    Regexp for selecting the implementation based on architecture.
    Defaults to the currently running architecture.
  --sp --selectperl
    Regexp for selecting the implementation based on perl version.
    Defaults to the currently running perl version (e.g. 5.8.8) and falls
    back to the main version (e.g. 5.8) and then other sub-versions
    (e.g. 5.8.7)

=head1 SEE ALSO
