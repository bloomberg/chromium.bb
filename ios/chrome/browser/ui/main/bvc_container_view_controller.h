// A UIViewController instance designed to contain an instance of

// implements a great deal of custom logic around handling view controller
// presentation and other features, this containing view controller handles
// forwarding calls to the BVC instance where needed.

// This class isn't coupled to any implementation details of the BVC; it could
// be used as a generic forwarding container if needed. In that case, its name
// should be changed.

// will be removed as a child view controller, and the new |currentBVC| will
// be added as a child and have its view resized to this object's view's bounds.
