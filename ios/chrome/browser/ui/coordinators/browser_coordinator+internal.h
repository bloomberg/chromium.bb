// Internal API for subclasses and categories of BrowserCoordinator.
//
// This API can be used to create and manage 'overlay coordinators'.
// Overlay coordinators are intended to be used for UI elements that
// sit on top of the regular UI, and which may need to be dismissed
// by coordinators that don't have direct access to them. Typical uses
// would be alerts, login prompts, or other UI that might be dismissed
// if (for example) an external event causes a web page to load.
// Overlay coordinators can be added by any coordinator in the coordinator
// hierarchy, but they will be children of (generally) the topmost
// coordinator, regardless of which coordinator added them.
@interface BrowserCoordinator (Internal)

// Managed view controller of this object. Subclasses must define a
// property named |viewController| that has the specific UIViewController
// subclass they use; the subclass API will be able to access that view
// controller through this property.

// nothing happens.
