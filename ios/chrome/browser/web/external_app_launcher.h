// by the |sourcePageURL| page in a short time frame, in that case a prompt will
// appear to the user with an option to block the application from launching.
// Then the method also checks for user interaction and for schemes that require
// special handling (eg. facetime, mailto) and may present the user with a
// confirmation dialog to open the application.
// If there is no such application available or it's not possible to open the
// application the method returns NO.
