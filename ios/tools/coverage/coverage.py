"""Script to generate code coverage report for iOS.

  The generated code coverage report excludes test files, and test files are
  identified by postfixes: ['unittest.cc', 'unittest.mm', 'egtest.mm'].
  TODO(crbug.com/763957): Make test file identifiers configurable.

  NOTE: This script must be called from the root of checkout. It may take up to
        a few minutes to generate a report for targets that depend on Chrome,
        such as ios_chrome_unittests. To simply play with this tool, you are
        suggested to start with 'url_unittests'.

  Example usages:
  ios/tools/coverage/coverage.py url_unittests -t url/ -i url/third_party
  # Generate code coverage report for url_unittests for directory url/ and only
  # include files under url/third_party.

  ios/tools/coverage/coverage.py url_unittests -t url/ -i url/third_party
  -r coverage.profdata
  # Skip running tests and reuse the specified profile data file.

  ios/tools/coverage/coverage.py url_unittests -t url/ -i url/third_party
  -e //url/ipc:url_ipc -r coverage.profdata
  # Exclude the 'sources' of //url/ipc:url_ipc build target.

  For more options, please refer to ios/tools/coverage/coverage.py -h
