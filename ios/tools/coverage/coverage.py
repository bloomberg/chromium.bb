"""Script to generate code coverage report for iOS.

  The generated code coverage report excludes test files, and test files are
  identified by postfixes: ['unittest.cc', 'unittest.mm', 'egtest.mm'].
  TODO(crbug.com/763957): Make test file identifiers configurable.

  NOTE: This script must be called from the root of checkout. It may take up to
        a few minutes to generate a report for targets that depend on Chrome,
        such as ios_chrome_unittests. To simply play with this tool, you are
        suggested to start with 'url_unittests'.

  ios/tools/coverage/coverage.py -p path1 -p path2 target
    Generate code coverage report for |target| for |path1| and |path2|.

  ios/tools/coverage/coverage.py target -p path --reuse-profdata
  out/Coverage-iphonesimulator/coverage.profdata
    Skip running tests and reuse the specified profile data file to generate
    code coverage report.

  For more options, please refer to ios/tools/coverage/coverage.py -h
