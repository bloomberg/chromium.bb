To run the GCE commands, you need to install the gcloud tool:
  curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash

Please run `gcloud auth login` to authenticate your account.

When running `gcloud compute ssh` for the first time, you will be
prompted to generate ssh keys. The scripts in this directory require
you having an empty passphrase, so that you will not be prompted to
enter the passphrase for every command.
