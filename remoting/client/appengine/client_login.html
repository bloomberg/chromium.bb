    ClientLogin token for Google Talk.

    <form method="post" name="auth">
      Username: <input type="text" name="username" /><br />
      Password: <input type="password" name="password" /><br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />

    Yes, we know we're asking for your Google Accounts credentials in a webapp.

    <p>
    No we're not happy with this.

    <p>
    Yes, we (think we) need to do it this way.

    <p>
    libjingle needs a ClientLogin token and due to single-origin issues, we
    have to proxy the request through the webapp.  If anyone has a better idea,
    please <b>please</b> <b><i>please</i></b> let us know.
