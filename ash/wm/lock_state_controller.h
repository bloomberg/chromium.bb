// Displays onscreen animations and locks or suspends the system in response to
// the power button being pressed or released.
// Lock workflow:
// Entry points:
//  * StartLockAnimation (bool shutdown after lock) - starts lock that can be
//    cancelled.
//  * StartLockAnimationAndLockImmediately (bool shutdown after lock) - starts
//    uninterruptible lock animation.
// This leads to call of either StartImmediatePreLockAnimation or
// StartCancellablePreLockAnimation. Once they complete
// PreLockAnimationFinished is called, and system lock is requested.
// Once system locks and lock UI is created, OnLockStateChanged is called, and
// StartPostLockAnimation is called. In PostLockAnimationFinished two
// things happen : EVENT_LOCK_ANIMATION_FINISHED notification is sent (it
// triggers third part of animation within lock UI), and check for continuing to
// shutdown is made.
//
// Unlock workflow:
// WebUI does first part of animation, and calls OnLockScreenHide(callback) that
// triggers StartUnlockAnimationBeforeUIDestroyed(callback). Once callback is
// called at the end of the animation, lock UI is deleted, system unlocks, and
// OnLockStateChanged is called. It leads to
// StartUnlockAnimationAfterUIDestroyed.
