    <description summary="global registry object">
      The global registry object.  The server has a number of global
      objects that are available to all clients.  These objects
      typically represent an actual object in the server (for example,
      an input device) or they are singleton objects that provide
      extension functionality.

      When a client creates a registry object, the registry object
      will emit a global event for each global currently in the
      registry.  Globals come and go as a result of device or
      monitor hotplugs, reconfiguration or other events, and the
      registry will send out global and global_remove events to
      keep the client up to date with the changes.  To mark the end
      of the initial burst of events, the client can use the
      wl_display.sync request immediately after calling
      wl_display.get_registry.

      A client can bind to a global object by using the bind
      request.  This creates a client-side handle that lets the object
      emit events to the client and lets the client invoke requests on
      the object.

	together define in which directions the surface's size changes.

	Surface contents are double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.

	The initial surface contents are void; there is no content.
	wl_surface.attach assigns the given wl_buffer as the pending wl_buffer.
	wl_surface.commit makes the pending wl_buffer the new
	surface contents, and the size of the surface becomes the size of
	the wl_buffer. After commit, there is no pending buffer until the
	next attach.

	Committing a pending wl_buffer allows the compositor to read the
	pixels in the wl_buffer. The compositor may access the pixels at any
	time after the wl_surface.commit request. When the compositor will
	not access the pixels anymore, it will send the wl_buffer.release

	the wl_buffer. A wl_buffer, that has been attached and then replaced
	by another attach instead of committed, will not receive a release
	event, and is not used by the compositor.

	Destroying the wl_buffer after wl_buffer.release does not change the
	surface contents. However, if the client destroys the wl_buffer
	before receiving wl_buffer.release, the surface contents become
	undefined immediately.

	Only if wl_surface.attach is sent with a nil wl_buffer, the

      <description summary="transform from framebuffer to output">
	This describes the transform that a compositor will apply to a
	surface to compensate for the rotation or mirroring of an
	output device.

	The flipped values correspond to an initial flip around a
	vertical axis followed by rotation.

	The purpose is mainly to allow clients render accordingly and
	tell the compositor, so that for fullscreen surfaces, the
	compositor will still be able to scan out directly from client
	surfaces.

	The mode event describes an available mode for the output.
	The event is sent when binding to the output object and there
	will always be one mode, the current mode.  The event is sent
	again if an output changes mode, for the mode that is now
	current.  In other words, the current mode is always the last
	mode that was received with the current flag set.
