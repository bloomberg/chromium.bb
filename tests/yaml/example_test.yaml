# lines starting with '#' are comments
# first define which tables will be used for your tests
tables: [unicode.dis, en-ueb-g1.ctb]

# then optionally define flags such as testmode. If no flags are
# defined forward translation is assumed

# now define the tests
tests:
  - # each test is a list.
    # The first item is the string to translate. Quoting of strings is
    # optional
    - hello
    # The second item is the expected translation
    - ⠓⠑⠇⠇⠕
  - # optionally you can define additional parameters in a third
    # item such as typeform or expected failure, etc
    - Hello
    - ⠨⠶⠠⠓⠑⠇⠇⠕⠨⠄
    - {typeform: '11110', xfail: true}
  - # a simple, no-frills test
    - Good bye
