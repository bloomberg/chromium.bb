;; For now, we are using a .ll file as a "pexe". This is only a bad pexe
;; in the sense that it shouldn't compile (missing instruction),
;; not that it will crash LLC. Eventually we should make this into

;; To actually crash LLC (and do so reliably), perhaps we could add

;; That seems much more reliable than trying to find a bitcode file that
;; for version X will crash LLC, but for version Y it has been fixed.
